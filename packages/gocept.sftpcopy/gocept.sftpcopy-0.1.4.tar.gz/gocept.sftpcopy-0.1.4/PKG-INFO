Description: ========
        SFTPCopy
        ========
        
        sftpcopy allows to copy files to or from a remote server -- integrates with
        gocept.filestore. sftpcopy will take files from the `new` directory, copy
        them to the remote server and put them into `cur` on success. Likewise it will
        download files from the remote server and put them into the `new` directory for
        another application to pick it up.
        
        All together this allows quite stable and asynchronous data transfer.
        
        TODO
        ====
        
        * Documentation
        * Tests!
        * Interfaces would be nice :)
        
        
        ========
        SFTPCopy
        ========
        
        Configure an sftpcopy:
        
        >>> import tempfile
        >>> import gocept.filestore
        >>> import gocept.sftpcopy
        >>> store_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
        >>> filestore = gocept.filestore.FileStore(store_dir)
        >>> filestore.prepare()
        >>> sftp = gocept.sftpcopy.SFTPCopy(
        ...     'download', filestore,
        ...     'localhost', 22, 'test', 'D>Mx,62I', 'tmp')
        
        
        After connecting ...
        
        >>> sftp.connect()
        
        ... we can download ...
        
        >>> sftp.copyNewFiles()
        
        ... and upload files ...
        
        >>> sftp.uploadNewFiles()
        
        Those methods doe not put anything out if there is no error.
        
        
        Cleanup
        =======
        
        >>> sftp.close()
        >>> import shutil
        >>> shutil.rmtree(store_dir)
