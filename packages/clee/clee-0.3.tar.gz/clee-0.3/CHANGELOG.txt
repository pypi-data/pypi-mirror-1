=== 2006.04.18 === 0.3
* Broke backwards compatibility pretty majorly by switching to the
  new sprinkles stuff.
* * Things that used to extend CleeSprinkle should
    now implements(ICleeSprinkle) and things that used to extend
    CleeContextSprinkle should extend CleeContextSprinkleMixin and
    implements ICleeContextSprinkle and such
* * the __init__'s on the sprinkled clee classes now take
    a package argument rather than all the various keywords
  
* Removed dependency on charcoal

=== 2006.01.23 === 0.2.2
* added an extra method to extend the options of a class,
  using standard_option_list was annoying, you can now
  simply add opt_* properties to the subclass to give it new
  options
* added opt_enable and opt_disable, they make lists, non-default

=== 2005.09.11 === 0.2.1
* made the filtering system easier to use for sprinkled clee + friends
  you can now pass in `filterer` as a keyword to the constructor
