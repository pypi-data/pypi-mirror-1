        Introduction
        --------------
        
        "If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, I would call it a duck."
        
        Zhpy acts like python and play like python, you (chinese users)
        
        could use it as python.
        
        Zhpy is the full feature python language with fully tested chinese
        
        keywords, variables, and parameters support. Independent on python
        
        version, bundle with command line tool, chinese shell script capability,
        
        interpreter, pluggable keyword system,
        
        bi-directional zhpy <-> python code translation, and great document.
        
        Zhpy on python is good for Taiwan and China beginners to learn python in
        
        our native language (Traditional and Simplified chinese).
        
        The core of zhpy is a lightweight python module and a chinese
        source convertor based on python, which provides interpreter and
        command line tool to translate zhpy code to python.
        
        zhpy integrated a setuptools-based plugin system and in-place ini reference
        feature for keyword reuse.
        
        The zhpy code written in traditional and simplified chinese could be
        translated and converted to natual python code.
        Thus it could be execute as nature python code and be used in
        normal python programs.
        
        Normal python programs could be translated to traditional(.twpy) or
        simplified(.cnpy) chinese zhpy source via 'zhpy' command line tool.
        
        You could use 'zhpy' command instead of "python" in command line to execute
        source code wrote in either Chinese or English.
        
        Zhpy also provide a method 'zh_exec' that allow you to embed
        chinese script in python; Zhpy could be used as the chinese
        shell script as well.
