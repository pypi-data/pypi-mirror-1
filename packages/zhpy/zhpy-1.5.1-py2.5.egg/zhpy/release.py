Introduction
--------------

"If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, I would call it a duck."

Zhpy acts like python and play like python, you (chinese users)
could use it as python (plus with your native language).

Zhpy on python is good for Taiwan and China beginners to learn python in
our native language (Traditional and Simplified chinese).

Zhpy is the full feature python language with fully tested chinese
keywords, variables, and parameters support. Zhpy is INDEPENDENT on python
version(2.4, 2.5....), bundle with command line tool, interpreter,
bi-directional zhpy <-> python code translation, 
chinese shell script capability, in-place ini reference
feature for keyword reuse, and great document.

The core of zhpy is a lightweight python module and a chinese
source convertor based on python, which provides interpreter and
command line tool to translate zhpy code to python.

See http://www.flickr.com/photos/gasolin/2064120327

You could use 'zhpy' command instead of "python" in command line to execute
source code wrote in either Chinese or English.

Zhpy also provide a method 'zh_exec' that allow you to embed
chinese script in python; Zhpy could be used as the chinese
shell script as well.

The zhpy code written in traditional and simplified chinese could be
translated and converted to natual python code.
Thus it could be execute as nature python code and be used in
normal python programs.

Bidirectional python-zhpy translation is possible.
Normal python programs could be translated to traditional(.twpy) or
simplified(.cnpy) chinese zhpy source via 'zhpy' command line tool.
