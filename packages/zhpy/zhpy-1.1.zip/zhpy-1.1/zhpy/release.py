bundle with command line tool, interpreter, pluggable keyword system and 
great document.

zhpy on python is good for Taiwan and China beginners to learn python in 
our native language.

The core of zhpy is a lightweight python module and a chinese source convertor
based on python, 
which provides interpreter and command line tool to translate zhpy code to
python. zhpy integrated a setuptools-based plugin system for keyword reuse.
The zhpy code written in traditional and simplified
chinese could be translated and converted to natual python code.
Thus it could be execute as nature python code and be used in normal
python programs.

Use 'zhpy' command instead of "python" in command line to execute source
code wrote in Chinese and English.

zhpy provide a method 'zh_exec' that allow to embed
chinese script in python, and zhpy could be used as the chinese script in
shell as well.
