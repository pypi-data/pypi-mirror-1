How-to

On a page, click actions -> Add Slider.  It should bring you to a slider settings page where you can modify different aspects of the slider.  Keep in mind that the slides are fixed width so you need to specify the size you want.  Then you'll want to start adding your slides.  To do this just click ``add new slide`` near the bottom of the page.  Once you've finished adding slides and re-ordering slides, click ``save`` and you should see the slider on your page now.
