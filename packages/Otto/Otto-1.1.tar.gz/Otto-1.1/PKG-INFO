        Overview
        ========
        
        Otto is an HTTP publisher which uses a routes-like syntax to map URLs
        to code. It supports object traversal.
        
        You can use the publisher to write web applications. It was designed
        with both small and large applications in mind. We have tried to
        incorporate elements of existing publishers to allow diverse and
        flexible application patterns while still being in concordance with
        the :term:`Zen Of Python`.
        
        Here's a variation of a familiar theme::
        
        import otto
        import webob
        import wsgiref.simple_server
        
        app = otto.Application()
        
        @app.connect("/*path/:name")
        def hello_world(request, path=None, name=u'world'):
        return webob.Response(u"An %d-deep hello %s!" % (len(path), name))
        
        wsgiref.simple_server.make_server('', 8080, app).serve_forever()
        
        This release is compatible with Python 2.4+.
        
        See the `documentation <http://www.ottohttp.org/docs/1.1/>`_ for this release.
