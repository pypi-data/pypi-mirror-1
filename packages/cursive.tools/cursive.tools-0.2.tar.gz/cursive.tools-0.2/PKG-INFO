Description: This package provides a ``cursive`` command that is intended to become
        the core of a whole set of tools for working with `reStructured Text`_
        documents.  The command supports sub-commands, some of which come
        built-in with this package, and others that become available as other
        cursive modules are installed.
        
        The single built-in command available at this point is:
        
        ``cursive wc <filename>``
        Word count: ignoring headers, code snippets, and comments, this
        routine figures out the number of words in your document, and prints
        out a total both for each section of your document separately and
        also for the document as a whole.
        
        The other module currently available to supplement cursive is the
        `cursive.pymag`_ package, which will format an article for publication
        in Python Magazine.
