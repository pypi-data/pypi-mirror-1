``cursive.tools``: Tools for authoring restructured text files
==============================================================

The routines in this ``cursive.tools`` package are designed for authors.
They provide command-line tools that can examine Restructured Text files
to perform basic operations like displaying their structure, and
counting how many words they include.

Well, okay, maybe that's an exaggeration.  The package currently
supplies a single command-line tool for counting words; but, I figured
that would be a good start.
