Description: The routines in this ``cursive.tools`` package are designed for authors.
        They provide command-line tools that can examine Restructured Text files
        to perform basic operations like displaying their structure, and
        counting how many words they include.
        
        Well, okay, maybe that's an exaggeration.  The package currently
        supplies a single command-line tool for counting words; but, I figured
        that would be a good start.
