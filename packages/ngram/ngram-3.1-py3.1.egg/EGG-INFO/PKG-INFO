Description: The NGram class is a set that supports searching for its members by
        N-Gram string similarity.
        
        It is a full subclass of the built-in `set` that maintains N-Gram
        indexing on all set operations.
        
        The algorithm is based from `String::Trigram
        <http://search.cpan.org/dist/String-Trigram/>`_ by Tarek Ahmed.
