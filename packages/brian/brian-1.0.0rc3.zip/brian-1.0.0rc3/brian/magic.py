"""Magic function tools

Use these functions to automagically find objects of a particular class. The way it works is that
whenever a new object is created from a class derived from InstanceTracker, it is stored along
with the 'frame' it was called from (loosely speaking, the function where the object is defined).
When you call one of the functions below, it picks out all the objects of the required type in
a frame a specified number of levels before the current one (e.g. in the frame of the calling
function). 

Functions
---------

get_instances(instancetype,level=1)
    This function finds all instances at the given level in the sequence of calling frames
    
find_instances(instancetype,startlevel=1)
    This function searches the frames starting from the given startlevel until it finds at least
    one object of the required type, at which point it will return all objects of that type from
    that level

find_all_instances(instancetype,startlevel=1):
    This function searches the frames starting from the given startlevel, and returns all objects of
    the required type from all levels. Noe that includeglobals is set to False by default so as not
    to pick up multiple copies of objects

Variables:

instancetype
    A class (must be derived from InstanceTracker)
level
    The level in the sequence of calling frames. So, for a function f, calling with level=0 will
    find variables defined in that function f, whereas calling with level=1 will find variables
    defined in the function which called f. The latter is the default value because magic
    functions are usually used within Brian functions to find variables defined by the user.

Return values:

All the functions return a tuple (objects, names) where objects is the list of matching objects,
and names is a list of strings giving the objects' names if they are defined. At the moment, the
only name returned is the id of the object.

Notes:

These functions return each object at most once.

Classes
-------

InstanceTracker
    Derive your class from this one to automagically keep track of instances of it. If you
    want a subclass of a tracked class not to be tracked, define the method _track_instances
    to return False.

    Functions
    ~~~~~~~~~

    Here instancetype is a class derived from :class:`InstanceTracker`, including
    :class:`Clock`, :class:`NeuronGroup`, :class:`Connection`, :class:`NetworkOperation`.
    ``level`` is an integer
    greater than 0 that tells the function how far back it should search
    in the sequence of called functions. ``level=0`` means it should find
    instances from the function calling one of the magic functions,
    ``level=1`` means it should find instances from the function calling the
    function calling one of the magic functions, etc.
    
    :func:`get_instances` returns all instances at a specified level.
    :func:`find_instances`
    searches increasing levels starting from the given ``startlevel`` until it
    finds a nonzero number of instances, and then returns those.
    :func:`find_all_instances` finds all instances from a given level onwards.
    
    Classes
    ~~~~~~~
    
    An object of a class ``cls`` derived from ``InstanceTracker`` will be tracked
    if ``cls._track_instances()`` returns ``True``. The default behaviour of
    ``InstanceTracker`` is to always return ``True``, but this method can be
    redefined if you do not want to track instances of a particular
    subclass of a tracked class. Note that this method is a static method
    of a class, and cannot be used to stop particular instances being
    tracked. Redefine it using something like::
        
        class A(InstanceTracker):
            pass
        class B(A):
            @staticmethod
            def _track_instances(): return False

    A warning (technical detail)
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    The current implementation of instance tracking will return
    every variable that was created in a given execution frame (i.e. in
    a given function) that is still alive (i.e. a reference still exists
    to it somewhere). So for example, the following will not find any
    instance::
    
        class A(InstanceTracker):
            pass
        def f(A):
            return A()
        a = f(A)
        print get_instances(A,level=0)
    
    The reason is that the object a was created in the function ``f``, but
    the :func:`get_instances` statement is run in the main body. Similarly, the
    following will return two instances rather than one as you might
    expect::
    
        class A(InstanceTracker):
            pass
        def f(A):
            a = A()
            return get_instances(A,level=0)
        insts1 = f(A)
        isnts2 = f(A)
        print insts2
    
    The reason is that the first call to ``f`` defines an instance of ``A`` and
    returns (via :func:`get_instances`) an object which contains a reference to it.
    The object is still therefore alive. The second call to ``f`` creates a new
    ``A`` object, but the :func:`get_instances` call returns both ``A`` objects, because they
    are both still alive (the first is stored in ``insts1``) and both created
    in the function ``f``.
    
    This behaviour is not part of the assured interface of the magic module,
    and you shouldn't rely on it.

            return PulsePacket(50*ms, 100, 10*ms)
    
    **Explanation**
    
    Normally, code like the following wouldn't work::

        def f():
            return PulsePacket(50*ms, 100, 10*ms)

        show()
    
    The reason is that the magic function :func:`run()` only recognises objects created
    in the same execution frame that it is run from. The :func:`magic_return` decorator
    corrects this, it registers the return value of a function with the magic
    module. The following code will work as expected::

        @magic_return
        def f():
            return PulsePacket(50*ms, 100, 10*ms)
        pp = f()

        show()
    
    **Technical details**

    on just the object returned by a function. See details for :func:`magic_register`.
