Description: plone.memoize provides Python function decorators for caching the
        values of functions and methods.
        
        The type of cache storage is freely configurable by the user, as is
        the cache key, which is what the function's value depends on.
        
        plone.memoize has support for memcached and is easily extended to use
        other caching storages.  It also has specialized decorators for use
        with Zope views.  However, plone.memoize can be used without Zope.
