plone.memoize - 1.0 Released August 17th 2007

    - Add a forever memo - lives until Zope restart.
      [optilude]

    - Extended the xhtml_compress method to use a utility lookup for
      IXHTMLCompressor utilities instead. Now you can turn the slimmer based
      compression on via a simple utility registration. See compress.py.
      [hannosch, fschulze]

    - Added simple xhtml_compress method which can be used to plug in
      whitespace removal libraries. Peter Bengtsson's slimmer library is
      configured but not enabled by default.
      [hannosch]

    - Use a md5 hash of the provided key in RAMCacheAdapter, reducing the
      memory footprint and speeding up lookup time.
      [hannosch]

    - rolled in changes from memojito to fix recursively memoized
      methods(fix by Rob Miller and Whit Morriss)
      [whit]

    - made plone.memoize backwardly compatible with zope2.9 and remain
      usable w/out zope.annotation. Minor wording changes to some docs.
      [whit]

    - Initial package structure.
