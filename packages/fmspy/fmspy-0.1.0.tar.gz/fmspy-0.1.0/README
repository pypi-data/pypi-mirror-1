FMSPy provides implementation of RTMP protocol upon Twisted Framework.
On top of protocol implementation it builds server for Flash/Flex clients.

At the moment FMSPy supports:
- basic RPC support;
- application plugin infrastructure (applications are designed as FMSPy plugins);
- application API.

- live webcam audo/video streaming;
- streaming from disk and writing streams to disk;
