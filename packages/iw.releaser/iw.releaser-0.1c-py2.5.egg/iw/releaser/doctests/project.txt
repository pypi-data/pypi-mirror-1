this module releases a buildout, by copying the current one
into a release branch and making a few changes over the .cfg files.

Let's release our buildoutn located in tests::

    >>> buildout_folder = os.path.join(test_dir, 'data', 'buildout')
    >>> import os
    >>> os.chdir(buildout_folder)

Let's release it::

    >>> from project import make_release

    >>> make_release('0.1')
    branch was existing, removed
    copied http://xxx/my.package/trunk to http://xxx/my.package/releases/0.1

Now we can deploy it::

    >>> from project import deploy_release
    >>> deploy_release('http://xxx/my.project/releases/0.1')
    
Let's check the result::

    >>> [el for el in os.listdir(buildout_folder) if os.path.isdir(el)
    ...  and el not in ('.svn',)]
    ['bin', 'develop-eggs', 'eggs', 'parts']

Now let's remove created folders::
    
    >>> import shutil
    >>> for folder in ['bin', 'develop-eggs', 'eggs', 'parts']:
    ...     shutil.rmtree(folder)
