Description: plone.z3cform
        =============
        
        plone.z3cform is a library that allows use of z3c.form with Zope 2 and
        Plone.
        
        More documentation to come.  For now, please refer to the
        ``collective.dancing`` package for examples of use.
        
        Uberselection widget
        --------------------
        
        This package provides a query source compatible with
        ``z3c.formwidget.query`` which combines to an uberselection widget for
        the ``z3c.form`` form generation framework.
        
        The native value type for the widget is Archetypes UID collections.
        
        Example:
        
        >>> from plone.z3cform.uberselect import \
        ...     ArchetypesContentSourceBinder
        
        >>> class ISelection(interface.Interface):
        ...     items = schema.Set(
        ...         title=u"Selection",
        ...         description=u"Search for content.",
        ...         value_type=schema.Choice(
        ...             source=ArchetypesContentSourceBinder()
        ...         )
        ...     )
        
        A recipe to store references as ``persistent.wref.WeakRef`` instead of
        UID is to use the ``uid2wref`` adapter between the form and the
        context.
        
        >>> from plone.z3cform.uberselect import uid2wref
        
        >>> Factory = uid2wref(ISelection['items'])
        
        To store weak references instead of UIDs you would register such a
        factory as a component adapting the context. The factory automatically
        provides the interface which defines the field.
