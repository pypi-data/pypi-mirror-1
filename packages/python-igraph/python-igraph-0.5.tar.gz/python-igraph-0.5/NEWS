python-igraph 0.5
=================

New in the Python interface:
- Added shell interface: igraph can now be invoked by calling the script called
  igraph from the command line. The script launches the Python interpreter and
  automatically imports igraph functions into the main namespace
- Pickling (serialization) support for Graph objects
- Plotting functionality based on the Cairo graphics library (so you need to
  install python-cairo if you want to use it). Currently the following
  objects can be plotted: graphs, adjacency matrices and dendrograms. Some
  crude support for plotting histograms is also implemented. Plots can be
  saved in PNG, SVG and PDF formats.
- Unified Graph.layout method for accessing layout algorithms
- Added interfaces to walktrap community detection and the BLISS isomorphism
  algorithm
- Added dyad and triad census functionality and motif counting
- VertexSeq and EdgeSeq objects can now be restricted to subsets of the
  whole network (e.g., you can select vertices/edges based on attributes,
  degree, centrality and so on)
