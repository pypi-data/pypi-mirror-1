        Installation
        ============
        
        To install quintagroup.seoptimizer into the global Python environment (or a workingenv), using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:
        
        * Copy ``quintagroup`` folder to the /path/to/instance/lib/python directory.
        
        * Create a file called ``quintagroup.seoptimizer-overrides.zcml`` in the /path/to/instance/etc/package-includes directory. The file should only contain this::
        
        <include package="quintagroup.seoptimizer" file="overrides.zcml" />
        
        * Restart the Zope server, for example with the following command in the terminal::
        
        $ ./bin/zopectl restart
        
        
        Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to manage your project, you can do this:
        
        * Add ``quintagroup.seoptimizer`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
        
        [buildout]
        ....
        eggs =
        ...
        quintagroup.seoptimizer
        
        * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::
        
        [instance]
        ...
        zcml =
        quintagroup.seoptimizer
        quintagroup.seoptimizer-overrides
        
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
        
        $ ./bin/buildout
        
        * Restart the Zope server, e.g with the following command in the terminal::
        
        $ ./bin/instance restart
        
        Install quintagroup.seoptimizer via ZMI portal_setup. Select ``quintagroup.seoptimizer`` from the list of available profiles and press *Import all steps*.
