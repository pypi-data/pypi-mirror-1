long_description = """TGIDProviders is a collection of Identity providers that help you get up and running quickly when you want to validate passwords against an LDAP directory, a UNIX password file, or a SMB provider under Windows.  It takes advantage of TurboGears' entry points (provided by SetupTools) to extend the capabilities of the default identity providers to support other authentication methods.

OpenID is not yet supported, but patches are welcome!
