Description: PyPerforce is a Python package that allows you to connect to a Perforce
        server and execute Perforce commands on that server from Python code.
        
        PyPerforce handles parsing of Perforce forms and results natively, simplifying
        automation of Perforce operations.
        
        PyPerforce has been written with high-performance applications in mind and
        supports executing several commands on a single connection. PyPerforce is both
        thread-safe and thread-friendly and integrates well with asynchronous servers
        using the Twisted framework.
