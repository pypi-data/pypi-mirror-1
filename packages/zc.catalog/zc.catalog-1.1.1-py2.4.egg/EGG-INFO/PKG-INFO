        ==========
        
        zc.catalog is an extension to the Zope 3 catalog, Zope 3's indexing
        and search facility. zc.catalog contains a number of extensions to the
        Zope 3 catalog, such as some new indexes, improved globbing and
        stemming support, and an alternative catalog implementation.

        1.1 (2007-1-6)
        ==============
        
        Features removed
        ----------------
        
        The queueing of events in the extent catalog has been entirely removed.
        Subtransactions caused significant problems to the code introduced in 1.0.
        Other solutions also have significant problems, and the win of this kind
        of queueing is qustionable.  Here is a run down of the approaches rejected
        for getting the queueing to work:
        
        * _p_invalidate (used in 1.0).  Not really designed for use within a
        transaction, and reverts to last savepoint, rather than the beginning of
        the transaction.  Could monkeypatch savepoints to iterate over
        precommit transaction hooks but that just smells too bad.
        
        * _p_resolveConflict.  Requires application software to exist in ZEO and
        even ZRS installations, which is counter to our software deployment goals.
        Also causes useless repeated writes of empty queue to database, but that's
        not the showstopper.
        
        * vague hand-wavy ideas for separate storages or transaction managers for the
        queue.  Never panned out in discussion.
        
        1.0 (2007-1-5)
        ==============
        
        Bugs fixed
        ----------
        
        * adjusted extentcatalog tests to trigger (and discuss and test) the queueing
        behavior.
        
        * fixed problem with excessive conflict errors due to queueing code.
        
        * updated stemming to work with newest version of TextIndexNG's extensions.
        
        * omitted stemming test when TextIndexNG's extensions are unavailable, so
        tests pass without it.  Since TextIndexNG's extensions are optional, this
        seems reasonable.
        
        * removed use of zapi in extentcatalog.
