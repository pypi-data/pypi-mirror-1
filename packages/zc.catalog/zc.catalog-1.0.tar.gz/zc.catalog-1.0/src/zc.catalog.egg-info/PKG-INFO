        ==================
        zc.catalog changes
        ==================
        
        1.0 (2007-1-5)
        ==============
        
        Bugs fixed
        ----------
        
        * adjusted extentcatalog tests to trigger (and discuss and test) the queueing
        behavior.
        
        * fixed problem with excessive conflict errors due to queueing code.
        
        * updated stemming to work with newest version of TextIndexNG's extensions.
        
        * omitted stemming test when TextIndexNG's extensions are unavailable, so
        tests pass without it.  Since TextIndexNG's extensions are optional, this
        seems reasonable.
        
        * removed use of zapi in extentcatalog.

        Features added
        --------------
