==================
zc.catalog changes
==================

1.0 (2007-1-5)
==============

Bugs fixed
----------

* adjusted extentcatalog tests to trigger (and discuss and test) the queueing
  behavior.

* fixed problem with excessive conflict errors due to queueing code.

* updated stemming to work with newest version of TextIndexNG's extensions.

* omitted stemming test when TextIndexNG's extensions are unavailable, so
  tests pass without it.  Since TextIndexNG's extensions are optional, this
  seems reasonable.

* removed use of zapi in extentcatalog.

0.2 (2006-11-22)
================

Features added
--------------

* First release on Cheeseshop.
