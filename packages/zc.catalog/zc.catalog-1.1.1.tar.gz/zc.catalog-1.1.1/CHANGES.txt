==================
zc.catalog changes
==================

1.1.1 (2007-3-17)
=================

Bugs fixed
----------

'all_of' would return all results when one of the values had no results.
Reported, with test and fix provided, by Nando Quintana.

1.1 (2007-1-6)
==============

Features removed
----------------

The queueing of events in the extent catalog has been entirely removed.
Subtransactions caused significant problems to the code introduced in 1.0.
Other solutions also have significant problems, and the win of this kind
of queueing is qustionable.  Here is a run down of the approaches rejected
for getting the queueing to work:

* _p_invalidate (used in 1.0).  Not really designed for use within a
  transaction, and reverts to last savepoint, rather than the beginning of
  the transaction.  Could monkeypatch savepoints to iterate over
  precommit transaction hooks but that just smells too bad.

* _p_resolveConflict.  Requires application software to exist in ZEO and
  even ZRS installations, which is counter to our software deployment goals.
  Also causes useless repeated writes of empty queue to database, but that's
  not the showstopper.

* vague hand-wavy ideas for separate storages or transaction managers for the
  queue.  Never panned out in discussion.

1.0 (2007-1-5)
==============

Bugs fixed
----------

* adjusted extentcatalog tests to trigger (and discuss and test) the queueing
  behavior.

* fixed problem with excessive conflict errors due to queueing code.

* updated stemming to work with newest version of TextIndexNG's extensions.

* omitted stemming test when TextIndexNG's extensions are unavailable, so
  tests pass without it.  Since TextIndexNG's extensions are optional, this
  seems reasonable.

* removed use of zapi in extentcatalog.

0.2 (2006-11-22)
================

Features added
--------------

* First release on Cheeseshop.
