        ===========
        
        hgexternals is a Mercurial extension that simulates in some ways
        Subversion's externals features.
        
        To enable the "hgexternals" extension, either shipped with Mercurial or
        in the Python search path, create an entry for it in your hgrc, like this::
        
        
        [extensions]
        hgexternals =
        
        For help using hgexternals, run: "hg externals --help"
        
        
        hg status hook
        --------------
        
        You can also expand your stat command by adding hook::
        
        
        [hooks]
        post-status = python:hgexternals.extstatushook
        
        It will display externals status similar way Subversion does.
        
        Currently extstatushook does not recognize any option specific to hg stat. It
        should support global options as --repo. It will warn you that option is not
        recognized and wont produce output. Hovever **it does support** nodes on which
        should stat be ran.
        
        .. warning::
        
        From this version EXTERNALS or .hgexternals can be placed **ONLY** in
        repository root.
