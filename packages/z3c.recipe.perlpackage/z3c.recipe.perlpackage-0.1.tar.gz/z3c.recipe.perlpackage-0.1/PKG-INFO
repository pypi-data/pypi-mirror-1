Description: Recipe for installing Perl packages via download
        ************************************************
        
        The perlpackages recipe automates installation of Perl packages.
        
        This recipe is similar to zc.recipe.cmmi, but instead of performing
        "configure, make, make install" it uses "perl Makefile.PL" for the configure
        step.
        
        Options
        -------
        
        url
        Location to download the Perl distribution from.
        
        extra_options
        Additional parameters that are passed to Makefile.PL.
        
        perl
        Name of the Perl interpreter to use for "perl Makefile.PL". Defaults
        to "perl".
        
        flatinstallprefix
        Set the installation prefix, and force all library, doc and bin files to
        be flattened into three install locations:
        
        ${flatinstallprefix}/lib/perl5/
        ${flatinstallprefix}/bin/
        ${flatinstallprefix}/man/
        
        This is suitable for creating a location that you can include in your
        PERL5LIB environment variable.
