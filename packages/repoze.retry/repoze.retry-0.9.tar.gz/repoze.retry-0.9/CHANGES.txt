0.9 (2008-06-15)

 Fixed concurrency bug whereby a response from one request might be
 returned as result of a different request.

 Initial PyPI release.

0.8

 Added WSGI conformance testing for the middleware.

0.7

 Made the retryable exception(s) configurable, removing the hardwired
 dependency on ZODB3.

0.6

 Relaxed requirement for ZODB 3.7.2, since we might need to use
 the package with other verions.

0.5

 Depend on PyPI release of ZODB 3.7.2.  Upgrade to this by doing
 bin/easy_install -U 'ZODB3 >= 3.7.2, < 3.8.0a' if necessary.

0.4

 Write retry attempts to 'wsgi.errors' stream if availabile.

 Depend on rerolled ZODB 3.7.1 instead of zopelib.

 Add license and copyright, change trove classifiers.

0.3

 We now buffer the result of a downstream application's
 'start_response' call so we can retry requests which have already
 called start_response without breaking the WSGI spec (the server's
 start_response may only be called once unless there is an exception,
 and then it needs to be called with an exc_info three-tuple, although
 we're uninterested in that case here).

0.2

 The entry point name was wrong (it referred to "tm").  Change it so
 that egg:repoze.retry#retry should work in paste configs.

 Depend on zopelib rather than ZODB 3.8.0b3 distribution, because the
 ZODB distribution pulls in various packages (zope.interface and ZEO
 most notably) that are incompatible with stock Zope 2.10.4 apps and
 older sandboxes.  We'll need to revisit this.
