Abstract
--------
A Portlet wich displays recent changed items of a custom type.


Introduction
------------
This Portlet behaves in almost the same manner as the standard recent changed
items Portlet. The difference is, that a custom Content Type can be selected so
that only recent changed items of this portal type are displayed.  Also the
"more changes" link is modified that a custum view will be displayed with all
recent changes of exactly this type.
