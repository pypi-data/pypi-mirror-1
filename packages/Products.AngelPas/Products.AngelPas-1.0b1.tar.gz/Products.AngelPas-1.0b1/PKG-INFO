        ========
        
        Description
        -----------
        
        AngelPas integrates ANGEL-dwelling course sections with Plone's user-and-group
        machinery.
        
        Each section gives rise to several groups:
        
        * One for each team, name like "Philosophy 101 Section 1: Team A"
        
        * One of people with the Instructor role within a section: "Philosophy 101
        Section 1: Instructors"
        
        * One of people with the Student role within a section: "Philosophy 101
        Section 1: Students"
        
        * One of people with the Writer role within a section: "Philosophy 101
        Section 1: Writers"
        
        * One named for the section itself, "Philosophy 101 Section 1", which is a
        union of everyone in the above groups.
        
        Groups that have no members are hidden to cut down on noise, since you can't add
        anyone to them through Plone anyway.
        
        The users belonging to the above groups are manifested as Plone users, complete
        with full names if ANGEL provides them. They can be assigned privileges and
        group memberships within Plone using its normal facilities.
        
        For performance reasons, the information fetched from ANGEL is cached for an
        hour. To clear the cache, restart Plone.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Installation is like that of any other PAS plugin. The only gotcha is that
        AngelPas's Properties plugin must come before Plone's mutable_properties plugin.
        
        1. Install AngelPas, for example by dropping it in your *products* folder.
        
        2. In the *acl_users* folder within your Plone site, add an *AngelPas Plugin*.
        
        3. Click the new plugin, and fill out the API username and password, the IDs
        of the course sections to use, etc. Click *Save Changes*.
        
        4. Click the plugin's *Activate* tab, and check all the boxes. Click *Update*.
        
        5. Click the *Activate* tab again, then click the *Propertes* link next to the
        checkbox (not the tab at the top of the screen).
        
        6. Move the AngelPas plugin above the *mutable_properties* plugin. Without
        this step, mutable_properties will obscure ANGEL's provided full names with an
        empty string.
        
        
        Use
        ---
        
        When AngelPas has trouble communicating with the ANGEL server, it logs an error
        at the level ERROR. For example...
        
        ERROR Products.AngelPas ANGEL roster request returned an error: Not
        authenticated
        
        It then allows Plone to continue without presenting an error to the user. This
        at least allows the site to continue functioning at a reduced level while ANGEL
        is unavailable. It is advisable to monitor your logs to catch ANGEL problems
        especially after changing AngelPas settings.
        
        
        Troubleshooting
        ---------------
        
        An error like this...
        
        ERROR Products.AngelPas ANGEL roster request returned an error: Not authenticated
        
        ...can indicate, at Penn State anyway, that your IP address is not allowed to
        access ANGEL. Contact the ANGEL administrators.
