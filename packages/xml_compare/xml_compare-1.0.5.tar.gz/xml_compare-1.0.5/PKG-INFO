Description: The xml_compare library allows to easily test two xml trees if they
        have the same content. This is especially valuable when unit testing
        XML based sistems.
        
        If the trees differ, xml_compare tries to give a good indication on
        the nature and location of difference.
        
        It should work with any etree implementation, but it has been developed
        with lxml.
