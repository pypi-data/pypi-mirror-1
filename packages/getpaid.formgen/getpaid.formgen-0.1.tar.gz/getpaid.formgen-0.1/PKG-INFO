Description: getpaid.formgen Package
        =======================
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        PloneGetPaid♡PloneFormGen
        
        Link PloneFormGen with PloneGetPaid so a form can add items or donations
        to the GetPaid shopping cart.
        
        
        
        Requirements:
        -------------
        To begin with we need a working Plone instance with PloneGetPaid, PloneFormGen
        and DataGridField installed.
        
        Install:
        --------
        There are two ways of installing getpaid.forgen, if you got it as an egg you
        just easy_install it or fetch it with your buildout or else you can copy the
        inner formgen from this folder structure to your instance's
        /lib/python/getpaid.
        After that you will see PloneGetPaid♡PloneFormGen in your plone control
        pannel addon product section (you may see two, install whichever you want,
        they are the same thing).
        After hitting install you are done, now whenever you create a FormGen folder
        you will have as available content types a "GetPaid Adapter" which creates the
        required folders for a GetPaid checkout and allows you to map any GetPaid
        product on the site to a field on your form.
        
        A few remarks:
        --------------
        * If you are using other adapters (such as salesforce one) please make sure to
        edit and save (even without changes) this one last, because it adds a clause
        to all other present adapters so they execute after it, this avoids comitting
        data of an order that can be rejected.
        * Make sure to remove the default mail adapter from the FormgenForm or you
        could end up sending sensible data by mail by accident.

        0.1 (2009-03-13)
        ----------------
        
        - removed the package info that shouldn't be under svn [lucielejard]
        - moved setup.py at the same level as src, and updated the link to files in it,
        - fixed typo (Conutry -> Country) [mcgruff.scruff]
        - explicitly including meta.zcml (uncommitted change from hg tarball)
        - spacing cleanup (uncommitted change from hg tarball)
        - post-migration cleanup. [mcgruff.scruff]
        These files were brought in from a Mercurial tarball (provided by David
        Glick) using Tailor with the following configuration:
        
        ::
        
        [tailor]
        verbose = True
        source = hg:
        target = svn:
        start-revision = 14
        root-directory = ~/Desktop/getpaid.formgen
        encoding = UTF-8
        [hg:tailor]
        repository = ~/Desktop/getpaid.formgen
        [svn:tailor]
        repository = https://getpaid.googlecode.com/svn
        module = getpaid.formgen/trunk/src
        
        - Also, I removed all .pyc files before migration with:
        
        ::
        
        find . -type f -name "*.pyc" -exec rm -f {} \;
        
        - ripped out perrito's unnecessary action adapter blocking PFG already
        handles that if you return an error value
        - misc cleanup: fixed imports, removed pdbs, resuscitated test infrastructure
        - Added remarks about usage
        - pumped some info into the readme file
        - Added support to run other adapters before doing one page checkout
        redirection to thank you page.
