  These files were brought in from a Mercurial tarball (provided by David
  Glick) using Tailor with the following configuration:
  
:: 
 
  [tailor]
  verbose = True
  source = hg:
  target = svn:
  start-revision = 14
  root-directory = ~/Desktop/getpaid.formgen
  encoding = UTF-8
  [hg:tailor]
  repository = ~/Desktop/getpaid.formgen
  [svn:tailor]
  repository = https://getpaid.googlecode.com/svn
  module = getpaid.formgen/trunk/src

- Also, I removed all .pyc files before migration with:

::

  find . -type f -name "*.pyc" -exec rm -f {} \;

- ripped out perrito's unnecessary action adapter blocking PFG already
  handles that if you return an error value
- misc cleanup: fixed imports, removed pdbs, resuscitated test infrastructure
- Added remarks about usage
- pumped some info into the readme file
- Added support to run other adapters before doing one page checkout 
  redirection to thank you page.
