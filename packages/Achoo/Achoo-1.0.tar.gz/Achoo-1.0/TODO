 * Add assertion methods to ValueAssertionBuilder for all Python ops
   and emulatable methods.

 * Add a "then()" or similar method to the builders to allow a method
   to be called many times, or allow returning to the original builder
   after using index(), etc.

 * Allow custom builders to be provided? Maybe?

 * Add translation infrastruture, find translations.

 * Other stuff...?
