Description: Overview
        --------
        
        The z3c.pt package provides an alternative implementation of the TAL
        template language including i18n. It also provides a simple text
        template class that allows expression interpolation.
        
        Casual benchmarks pegs it 10x more performant than ``zope.pagetemplate``.
        
        In a nutshell:
        
        * Templates are bytecode-compiled
        * Pluggable expression implementation
        * Support for expression interpolation using the ${<expression>}-format
        * Non-XML friendly
        
        Note: The METAL macro language is not supported.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        See README.txt inside package for general usage; to register the
        default expression types, load the package component configuration
        file (configure.zcml).
        
        
        Template and expression language
        --------------------------------
        
        The template and expression language is based loosely on the TAL 1.4
        specification*. Some notable changes:
        
        1. Tuples are allowed in the tal:define statement:
        
        tal:define="(a, b, c) [1, 2, 3]"
        
        2. Generators are allowed in tal:repeat statements. Note that the
        repeat variable is not available in this case.
        
        tal:repeat="i <some generator>"
        
        3. Attribute-access to dictionary entries is allowed in
        Python-expressions, e.g.
        
        dictionary.key
        
        can be used instead of ``dictionary['key']``.
        
        4. Expression interpolation is allowed in attributes and HTML content.
        
        <a href="mailto:${context.email}">${context.email}</a>
        
        5. Default expression type can be set using ``tal:default-expression``.
        This is an alternative to providing the expression type before each
        expression.

        Development
        -----------
        
        If you want to use the code directly from trunk (recommended only for
        development and testing usage), provide ``z3c.pt==dev`` as your
        dependency.

        Changelog
        ---------
        
        Version 0.8.x
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Made sure the traceback from the *first* template exception
        is carried over to __traceback_info__
        
        - Added template source annotations on exceptions raised while
        rendering a template.
        
        Version 0.8 - March 19, 2008
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Added support for 'nocall' and 'not' (for path-expressions).
        
        - Added support for path- and string-expressions.
        
        - Abstracted expression translation engine. Expression implementations
        are now pluggable. Expression name pragmas are supported throughout.
        
        - Formalized expression types
        
        - Added support for 'structure'-keyword for replace and content.
        
        - Result of 'replace' and 'content' is now escaped by default.
        
        - Benchmark is now built as a custom testrunner
        
        Version 0.7 - March 10, 2008
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Added support for comments; expressions are allowed
