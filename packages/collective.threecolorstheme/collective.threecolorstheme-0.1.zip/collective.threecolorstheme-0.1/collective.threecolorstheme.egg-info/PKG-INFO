        I. Introduction
        ===============
        
        A collective phantasy dynamic theme.
        Based on three colors.
        
        II. Installation
        ================
        
        Read docs/INSTALL.txt to install this package in your zope instance
        using buildout or easy_install (read it carefully ! there's an overrides
        section)
        
        In your Plone site > ZMI > portal_quickinstaller
        
        Choose "Three Colors Theme" product, and click on Install
        This will install the plone product and all dependencies
        (collective.phantasy and SmartColorWidget)
        
        III. Usage
        ==========
        
        1. Change skin for the portal :
        -------------------------------
        
        - Go to your plone site > dynamic-root-skin
        
        - click on edit
        
        - change the 3 colors,
        
        - change the dimensions and other fields values
        
        - set filenames for some fields
        
        - load your custom css or images inside the skin
        using "Import Files" form (post a zip with all your files)
        or using PloneFlashUpload (a powerful Plone product)
        
        - take care of filenames inside the skin
        (they must be the same as names inside the skin edit form, perhaps you will need to change
        the values because Plone has changed them for valid ids).
        
        2. change a skin for a folder :
        -------------------------------
        
        - Go to your plone site > folder-skins-repository
        
        - Add a new phantasy skin inside the skins repository
        
        - In this new skin you will get the same values as set in dynamic-root-skin
        
        - Change it (do the same thing as you've done in $1)
        
        - Go to any folder on your site for which you want another skin
        
        - Click on "edit" tab
        
        - A "phantasy-skin" field is available
        so you can browse the portal to choose another skin for your folder.
        
        - Note that the folder get the two css (from the root skin and from the folder skin)
        
        
        3. Create a new skin with Samples provided in this product
        ----------------------------------------------------------
        
        - Add a new dynamic skin (see $1 & $2)
        
        - Click on import images and files
        
        - Inside the folder alternate_skin, choose the archive alternate_skin.zip click on Import
        
        - Read howtouseit.txt (to set values according to new images)
        
        - There is another example inside ornicart_skin Folder
        
        
        
        
        
        
        collective.threecolorstheme Installation
        ========================================
        
        To install collective.threecolorstheme into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
        using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:
        
        * When you're reading this you have probably already run
        ``easy_install collective.threecolorstheme``. Find out how to install setuptools
        (and EasyInstall) here:
        http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall
        
        * If you are using Zope 2.9 (not 2.10), get `pythonproducts`_ and install it
        via::
        
        python setup.py install --home /path/to/instance
        
        into your Zope instance.
        
        * Create a file called ``collective.threecolorstheme-configure.zcml`` in the
        ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
        should only contain this::
        
        <include package="collective.threecolorstheme" />
        
        * Create a file called ``collective.threecolorstheme-overrides.zcml`` in the
        ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
        should only contain this::
        
        <include package="collective.threecolorstheme" file="overrides.zcml" />
        
        .. _pythonproducts: http://plone.org/products/pythonproducts
        
        
        Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
        recipe to manage your project, you can do this:
        
        * Add ``collective.threecolorstheme`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:
        
        [buildout]
        ...
        eggs =
        ...
        collective.threecolorstheme
        
        * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug:
        
        [instance]
        recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
        ...
        zcml =
        collective.threecolorstheme
        collective.threecolorstheme-overrides
        
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with:
        
        $ ./bin/buildout
        
        You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
        from another package's configure.zcml file.
