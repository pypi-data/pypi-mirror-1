        This package contains tools for working with DC Workflow definitions via
        spreadsheets (or rather, CSV format) as well as debugging aids to make it
        easier to work with security and workflow in Zope 2 and Plone.
        
        It consists of:
        
        - A GenericSetup exporter that can dump a workflow definition to a CSV file
        - A GenericSetup importer that can create a workflow definition from a CSV
        file
        - An in-browser tool to sanity-check a workflow
        - A browser view to dump a workflow in the site to CSV as a one-off
        - A browser view to show the roles of a user in a given context
        
        CSV import/export
        -----------------
        
        Please note that the CSV format is not completely equivalent to the standard
        XML-based GenericSetup format to import/export workflow definitions. If you
        require the full power of DCWorkflow, you should continue to use the XML
        based format. This is not (just) due to laziness - the CSV format has been
        simplified to make common operations easy.
        
        For an example CSV file, see
        
        collective/wtf/tests/profiles/testing/test_wf.csv.
        
        To be imported as part of a GenericSetup extension profile, a file like this
        would normally go in
        
        profiles/default/workflow_csv/wf_name.csv
        
        where wf_name is the name of the workflow in portal_workflow.
        
        Note that if a full workflow definition does exist (e.g. in
        profiles/default/workflows/my_workflow/definition.xml), the CSV importer will
        *not* attempt to run an import, so as not to conflict or overwrite changes.
        
        To download a workflow definition in CSV format as a one-off, type a URL like
        this into your browser:
        
        http://localhost:8080/Plone/portal_workflow/my_workflow/@@to-csv
        
        Here, "Plone" is the name of the Plone instance and "my_workflow" is the name
        of your workflow definition. You will be asked to download a CSV file.
        
        Workflow sanity checker
        -----------------------
        
        To invoke the sanity checker, type a URL like this into your browser:
        
        http://localhost:8080/Plone/portal_workflow/my_workflow/@@sanity-check
        
        Again, "Plone" is the name of the Plone instance and "my_workflow" is the name
        of the workflow definition. The output will be written to the browser window
        in plain text.
        
        Other debugging aids
        --------------------
        
        To view the current roles of a given user in a given context, type a URL like
        this into your browser when logged in as a Manager user:
        
        http://localhost:8080/Plone/context/@@display-roles-in-context?user=<user>
        
        Again, "Plone" is the name of the Plone instance. "context" could be any
        object. <user> should be replaced by the login name/id of the user you
        want to fetch roles for. The output will be written to the browser window in
        plain text.
