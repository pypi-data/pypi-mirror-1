        This package contains tools for working with DC Workflow definitions via
        spreadsheets (or rather, CSV format).
        
        It consists of:
        
        - A GenericSetup exporter that can dump a workflow definition to a CSV file
        - A GenericSetup importer that can create a workflow definition from a CSV
        file
        - An in-browser tool to sanity-check a workflow
        
        Note that the CSV format is not completely equivalent to the standard
        XML-based GenericSetup format to import/export workflow definitions. If you
        require the full power of DCWorkflow, you should continue to use the XML
        based format. This is not (just) due to laziness - the CSV format has been
        simplified to make common operations easy.
        
        For an example CSV file, see
        
        collective/wtf/tests/profiles/testing/test_wf.csv.
        
        A file like this would normally go in
        
        profiles/default/workflow_csv/wf_name.csv
        
        where wf_name is the name of the workflow in portal_workflow. Note that you still need at least a workflows.xml to initialise the workflow definition.
        
        Also note that if a full workflow definition does exist (e.g. in
        profiles/default/workflows/my_workflow/definition.xml), the CSV importer will
        *not* attempt to run an import, so as not to conflict or overwrite changes.
        
        To invoke the sanity checker, type a URL like this into your browser:
        
        http://localhost:8080/Plone/portal_workflow/my_workflow/@@sanity-check
        
        Here, "Plone" is the name of the Plone instance and "my_workflow" is the name
        of your workflow definition. The output will be written to the browser window
        in plain text.
