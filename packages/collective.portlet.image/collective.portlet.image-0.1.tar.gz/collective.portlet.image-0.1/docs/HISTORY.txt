collective.portlet.image - 0.1 Unreleased


Implementing a traversal adapter to get the src of the portlet image based on the approach used in the collective.portlet.feedmixer
    Though one odd problem is left out: how to get the src constructed for non logged in users ?
    For now the src of the image looks like this:
    <site>/++contextportlets++plone.rightcolumn/image-portlet/edit/@@file/image/<image name with extension>
     [pelle_]

Continued r58358 - collective.namedfile is used instead of p4a.fileimage
     [pelle_]

More adjustments trying to use the p4a.fileimage 
     [pelle_]

Initial package structure.
