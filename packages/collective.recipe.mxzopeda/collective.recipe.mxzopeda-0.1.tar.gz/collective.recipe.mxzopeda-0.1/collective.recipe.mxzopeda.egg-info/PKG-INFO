Description: This is a buildout recipe to install eGenix mxODBC.ZopeDA and a licence.
        
        The recipe is largely based on  collective.recipe.mxodbc, a recipe creatd by
        Jarn to installed eGenix mxODBC. That recipe will install mxODBC 3.0 and also
        build an mx.base package from source.
        
        You can add this recipe to your buildout by adding a section like this::
        
        [mxzopeda]
        recipe = collective.recipe.mxzopeda
        license-key = puty-ourl-icen-seco-dehe-repl-ease
        licsenses-archive = mxzopeda-licenses.zip
        
        The licenses archive should be a zip file with one directory for every license
        you want to use with the license key as file name and the license file you
        got from eGenix for that code in the directory.
        
        The recipe tries to detect the correct platform to download the prebuilt
        archive for, but has so far only been verified on Apple OS X universal systems
        and Ubuntu server 8.10 for i686. Please report any problems if you encounter
        problems with other architectures.

        for the mxodbc ZopeDA package from the eGenix site.
        
        - removed mx base as it is included in the prebuilt package.
