Description: ======
        Mortar
        ======
        
        Mortar will be an environment that insulates the application developer
        from the implementation details of storage, retrieval and searching of
        content.
        
        This will allow applications to be developed in one environment, say
        on a simple local Python+SQLite setup, and then deploy to another
        environment, say Google App Engine or a clustered array of Amazon EC2
        instances, with no changes to application code.
        
        This architecture should also provide a seamless environment for
        application developers to work with a disparate array of data sources.
        
        A secondary aim is to allow DBAs and system administrators to optimise
        the performance of applications without modifying any application
        code.
        
        However, for now, it is in the very early stages of development and
        should probably be avoided unless you simply want to see how it's
        shaping up or you want to actively participate in development.
