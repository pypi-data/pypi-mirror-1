Version 0.5.3 (2008-06-07)
-----------------------------

- A test dependency (zope.app.session) was missing
  (still checking with KGS 3.4)

Version 0.5.2 (2008-04-11)
--------------------------

- Simplify ftesting setup, removed duplicated configuration. Make it better
  reusable. Now we can include app.zcml and mixin ftesting.zcml at the same
  time in plugin tests.

Version 0.5.1 (2008-04-13)
--------------------------

- Added new plugin layer for zamplugin.contents plugin

Version 0.5.0 (2008-04-11)
--------------------------

- Now plugin provides it's own management form. By default the PluginManagement
  page can be used which is a mixin of IContentProvider and IForm. This makes
  it possible to write intelligent plugin management views which can do more
  then just install and uninstall.

- Initial Release
