Series Expansions
=================

.. module:: sympy.series

The series module implements series expansions as a function. This is achieved 
by creating a wrapper around Basic.series(). This allows for the use of 
series(x*cos(x),x), which is possibly more intuative than (x*cos(x)).series(x).

Examples
--------
    >>> from sympy import Symbol, cos, series
    >>> x = Symbol('x')
    >>> series(cos(x),x)
    1 - x**2/2 + x**4/24 + O(x**6)


TODO and Bugs
-------------
The series expansion about a point other than x=0 does not work. This is a bug in Basic.series() (issue 1334). When fixed there, the bug will 
also be automatically fixed here.
