Financial and Infrastructure Support
------------------------------------

* `Google <http://www.google.com/corporate/>`_: SymPy has received generous financial support from Google in 2007 by financing 5 students through the Google Summer of Code (GSOC 2007) program (`more info <http://code.google.com/p/sympy/wiki/GSoC2007>`_).

* `Python Software Foundation <http://www.python.org/psf/>`_: PSF hosted 3 GSoC 2007 students (Brian, Robert and Jason)

* `the Space Telescope Science Institute <http://www.stsci.edu/>`_: STScI hosted 1 GSoC 2007 student (Mateusz)

* `Portland State University <http://www.pdx.edu/>`_: PSU hosted 1 GSoC 2007 student (Chris)

* `Simula Research Laboratory <http://www.simula.no/>`_: supports Pearu Peterson work in SymPy/Sympy Core projects
