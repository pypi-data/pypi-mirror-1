SymPy Reference
===============

Because every feature of SymPy must have a test case, when you are not sure how
to use something, just look into the ``tests/`` directories, find that feature
and read the tests for it, that will tell you everything you need to know.

API documentation
-----------------

This documents all SymPy modules and it is automatically generated from SymPy
sources.

Click the  "modules" (:ref:`modindex`) link in the top right corner for
automatically generated documentation.

There is also the `API <http://sympy.googlecode.com/svn/api/sympy.html>`_
documentation generated using pydoctor.

Modules User's Guide
--------------------

Besides the automatically generated documentation, we also have hand written
user's guide and show cases for a lot of modules in SymPy:

.. include:: modules-list.txt

Contributions to docs
---------------------

All contributions are welcome. If you'd like to improve something, look into
the sources if they contain the information you need (if not, please fix them),
otherwise the conversion tool needs to be improved (look in the ``doc/``
directory) to properly extract all interesting information from the sources.
