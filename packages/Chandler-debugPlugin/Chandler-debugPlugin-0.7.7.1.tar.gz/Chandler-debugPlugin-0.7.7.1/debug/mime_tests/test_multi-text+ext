A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the MBONE Deployment Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Multicast-Friendly Internet Exchange (MIX)
	Author(s)	: H. LaMaster, S. Shultz, J. Meylor, D. Meyer
	Filename	: draft-ietf-mboned-mix-00.txt
	Pages		: 9
	Date		: 17-Dec-98
	
    This document describes an architecture for a Multicast-friendly
    Internet eXchange (MIX), and the actual implementation at the NASA
    Ames Research Center Federal Internet eXchange (FIX-West, or FIX).
    The MIX has three objectives: native IP multicast routing, scalable
    interdomain policy-based route exchange, and to allow a variety of
    IGP protocols and topologies for intra-domain use. In support of
    these objectives, the MIX architecture defines the following
    components: a peer-peer routing protocol, a method for multicast
    forwarding, a method for exchanging information about active sources,
    and a medium which provides native multicast.  This document
    describes the protocols and configurations necessary to provide a
    current, working multicast-friendly internet exchange, or MIX.
 
    This memo is a product of the MBONE Deployment Working Group (MBONED)
    in the Operations and Management Area of the Internet Engineering
    Task Force. Submit comments to <mboned@ns.uoregon.edu or the
    authors.

Send a message to:	mailserv@ietf.org.  In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-mboned-mix-00.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
