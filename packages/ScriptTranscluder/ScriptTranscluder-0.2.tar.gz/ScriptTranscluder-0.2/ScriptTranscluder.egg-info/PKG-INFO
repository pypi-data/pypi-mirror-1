Description: Script Transcluder
        ==================
        
        This simple script lets people include bits of your content (hosted on
        whatever server you like) into their own pages.  It uses the age-old
        technique used by ads of issuing writes from a Javascript file.
        
        If you mount this at ``http://example.com/includer.js`` then you can
        use tags like::
        
        <script
        src="http://example.com/includer.js?url=encoded-url"></script>
        
        <script
        src="http://example.com/includer.js?url=encoded-url%23fragment"></script>
        
        <script
        src="http://example.com/includer.js?url=encoded-url&dest=otherId"></script>
        
        These each include the content from the ``encoded-url``.  If you give
        a fragment, it grabs just the bit of identified text.  If you don't,
        it'll take all the text in the ``<body>`` of the page.
        
        It will put the output exactly where the ``<script>`` tag is in the
        page.  If you want to put it someplace else, ``&dest=id`` will put it
        in the element with the given id.  In that case it adds a little
        onload(-like) handler, and then sets the ``innerHTML`` of element with
        that id.  If you can't fetch the url, then it will put a small error
        message into the page in its place.
        
        By default it restricts urls based on the opt-in wildcards of the
        ``allowed_urls`` setting.  You can use ``allowed_urls = *`` to allow
        anything, but this is not recommended.  You can also use ``same_host =
        true`` to allow requests to the same host as where the includer is hosted.
        
        To minimize backend traffic, set ``cache_dir`` to a location to save
        the requested pages.  All the caching is handled by `httplib2
        <http://bitworking.org/projects/httplib2/ref/module-httplib2.html>`_.
        
        Example
        ~~~~~~~
        
        To run an example, install the package and use ``paster serve
        development.ini`` (``development.ini`` is in the tarball).  This will
        start up a server on ``http://localhost:8080/`` where you can view an
        example.

        * In some cases extra ``<body>`` tags would be included in the transcluded
        content (when that tag should never be present).
