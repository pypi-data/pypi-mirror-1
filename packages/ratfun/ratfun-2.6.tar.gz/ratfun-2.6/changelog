2.6 Bugfix Release - Mar 14, 2009

Update the included clnum package.


2.5 Bugfix Release - Oct 18, 2008

Update the included clnum package.


2.4 Enhancement Release - Nov 19, 2006

* Update the included clnum package.

* Added uniqueRoots to handle polynomials with multiple roots.


2.3 Enhancement Release - Aug 18, 2006

* Update the included clnum package.

* Improved the formatting of the string representation of a polynomial.

* Polynomial and rational function evaluation now works with array inputs.


2.2 Enhancement Release - May 6, 2006

* Update the included clnum package.

* Include documentation for building clnum on Windows.


2.1 Enhancement Release - Sep 10, 2005

* Enhanced the polynomial root finder so that it performs better on
  ill-conditioned polynomials.


2.0 Enhancement Release - Aug 18, 2005

* Added function to compute the roots of a polynomial.

* Added clnum package which provides arbitrary precision floats and rationals
  in both real and complex forms.  Also provides the functions in the standard
  math and cmath libraries in extended precision floating point.

* Switched ratfun so that it requires the clnum package.  This simplified some
  of the code for handling integer coefficients.  It also makes it possible to
  use Laguerre's method for finding the roots of polynomials.

* Changed the license to the GPL because the clnum package uses a GPL library.
