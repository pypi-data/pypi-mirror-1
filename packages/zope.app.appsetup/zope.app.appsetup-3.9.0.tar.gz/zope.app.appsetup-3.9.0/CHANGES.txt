Version 3.9.0 (2009-01-31)
--------------------------

- Use ``zope.site`` instead of ``zope.app.folder`` and
  ``zope.app.component``.

- Use ``zope.container`` instead of ``zope.app.container``.

- Move error log bootstrapping logic from ``zope.error`` into this
  package.  This removes a dependency from zope.error to this
  package. Also added a test for bootstrapping the error log here,
  which was missing in ``zope.error``.


Version 3.8.0 (2008-08-25)
--------------------------

- Feature: Developed an entry point that allows you to quickly bring up an
  application instance for debugging purposes. (Implemented by Marius Gedminas
  and Stephan Richter.)


Version 3.7.0 (2008-08-19)
--------------------------

- Added ``.product.loadConfiguration`` test-support function; loads product
  configuration (only) from a file object, allowing test code (including
  setup) to make use of the same configuration schema support used by normal
  startup.


Version 3.6.0 (2008-07-23)
--------------------------

- Added additional test support functions to set the configuration for a
  single section, and save/restore the entire configuration.


Version 3.5.0 (2008-06-17)
--------------------------

- Added helper class for supporting product configuration tests.
