Servable
http://servable.appspot.com/

--== Introduction ==--

Servable is a clean way to write a little webservice. Just subclass Servable, create your class, and transmute it
into a webservice with the Servable-inherited "wsgi_app" method. Plug that method into your favorite webserver, and go.
If you don't have a favorite webserver, you can call "run_test_server" on your Servable-derived class. That'll do in a pinch.
