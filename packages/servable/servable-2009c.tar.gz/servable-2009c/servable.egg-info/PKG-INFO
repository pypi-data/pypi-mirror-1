Summary: Webservice mixin. Just subclass Servable, create your class, and transmute it into a webservice with the Servable-inherited 'wsgi_app' method. Plug that method into your favorite webserver, and go. If you don't have a favorite webserver, you can call 'run_test_server' on your Servable-derived class. That'll do in a pinch.
