Description: 
        ZicBee is a project grouping multiple applications to manage play and handle music databases.
        It takes ideas from Quodlibet and Mpd, both very good music mplayers with their own strengths.
        
        For now there is a Swiss-army knife tool: zicdb
        
        Some plugins for quodlibet has also be developed. ZicBee is fast,
        portable (but not very ported...) and flexible.
        
        While the project is stable and usable (there are online docs and a nice www gui),
        it's mostly interesting for hackers and developers from now, I didn't confront to real users yet :P
        
        See features list, it's mostly handy for people with large databases,
        with optionally multiple computers.
        It can be adapted to handle video too, hacking some bit of code.
