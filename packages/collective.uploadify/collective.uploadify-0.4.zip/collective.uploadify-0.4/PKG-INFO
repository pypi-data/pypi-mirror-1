        collective.uploadify Installation
        *********************************
        
        To install collective.uploadify into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
        using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:
        
        * When you're reading this you have probably already run
        ``easy_install collective.uploadify``. Find out how to install setuptools
        (and EasyInstall) here:
        http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall
        
        * If you are using Zope 2.9 (not 2.10), get `pythonproducts`_ and install it
        via::
        
        python setup.py install --home /path/to/instance
        
        into your Zope instance.
        
        * Create a file called ``collective.uploadify-configure.zcml`` in the
        ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
        should only contain this::
        
        <include package="collective.uploadify" />
        
        .. _pythonproducts: http://plone.org/products/pythonproducts
        
        
        Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
        recipe to manage your project, you can do this:
        
        * Add ``collective.uploadify`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
        
        [buildout]
        ...
        eggs =
        ...
        collective.uploadify
        
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with:
        
        $ ./bin/buildout
