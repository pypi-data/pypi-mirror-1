plone.app.controlpanel - 1.0b5 Released May 5, 2007

    - Fixed dummy on_save method to accept the data argument.
      [hannosch]

plone.app.controlpanel - 1.0b4 Released May 5, 2007

    - Pass data to the on-save template method.
      [optilude]

    - Add a callback method from the save button handler. This makes it easier
      to react when saving is finished (successfully) - otherwise, the schema
      adapter properties are simple set one-by-one and you can't do anything
      when form saving is complete. The alternative is to override the button
      handler, but then we lose some of the consistency that plone.app.form
      tries to introduce.
      [optilude]

    - Wording.
      [limi]

plone.app.controlpanel - 1.0b3 Released May 1, 2007
