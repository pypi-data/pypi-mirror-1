plone.app.controlpanel - 1.0 Released August 14, 2007

    - If we are looking at settings for the default workflow lookup the
      real workflow. This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6843
      (yes, that bug again).

      panels. This refs http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6911.
      [hannosch]

    - The UI allowed to disable country-specific language variants even if
      one was still active as the default language. You get a nice error
      message now. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6862.
      [hannosch]

    - Use checkboxes instead of a evil MultiSelect for the wiki settings.
      This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6872 for real.
      [hannosch]

    - Internationalized the workflow part of the types control panel. All
      descriptions, states and titles should be translated now.
      [hannosch]

    - Fixed order of types in the dropdown. We sort by translated title now.
      [hannosch]

    - When updating the default workflow do not reset the workflow for types
      using the default workflow to the new default workflow. This fixes
      the last part of http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6843.
      [wichert]

    - Handle changing the workflow from a type to the default workflow if the
      default workflow is the same as the previous workflow correctly. This
      fixes part of http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6843.
      [wichert]

    - When we remap the default workflow change the default workflow in
      the workflow tool as well. This fixes part of
      http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6843.
      [wichert]

    - Remapping the "(Default)" workflow to No Workflow didn't work.
      Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6818.
      [optilude]

    - Remapping to "No Workflow" resulted in an error, fixed. Thanks to
      rsantos for the patch. Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6819.
      [limi]

    - Made column checkbox widget easily subclassable for being able to use it
      with different amount of columns from other packages.
      [davconvent]

plone.app.controlpanel - 1.0rc3 Released July 28, 2007

    - Fixed missing history entries.
      [hannosch]

plone.app.controlpanel - 1.0rc2 Released July 27, 2007

    - Add a description to the no-workflow fallback. This fixes
      http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6812.
      [wichert]

    - Filter control panel doesn't warn you when you haven't saved your changes
      Added enableUnloadFormProtection class to the control panel form.
      This references http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6654.
      [duncan]

    - Removed lots of irrelevant options from the language control panel. The
      selection of the default language could use a simpler widget, but it's
      too late to change that now. All advanced options should be made
      available through control panels in add-ons which actually use these
      settings. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6784.
      [hannosch]

    - Fixed various bugs in the LanguageTableWidget. Removed broken code that
      tried to show the country flags. Showing 150 flags is rather excessive.
      This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6814.
      [hannosch]

    - Removed multilingual content settings from the language control panel.
      These don't have any effect in a standard Plone site. LinguaPlone /
      plone.app.multilingual features its own control panel.
      [hannosch]

plone.app.controlpanel - 1.0rc1 Released July 9, 2007

    - Do not show really user unfriendly types anymore in the search and types
      control panels. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6292.
      [hannosch]

    - Consistently bicapitalized 'JavaScript'. This refs
      http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6636.
      [hannosch]

    - Fixed another spelling error on the filter control panel. This closes
      http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6653.
      [hannosch]

    - Fixed two spelling errors on the filter control panel. This closes
      http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6644.
      [hannosch]

    - Added and used the new LanguageTableWidget for the available language
      listing.
      [hannosch]

    - Use the new LanguageDropdownChoiceWidget for the default language field.
      [hannosch]

    - Added first working version of the new language control panel. It still
      needs two new locale aware widgets for the language listings. This refs
      http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5442.
      [hannosch]

    - Added support for optional descriptions on fieldsets.
      [hannosch]

    - Added RAMCache control panel. You can invoke it via
      http://portal/@@ramcache-controlpanel.
      [hannosch]

    - Localized the calendar control panel weekday names based on the Zope 3
      locales information, which is available from the portal_state view.
      [hannosch]

    - Removed title customization from the types control panel. This is
      currently not possible in any i18n-safe way. This closes
      http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6551.
      [hannosch]

plone.app.controlpanel - 1.0b5 Released May 5, 2007

    - Fixed dummy on_save method to accept the data argument.
      [hannosch]

plone.app.controlpanel - 1.0b4 Released May 5, 2007

    - Pass data to the on-save template method.
      [optilude]

    - Add a callback method from the save button handler. This makes it easier
      to react when saving is finished (successfully) - otherwise, the schema
      adapter properties are simple set one-by-one and you can't do anything
      when form saving is complete. The alternative is to override the button
      handler, but then we lose some of the consistency that plone.app.form
      tries to introduce.
      [optilude]

    - Wording.
      [limi]

plone.app.controlpanel - 1.0b3 Released May 1, 2007

    - Adjusted the mail control panel to store the email settings on the portal
      root intead of in the site properties. This closes
      http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6173.
