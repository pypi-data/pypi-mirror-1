Description: dict_compare compares two python dictionaries and reports on any
        differences between them.
        
        This can be very handy when comparing dictionary structures. Typical
        use case is comparing expected and received values in a unittest.
        
        New in 1.0.2:
        
        - Support for output in Diff format for dictionary differences.
