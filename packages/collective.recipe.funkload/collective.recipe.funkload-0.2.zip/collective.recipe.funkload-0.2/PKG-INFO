Description: 
        collective.recipe.funkload is a nice and simple recipe that allows easy running of funkload tests and generation of reports on them,
        running ./bin/funkload bench will run all the funkload tests within the buildout and then autogenerate the html reports for them.
        Report generation requires gnuplot, currently there is no way to cleanly disable this.  The reports and supporting xml is stored in
        the path pointed to by location in your part (defaults to ./var/funkload).  You may also have the reports generated in a different directory
        using report_destination.
        
        
        Example usage
        =============
        
        In order for this to work its magic you need to set a base URL for the tests
        to be run on, your buildout part will look something like this:
        
        >>> write('buildout.cfg',
        ... """
        ... [buildout]
        ... parts = test1
        ... index = http://pypi.python.org/simple
        ... [test1]
        ... recipe = collective.funkload
        ... url = 127.0.0.1:8080
        ... """)
        
        
        Running that buildout gives us the ``funkload`` script:
        
        >>> print 'start\n', system(buildout)
        start
        ...
        Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/funkload'.
        
        Which passes the host through to the subcommand handler in the recipe:
        
        >>> import os
        >>> script = os.path.join(sample_buildout,'bin','funkload')
        >>> print open(script,'r').read()
        #!...url="127.0.0.1:8080"...
        
        If you don't specify a URL buildout will fail:
        
        >>> write('buildout.cfg',
        ... """
        ... [buildout]
        ... parts = test1
        ... index = http://pypi.python.org/simple
        ... [test1]
        ... recipe = collective.funkload
        ... """)
        
        >>> print 'start\n', system(buildout)
        start
        ...
        KeyError: 'You must specify an url to test'
