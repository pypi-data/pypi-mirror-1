Editra is made possible by the following "free" technologies and
the communities that develop them.

Python Programming Language (http://www.python.org)
wxPython Class Library (http://www.wxpython.org)
setuptools (http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools)
py2app (http://undefined.org/python/#py2app)
py2exe (http://py2exe.org) 

The bulk of the icons that are distributed in the default Editra icon theme
'Nuovo' are derived from the excellent Dropline Nuovo! icon set.
