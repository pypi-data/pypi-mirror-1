Changes since last release:

VERSION 0.1.64
DATE 07/27/2007
4th Alpha Release

NEWS:
Thanks to everyone who reported errors and problems in the last release I was
able to tie up a number loose ends and error cases in the programs operation.

Major changes to profile system, the view of the the profile should not be much
different from the perspective of usage but the underlying system has been
completely rewritten to be more robust, reliable, and scalable. These changes
have made the Pyshell-v0.2 and FileBrowser-v0.1 incompatible with this new
version of Editra, however there are also new versions of both these plugins
that are compatible and bundled with the binary versions.

Some changes to the style sheet system have been made that make older syntax
style sheets incompatible with this version. If you are just using the builtin
styles there is no need to worry about this but if you have created a custom
style sheet you will need to change the font face definitions not to use the 
following format expressions (%(mono), %(helv), %(other), %(times)), and
instead use the new tags of (%(primary), %(secondary)) these expressions are
to ensure that the fonts that are set as the preferred fonts in the preference
dialog are used instead of the defaults when applicable.

NEW: [features/improvements]
+Improved notebook tab navigation
+Better Drag and Drop feedback for text and files
+Font preferences can be saved from session to session
+New User Profile system
+FileBrowser plugin is now bundled with Editra binary distrobutions
+Commandline option to enable debugging
+Error reporter can be disabled in the preference dialog

BUG FIXES:
+Handled some unhandled error conditions in the python autocompleter
+Fixed a bug where a save would fail when clicking on Yes when the modify save
 dialog was shown.
+Fixed a number of minor bugs in the plugin manager
+Fixed bug in the Preferences Dialog where some settings wouldn't get set
+Filehistory order is properly preserved
+Fixed a bug in the Style Editor where it would occasionally prompt for saving 
 when it didn't need to.
+Style Editor and Plugin Manager now properly use Metal style when it is set on
 OSX.
+Fixed a bug where the Find dialogs menu entries would get disabled after the
 first showing.

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------#

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------#
VERSION 0.1.0
DATE 05/24/2007
1st Alpha Release

NEWS:
  This is the first release in the alpha release series. The alpha releases will
probably continue until version 0.5.0 or so when the beta phase begins and 
most development energy will be shifted to stabilization of the editor and the 
api as well as improving performance to prepare for a 1.0 release. What can be 
expected during this alpha release series is the improvement of current features, 
a few new minor features and more thorough testing prior to a release which will 
lead to a more powerful, more stable and more usable program.

  The big addition to this version is the support for extensions to the editor
through plugins written in python. The plugins must be written and packaged
in a certain way for them to work, but the api is fairly easy to learn and
even easier to use. To learn more visit the documentation page at read the
plugins how to in the user documentation section. This version of the editor
comes with one plugin that can be used as an example of how to do things
as well.

  There is now a platform independent installer for Editra. It will install
Editra as a python package. To install Editra as a python package just issue
the following command from the command line in the source package base 
directory.

        python setup.py install

   This is of course assuming that python is on your path. On Windows you
may have to issue the command as follows. Where the XX is replaced with
the version number of python you have installed (i.e 24, 25, ect...)

        C:\\PythonXX\python.exe setup.py install

   This installation method is in its first iteration and probably has some 
compatibility issues, so please report bugs either on the bug tracker 
(code.google.com/issues/list) or on the community page (editra.org/?page=community)
to help improve it.

NEW: [features/improvements]
+Extensibility through plugins written in python
+PyShell Plugin
+Source package build/install script (OS Independent Installer)
+Some minor improvements to the Windows Installer
+Improved OS X integration/behavior of applet

DATE 04/10/2007
15th Snapshot Release

NEWS:
   Major bug fix for keybindings on Windows. Cut/Copy/Paste/Undo/Redo/Select
All where aparently not working. This has probably been the case since version

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------#
VERSION 0.0.96
DATE 04/05/2007
14th Snapshot Release

NEWS:
    Included in this version is an experimental implimentation of an
autocompletion/calltip provider for python documents. It is capable of looking
up and providing autompletion lists and calltips for top level defined objects
only. For example this means that if you have imported the wx namespace into
the document with a statement like this.

        import wx

You will be able to get autocompletion/calltip help for anything in the wx
namespace. (i.e if you type 'wx.' into the editor a list of possible items from
the wx namespace will be provided). But this support does not extend to locally
created objects in your file.

        class MyFrame(wx.Frame):
        ...

If this class is defined in the current working file its namespace is unable to be
looked up under the current model. Meaning that if you type 'MyFrame.' you will
not recieve a list of autocomplete options for the MyFrame class or its parent
wx.Frame class). This limitiation is being imposed on purpose currently do
to some rather unpleasant issues that arise from time to time as well as some
performance issues. Hopefully as soon as I think of somthing clever to get around
these issues I will be able to lift this limitation.

   There is also an update to the style sheet behavior in this version. Now when
writing your own custom style sheets the only definition that needs to have all
attributes specifed is the 'default_style' tag. All other tags with undefined
attributes will inherit them from the 'default_style'. This saves allot of repition
in defining style parameters for the various tags.

NEW: [features/improvements]
+Experimental Autocompletion support for python files
+Custom Style Sheets are even easier to write
+Better handling of user level config/resource files
+Editor now checks when opening a file to see if the file is already open in an
   existing buffer and asks if you want to open it again if its already open.
+Drag and Drop text is now supported
+Command Bar Search now has match case/ whole word options
+Line number margin visibilty can be toggled
+Generated HTML files are now on average 20-50% smaller in size.
+A first draft of a platform independent setup script.
+More complete Japanese Translations
+Remember and set carat positions between sessions

BUG FIXES:
+Improper window sizing after removing toolbar from view
+Style editor now properly catches clicks on the frames close button
+Unicode handled properly in Style Editor
+Adding missing attribute to SQL highlighter
+Can now cut/copy/paste in and out of all dialogs
+Fixed some bugs in the style sheet parser
+Fixed some sizing issues when switching controls in the command bar
+Indentation Guide Visibility can be properly toggled again

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------#
VERSION 0.0.94
DATE 03/12/2007
13th Snapshot Release

NEWS:
    Binaries built on updated wxPython 2.8.1.1 this fixed some performance issues
with the some of the stc controls, most notably the python documents which now
do not cause the cpu and ram usage to go out of control on the wxMAC platform.

   New UI component, the "Command Bar" is a narrow bar that is shown directly 
above the status bar. It is used to house various different controls that give 
quick and convenient access to various common commands.

   The text search system was completely rewritten and now has support for 
regular expression search and replaces. The search procedure has also been
fairly optimized over the previous one to use less memory and clock time. A new 
"quick" search control can be opened in the Command Bar by hitting 
"Ctrl+F" (MSW/GTK) or "Cmd+F" (MAC) which allows for searching text without 
opening a separate dialog. The traditional dialog still offers more options
and is available by hitting "Ctrl+Shift+F" (MSW/GTK) or "Cmd+Shift+F" (MAC)

  An HTML generator that outputs a fully styled html page that is styled to
look the same as the text does in the editor window.

NEW: [features/improvements]
+Text control fold margin is now styled to match the syntax scheme's default
foreground and background colors.
+Bookmark system for marking lines and quickly navigating to them
+New search system with support for regular expression search and replace
+Search history is saved from search to search in a single session
+Command Bar, a multi-purpose window for housing controls in the bottom of
editing pane.
+A Firefox like Search Bar, housed in the Command Bar (Ctrl+F) to access
+A Goto Line control, housed in the Command Bar (Ctrl+G) to access
+Color printing modes
+Code Folding can be turned on and off
+An HTML generator for generating html pages from text files
+Broader Unicode support

BUG FIXES:
+Fixed bug in config directory creation caused by the logger
+Improper file creation/deletion fixed in Windows Installer
+Improper keywordlist formatting in cpp syntax module
+EOL mode menu updating (GTK/MSW)
+Select All works again on (MSW)

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------#
VERSION 0.0.90
DATE 02/27/2007
Twelfth Snapshot Release

NEWS:
 Updated program to run on Python 2.5 and wxPython 2.8

 The translations of the editor now use the standard gettext system with mo/po
 files. All display strings have been converted to be used in this system.

 Highlighting color schemes can be customized through writing style sheets to
 describe the theme you want the text to be highlighted in. Style sheets can be
 written very easily by using the new builtin style editor which allows for on
 the fly testing and customization of the text controls styles, can export all
 settings to a style sheet in Editra Style Sheet format.

 of the code as well as removing redundant operations and old code that is no
 longer in use.

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------#
VERSION 0.0.83
DATE 01/15/2007
Eleventh Snapshot Release

NEWS:
  The goals of the work on this version were focused on a general cleanup and
  refactoring of the core modules as much of the code in these modules has been
  there since I first started getting my feet wet with python and wx widgets.

  The main cleanup effort was focused on the text control code. This lead to a
  complete reworking of the syntax management code into its own separate subsystem.
  This allowed for some minor performance improvements as well as a slightly smaller
  memory footprint since the editor now dynamically loads syntax settings/specs 
  only when they are needed instead of preloading all supported syntax/style specs
  like it previously did.

  Also as of this release all changes where made using Editra to edit itself. 
  Which has allowed me do bug testing while I work and see what parts of the 
  editor are lacking. 

NEW: [features/improvements]
+More configuration options available in Preference Dialog
+The editor now has 2 distinct modes of operation that can be configured by
 setting the MODE value in your profile. The default mode is CODE which just
 runs the editor in a normal mode. The second mode is DEBUG it will create and
 run a debugging window that displays all the programs debugging information.
+Enhanced debugging messages
+Improved Syntax/Filetype Detection
+More Complete/Accurate Syntax definitions for all supported languages
+Improved Brace/Bracket Highlighting
+AutoComp/Keyword Helper is now bound to ALT key and toggles on/off by pushing 
 button again.
+Optimized bytecode for Mac OS X binaries
+"Improved" Printing Support (its better but still mostly broken)
+Editor can remember its window size/position on exit and automatically restore 
 it self to that size/position on next launch.
+More complete Japanese translation

BUG FIXES:
+Proper setting of page images
+Menu Updating Fixes
+Proper handling of file save/saveas errors

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------#
VERSION 0.0.80
DATE 12/02/2006
Tenth Snapshot Release

NEWS:
  I've been fairly busy and hopefully it shows. I did a more thorough testing
  of the program and was able to flush out a fair number of bugs, while at the
  same time making some big improvements in usability and new features.

  Major UI upgrades and improvements to page management/layout system.

  The initial implementation of the plugin system for customizing the
  menus language is in place. It is a fairly simple system uses a custom
  python module as the language source. For a more complete explanation see
  the sample English module in the languages directory of your installation.

  The Preferences Dialog can now be used to configure the interfaces language
  and some of the other features such as Syntax Highlighting and Indentation Guides.
  Changing the language however requires closing and restarting the editor before
  the changes will take effect.

  UTF-8 Support has temporarily been disabled until a number of bugs related to
  it can be resolved.
