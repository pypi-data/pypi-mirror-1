INSTALLATION:

Binary:

Windows:
For windows there is a self extracting installer available, just double click 
on it and it will bring up the familiar windows installer interface just
follow the on screen instructions.

Linux:
Currently no binary installer package has been put together.

Macintosh:
Mount the disk image and drag the applet to your applications folder

Source:

If run the program as a python package it does not need to be installed unless
you wish to make it available for all users on the system. It can simply be run
by launching the script Editra or src/Editra.py in the package directory. If you
choose to install it from source read the next paragraph.

As of version 0.0.96 there is an installer script for  installing the sources on
*nix based systems (osx included). It is yet to be heavily tested so it may not
work on your system. To do the install just do the usual python thing.

somebody@somewhere ~/editra/> python setup install

This will install Editra in the site-packages directory of your python
installation, and place a program launcher script on you PATH. To run the 
program simply type Editra at your command prompt.
