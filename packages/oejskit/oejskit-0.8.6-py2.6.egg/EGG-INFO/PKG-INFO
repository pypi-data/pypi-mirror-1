Description: jskit
        =======
        
        jskit contains infrastructure and in particular a `py.test`_  plugin to
        enable running tests for JavaScript code inside browsers directly
        using py.test as the test driver. Running inside the browsers comes
        with some speed cost, on the other hand it means for example the code
        is tested against the real-word DOM implementations.
        
        .. _`py.test`: http://codespeak.net/py/dist/test/test.html
        
        The approach also enables to write integration tests such that the
        JavaScript code is tested against server-side Python code mocked as
        necessary. Any server-side framework that can already be exposed
        through WSGI (or for which a subset of WSGI can be written to
        accommodate the jskit own needs) can play along.
        
        jskit also contains code to help modularizing JavaScript code
        which can be used to describe and track dependencies dynamically
        during development and that can help resolving them statically when
        deploying/packaging.
        
        jskit depends on simplejson. It also uses `MochiKit`_ - of
        which it ships a version within itself for convenience - for its own
        working though in does not imposes its usage on tested code.
        
        .. _`MochiKit`: http://mochikit.com/
        
        jskit was initially developed by *Open End* AB and is released under the MIT license.
