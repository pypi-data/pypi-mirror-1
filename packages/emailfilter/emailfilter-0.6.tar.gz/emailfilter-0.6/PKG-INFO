Description: EMailFilter is a customizable e-mail content filter
        written in Python. It consists of the following
        Python modules and shell scripts:
        
        - **EMAILFILTER.PY**: the core filter logic; it allows
        you to add as many Python filtering modules as you
        want, and will give each filtering module a chance
        to examine each e-mail message and (possibly) add
        'X-' headers to record its findings.
        
        - **EMAILFILTERD.PY**: the preferred mode of operation
        for EMailFilter; it wraps EMAILFILTER.PY in a daemon
        that listens on a user-specific port (currently the
        port number is 5590 + the user id) and processes each e-mail
        message sent to it through that port.
        
        - **EMAILFILTERC.PY**: a command-line client program that
        takes its standard input, sends it through a socket
        to the daemon on the appropriate port, receives the processed
        data back, and writes it to standard output. This
        is *not* the preferred method of talking to the daemon;
        see the ``emailfilterc`` shell script below.
        
        - **EMAILFILTERDEFS.PY**: common definitions for all
        the above modules.
        
        - **EMAILFILTERD**: a shell script to invoke the daemon.
        
        - **EMAILFILTERC**: a shell script to invoke the client; it
        can use ``emailfilterc.py`` above if necessary, but this
        is slow because it requires a new instance of the Python
        interpreter to be loaded for each e-mail message (the
        message comes in on standard input and the processed
        message is written to standard output). The preferred
        method is to use either the CFilter program (available on
        SourceForge, see http://cfilter.sourceforge.net) as
        the client (this is done by invoking this script with
        the ``-c`` option) or the "TCP/IP swiss army knife"
        netcat program (this is done by invoking the script with
        either the ``-n`` option, if netcat goes by the command
        name ``nc``, or the ``-t`` option if it goes by the
        command name ``netcat`` -- which name it will be depends
        on which specific flavor of Unix/Linux you are running).
        
        Most e-mail clients can be set up to invoke any
        desired filter program, sending it messages on standard
        input and receiving processed messages on standard output;
        thus, to use EMailFilter, simply tell your e-mail client
        to invoke ``emailfilterc -c`` as the filter program (you
        can leave out the ``-c``, but as above, filtering will be
        significantly slower).
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install EMailFilter, you can simply run::
        
        $ python setup.py install
        
        at a shell prompt from the directory into which you
        unzipped the source tarball (the same directory that this
        README file is in). This will install EMailFilter, and then
        run each of the post-install scripts in the scripts
        directory.
        
        EMailFilter requires the PLIB Python library package,
        which is available from the Python Package Index under the
        name ``plib``. However, the helper module used by EMailFilter's
        setup script, ``SetupHelper``, can automatically detect if
        you don't have PLIB installed, and if so, it will download
        and install it for you before installing EMailFilter.
