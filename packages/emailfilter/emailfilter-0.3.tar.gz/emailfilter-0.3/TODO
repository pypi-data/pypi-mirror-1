TODO items for EMailFilter as of Version 0.3

- Add some simple filtering algorithms to
  ``emailfilter.py`` so that users wanting just
  the basics don't have to write a separate Python
  module. Add an INI file so that the simple
  filtering options can be configured.

- Add Windows support by adding batch files
  corresponding to the ``emailfilterc`` and
  ``emailfilterd`` scripts. (Question: will that
  be enough to run a 'daemon' in Windows?)
