TODO items for EMailFilter as of Version 0.5

- Add some simple filtering algorithms to
  ``emailfilter.py`` so that users wanting just
  the basics don't have to write a separate Python
  module. Add an INI file so that the simple
  filtering options can be configured.

- Add the ability to pipe messages through other
  programs, so that EMailFilter can serve as a
  "master" filter program, instead of having to
  add each pipe separately to your e-mail client.
  This also means that there needs to be a general
  method for specifying the ordering of filters,
  both pipes and Python modules.

- Add the ability for a filter to prevent any
  further filters from processing by returning a
  special value (or possibly have filters return
  a tuple of <header value or None>, <True to
  stop processing, False to continue>).

- Add Windows support by adding batch files
  corresponding to the ``emailfilterc`` and
  ``emailfilterd`` scripts. (Question: will that
  be enough to run a 'daemon' in Windows?)
