Change Log for EMailFilter Version 0.5

Version 0.5
-----------

- Updated to the PLIB version 0.6 API for socket I/O.

- Added exception handling to ensure that if any of
  the filtering modules raise an exception, the e-mail
  message is sent back unchanged.

Version 0.4
-----------

- Changed client and request handler to use refactored
  socket I/O functionality in version 0.5 of ``plib``.

- Added the ``-n`` and ``-t`` options to the client script
  ``emailfilterc`` to enable use of netcat (it has to be
  two options because netcat goes by two command names,
  ``nc`` and ``netcat``, so there's an option for each).

Version 0.3
-----------

- The ``setup.py`` script now uses a 'generic' helper
  module, ``SetupHelper``; all that is done in setup.py
  itself is to define variables and then call the
  helper module entry point. The SetupHelper module
  is available as its own PyPI project, ``setuphelper``.
  The ``setup_vars.py`` file is no longer needed and
  has been removed.

- SetupHelper also automatically downloads
  dependencies, in this case the PLIB Package; this
  release of EMailFilter is concurrent with the 0.2
  release of PLIB that enables this as well.

- Since SetupHelper handles running post-install
  scripts, the ``install-all`` shell script is no longer
  needed and has been removed.

Version 0.2
-----------

- EMailFilter now uses a unique port number for each
  user (since each user is intended to have their own
  instance of the daemon running anyway, to enable
  user-specific filter logic).

- The setup script is now a 'generic' ``setup.py``; customization
  is done by setting variables in ``setup_vars.py``. (I use
  this now for all my Python programs, but EMailFilter
  was my 'pilot' project for testing out the scheme.)

Version 0.1
-----------

Initial release.
