Welcome to code-centered Issue tracking!

ciss-0.1 is an alpha release, actually started to code today,
but i am starting to use it already so i am a good boy 
and release it.

ciss, what?  it's:

- a command line tool for managing your ISSUES.txt 
- code-centered: associate issues to file patterns in your project
- extensible: assign tags for status/milestone/custom usage.
- super-powerful issue editing: your text editor! 

Check it out:

And in case you wonder, why i don't use pitz or ditz? 
For one, I don't want to edit my issues from an 
interactive prompt, sorry.  Second, they create
directories and whatnot - but ISSUES.txt is a natural
place to keep things. 

anyway, have fun,
holger
