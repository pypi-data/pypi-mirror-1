Description: z3c.recipe.openoffice
        =====================
        
        This recipe download openoffice in your buildout, it can also (optional)
        create egg with pyuno and change the default python used by openoffice.
        
        More info about Python UNO: http://udk.openoffice.org/python/python-bridge.html
        
        We are using this to generate OpenOffice documents from zope/python
        
        Buildout configuration:
        -----------------------
        
        Add this section to your buildout configuration::
        
        [buildout]
        parts =
        ... your other parts ...
        openoffice
        ...
        
        [openoffice]
        recipe = z3c.recipe.openoffice
        
        This will just download and install openoffice in your buildout
        
        To create the pyuno egg add the fallowing config::
        
        [openoffice]
        recipe = z3c.recipe.openoffice
        install-pyuno-egg = yes
        
        To also change openoffice python, add the following config::
        
        [openoffice]
        recipe = z3c.recipe.openoffice
        install-pyuno-egg = yes
        hack-openoffice-python = yes
        
        By default it will fetch version OpenOffice 2.3 but you might want to install from another location or another version like this::
        
        [openoffice]
        recipe = z3c.recipe.openoffice
        install-pyuno-egg = yes
        hack-openoffice-python = yes
        version = 2.3.1
        download-url = ftp://ftp.openoffice.skynet.be/pub/ftp.openoffice.org/stable/2.3.1/OOo_2.3.1_LinuxIntel_install_en-US.tar.gz
        
        Notes:
        ------
        
        For this to work an OpenOffice process need to be running in background. As this require a X server and you don't want to install a real X server in a production environment you might want to use Xvfb. Here are the lines we use to start openoffice::
        
        $ cd myBuildout
        $ Xvfb :3 -ac -screen sn 800x600x16 &
        $ ./parts/openoffice/program/soffice "-accept=socket,host=localhost,port=2002;urp;" -display :3 &
        $ ./bin/instance start
        
        This recipe only works with linux at the moment
