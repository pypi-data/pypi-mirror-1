# Installing

## Python

If `sudo easy_install couchapp` doesn't work for you, you can install from source.

    git clone git://github.com/couchapp/couchapp.git
    cd couchapp
    sudo python setup.py install

You may need to satisfy some dependencies. We hope this will happen automatically but... you never know.
