TheMingServer 0.7.0
  (tar.gz is a standard Python distribution package)

The Ming Server generates web pages statically or dynamically.  As a local
executable, it generates a static site from a directory tree of simple
text files.  Installed in cgi-bin, it creates those same pages on
demand, in response to browser requests.  Parsing of different source
types, the creation, and the writing of pages are separated, making it
easy to extend The Ming Server to new data types or delivery methods.
