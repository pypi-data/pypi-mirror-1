<h4>Read it for a mere pittance: $$FEE (US)</h4>

<p>Here's your chance to support this author, $AUTHOR,
directly.  On this site, authors get 60% to 80% of these payments,
directly from you, the reader, into that author's PayPal account. When
you pay them, we are not in the loop. Think about it.  If the reader
won't support the writer, who will?</p>

<p>Payments are made directly to the author's PayPal account and
purchased files are delivered by the author.  $AUTHOR will send you a
copy of <b>$PROPERTY</b> as a reply-to response to his or her copy of the
PayPal receipt.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: You are purchasing this work from an individual and not
from a high-tech web site or from some big corporation.  Authors on this
site are required to check their email once a day but are only human.
<a href="mailto:$SITE_EMAIL">Email us</a> if there
is a problem.</p>

<p><b>Billy-Bob's Note</b>: As you know, our provider gets
one in ten of these payments and Aladeweb is in Spain. So guess what
language their PayPal pages are in. If Spanish PayPal pages are more
than you can deal with at the moment, and we all have moments, use the
donation button on <a
href="http://billy-bob-ming/cgibin/ming.cgi?page=sites/billybob/contact">this page</a> to pay
for what you want to read. We'll make sure they don't lose their turn.
Put the title of the work in the note thingy on PayPal and we'll email
you your purchase.</p>
