<h4>Read it for a mere pittance: $$FEE (US)</h4>


<p>Here's your chance to support this author, $AUTHOR,
directly.  On this site, authors get 60% to 80% of these payments,
directly from you, the reader, into that author's PayPal account. When
you pay them, we are not in the loop. Think about it.  If the reader
won't support the writer, who will?</p>

<p>The "PayPal" button below will take you to PayPal's
secure servers.  After your transaction at PayPal is complete, there
will be a "Continue" link on their confirmation page that will
load $PROPERTY into your browser.  Make sure you <b>save this
page to disk</b> using the Save As option in your browser's File
menu. Payments are made directly to the author's PayPal account.  But
our software loads the purchase in your browser.  So <a
href="mailto:$SITE_EMAIL">email us</a>, attaching your PayPal receipt,
if there is a problem.</p>

<p><b>Billy-Bob's Note</b>: As you know, our provider gets
one in ten of these payments and Aladeweb is in Spain. So guess what
language their PayPal pages are in. If Spanish PayPal pages are more
than you can deal with at the moment, and we all have moments, use the
donation button on <a
href="http://billy-bob-ming/cgibin/ming.cgi?page=sites/billybob/contact">this page</a> to pay
for what you want to read. We'll make sure they don't lose their turn.
Put the title of the work in the note thingy on PayPal and we'll email
you your purchase.</p>
