Description
-----------

The Ming Server is a lightweight cgi-based python application, whose
function is that of serving a variety of dynamic contents through the
web. The parsing of different source types, the creation and the writing
of pages are separated, making it easy to extend The Ming Server to new
data types or delivery methods.

The MingMods are modules which connect the audience of your digital
properties to your PayPal account.  Direct modules load the purchase
into the buyer's browser.

MingZine is an e-zine engine that allows you to publish digital works,
connect their sales to PayPal, and to tithe a percentage of those sales
to support the e-zine itself.  It also has a submissions queue which can
manage multiple types of submissions in each Ming Server subsite as well
as multiple editors.


Requirements
------------

Python 2.2 or greater.


Installation
------------

Refer to the included INSTALL file for quick installation instructions.

Our site, http://billy-bob-ming.com, is a running example of The
Ming Server and its related pieces where you can poke around to
see how it works. Or write us a billy-bob@billy-bob-ming.com and we'll
help you figure it out.


Documentation
-------------

There are seven text files in the docs directory covering the server,
the mods, and the e-zine.
