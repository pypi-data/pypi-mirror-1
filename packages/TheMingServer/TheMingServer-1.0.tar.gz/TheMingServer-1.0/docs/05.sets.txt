              MingMods DirectSets

    What is DirectSets?

    Customer can preview a subset of the properties. Button on preview takes them to a decision page explaining the  purchase.
    Button on decision page loads transaction into PayPal's secure server. Customer then clicks on PayPal's "Continue"  button
    and the purchased page containing the complete set of properties is loaded into the customer's browser.

    How to use DirectSets

    DirectSets is designed for  those who wish  to sell their  digital works and  have those works  delivered directly to  the
    customers browser. DirectSets previews a subset of files and delivers the whole set.

    If you have only a web site, not even a domain, and have access to Python 1.5.2 in the cgi-bin, you can use DirectSets  to
    connect your audience's appreciation to your own PayPal account.

    These demos  assume  that  you  have installed  The  Ming  Server  and  DirectSets in  your  cgi-bin  according  to  their
    documentation.

    Important

    The Ming Mods software is released under the GNU General  Public License. It is freely available for your use--no  strings
    attached to me. You  are also welcome  to any technical part  of these demo  pages. They will help  you understand how  to
    connect The Ming Mods  to your site. But  the literary properties on  this site are copyrighted  by their authors and  all
    rights are reserved by those authors.

    Example

    I have put together an example using poetry. The poetry files are in sites/ming/direct_sets/poetry in files like this:

 html

 smick smack mallet falls<br>
 walnut chips rain locally<br>
 dovetails follow blade<br>

    These files have either "html" or "pre" in the first line and HTML or preformatted text in the following lines.

    The "key" file, used in  other The Ming Mods  modules is called "set.key"  to keep The Ming  Server from linking in  these
    files. There has to be a "set.key" and a "set.notes" which is used to explain the set.

    Here is the "set.notes":

 <center><table width=90%><tr><td>
 <h4>Country Matters</h4>
 A Chapbook by Richard Harris
 <br>Copyright 1996, 2001
 <br>All rights reserved.

 <h4>Acknowledgments</h4>
 For <b>Jehiel Harleston Crites</b>,<br>
     who is a place in himself,<br>
 and for <b>Bill Lombard</b>,<br>
     who shared all the acres<br>
         of his home with us.

    If the software detects  a "table" and/or a"center"  on the first line  of the notes, it  will provide the close-table  or
    -center tags.

    Now, you can  preview the set  one of two  ways. In  demos/direct_sets there are  the two choices  below: Country  Matters
    (count) and (list).

    Note in the two examples below that you must follow "DirectSets" with ":plain". This is a server-parsing thing.

    Count previews the first "count" files. Here is a file called "country" that does this:

 DirectSets:plain
 Richard Harris
 1.00
 my_email@some.com
 sites/ming/direct_sets/poetry
 3

    The order is important: DirectSets, author, price, PayPal email, dir the set is in, count.

    Or you can list the files from the set dir that you wish to preview:

 DirectSets:plain
 Richard Harris
 1.00
 my_email@some.com
 sites/ming/direct_sets/poetry
 19.budoodle
 05.deer_hunter

    The numbers are for my convenience, the files are ordered by "set.key" just as they are by "key".

    Finally, here is our property_list file in data/sites/ming-cgi that controls access:

 Country Matters (count)=sites/ming/direct_sets/poetry=page
 Country Matters (list)=sites/ming/direct_sets/poetry=page

    You have the title, the path, and the type. The only type  so far is "page" which creates a page of the complete set  upon
    purchase. Other types could be created to deliver mp3 or video files.
