    How to use DirectSingles

    DirectSingles is designed for those who wish  to sell their digital works and  have those works delivered directly to  the
    customers browser.  DirectSingles sends  the customer  to PayPal.  If the  purchase is  made, PayPal  sends them  back  to
    DirectSingles which loads the purchase into the customer's browser.

    If you have only a web site, not even a domain, and have access to Python 1.5.2 in the cgi-bin, you can use  DirectSingles
    to connect your audience's appreciation to your own PayPal account.

    These demos  assume that  you  have installed  The  Ming Server  and  DirectSingles in  your  cgi-bin according  to  their
    documentation.

    Remarks upon the Form of Number in preformatted text

    Let's say you have written something interesting and you'd like to publish it on the web even though you don't know  HTML.
    You can get a geeky friend to set up The Ming Server and DirectSingles. But how do you publish your writing?

    Start with the "key" file in the directory the work  will go in. Key files list filename, title, and optional  description
    of all file in a directory that are used by The Ming Server.

    Put these lines in the key:

 remarks
 Remarks upon the Form of Number

    Type your work in an editor, or save it out to text  from your word-processor. Save it in that directory as "moon". In  an
    editor, give it a heading like this:

 DirectSingles:pre
 <!--price-->
 1.00
 <!--email-->
 my_email@some.com
 <!--content-->
 Remarks upon the Form of Number
 Richard Harris
 Copyright 1995, 2001
 All rights reserved.


    That's all you need. The first line  tells DirectSingles you are using preformatted  text for data. Next two lines  handle
    the price, a whopping 50 cents. Two  lines for your PayPal email account. Then  a content-marker. You have to provide  the
    title and author lines for The Ming Server. The rest of the page is yours.

    DirectSingles creates a preview page from your work and puts buttons on it which allow the audience to pay if they wish to
    read the entire work. Hitting those buttons takes them to a decision page, which can be customised by you; it's only HTML.

    IF they hit the  PayPal button on  the decision page, they  go to PayPal  and can purchase your  work. After payment,  the
    customer clicks on PayPal's "Continue"  button and is returned  to your web site  where DirectSingles loads the  purchased
    page into the browser.

    Remarks upon the Form of Number in HTML

    Okay. What if  your work is  already in  HTML and you  want to do  the same  thing with it?  Go get your  page. Whack  off
    everything down to and including the body  tag. Whack off anything that could be  considered a page footer that you  don't
    wish to keep. Add the following to the top but use HTML tags on the title and author lines as needed.

 DirectSingles:html
 <!--email-->
 my_email@some.com
 <!--price-->
 1.00
 <!--content-->
 <h4>Remarks upon the Form of Number</h4>
 <h4>Richard Harris</h4>

    Save it as "remarks2"

    In the "key" file, put:

 remarks2
 Remarks upon the Form of Number (2)

    Finally, in data/sites/yoursite create a file called property_list and put these lines:

      Remarks upon the Form of Number (pre)=sites/ming/direct_singles/remarks Remarks upon the Form of Number
      (HTML)=sites/ming/direct_singles/remarks2

    Note that the line MUST begin with the title of the property  you are selling as given in the KEY file. Title is  followed
    by an equals sign. After the equals sign, is the path to the property, starting from, but not including, "data". The  real
    path from cgi-bin in this case would be:
    ../data/sites/yoursite/remarks2
