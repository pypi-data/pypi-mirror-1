    Connecting Your Audience to Your PayPal Account

    There are two parts to every Ming Server revenue stream:  The Ming Server and a module to connect your digital  properties
    to your PayPal account. If you use a business or premiere  PayPal account, you can sell to anyone who uses a major  credit
    card too.

    Important Note

    You can use The Ming Server, by itself, any way that you want to regarding directory structures. But once you begin  using
    the MingMods (which are used by MingZine) you have to do it OUR WAY.

    Here's our way: All sites on a Ming Server site are "subsites". So all data, except for meta-things like MingZine's  code,
    goes in a subdirectory of data/sites. "Your Site" would go into /data/sites/yoursite. This lets us treat all sites equally
    and simplifies the code enormously.

    It also has an interesting side effect. Let's say you  run MingZine and one of your subsites becomes successful enough  to
    want to leave and have its own site.  Maybe the two of you are too  busy for one hardware server. This successful  subsite
    gets a new host,  sets up all  our MingWare and drops  his old subsite,  file for file, into  the new server's  data/sites
    directory. And his site is running just like before.

    AND because he was already mapping customers into the old server with domain names, the customers will never notice such a
    physical relocation of a subsite. Cool, non?
