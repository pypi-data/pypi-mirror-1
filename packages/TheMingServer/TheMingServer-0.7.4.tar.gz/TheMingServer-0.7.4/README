The Ming Server README

The Ming Server generates web pages statically or dynamically.  As a local
executable, it generates a static site from a directory tree of simple
text files.  Installed in cgi-bin, it creates those same pages on
demand, in response to browser requests.  Parsing of different source
types, the creation, and the writing of pages are separated, making it
easy to extend The Ming Server to new data types or delivery methods.

Installation is described in the INSTALL file.

Using The Ming Server is explained in TheMingServer.html in the docs directory.

The example web's source is in ./example.  Using the command--

					 python cgi-bin/ming.cgi example testdir

   -- will create a static web from this source in ./testdir
