Description
-----------

The Ming Server is a lightweight cgi-based python application, whose
function is that of serving a variety of dynamic contents through the
web. The parsing of different source types, the creation and the writing
of pages are separated, making it easy to extend The Ming Server to new
data types or delivery methods.


Requirements
------------

Python 2.2 or greater.


Installation
------------

Refer to the included INSTALL file for quick installation instructions.

Our site, http://billy-bob-ming.com, is a running example of The
Ming Server and its related pieces where you can poke around to
see how it works. Or write us a billy-bob@billy-bob-ming.com and we'll
help you figure it out.


Documentation
-------------

The old Ming Server's manual is available online at this URL:

http://billy-bob-ming.com/cgibin/ming.cgi?page=sites/ming-cgi/01server/index

WARNING: this manual has not been updated since version 0.7!
An updated set of docs will be available as soon as version 1.0 is released.


Release Notes
-------------

Starting from this release, the server produces strict XHTML output.
However, please note that:
- the 3tml page type is not (and won't probably ever be) fully XHTML
  compliant;
- it is still up to the user to make sure that the templates' content
  conforms to the XHTML specification.
