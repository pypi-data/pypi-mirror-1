Description: Maybe you'd like a server that gives you control of your site, that
        keeps its own log, a server that serves HTML, pre-formatted text, or the
        output of any Python code wrapped in a data page.  That's what The Ming
        Server does.  And it is the basis for the MingMods which connect your
        content to your PayPal account and for MingZine which lets you publish
        other people this way and take a percentage of their direct sales.
