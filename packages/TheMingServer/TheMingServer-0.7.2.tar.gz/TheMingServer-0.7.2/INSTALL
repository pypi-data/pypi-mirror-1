The Ming Server Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[1] Installation for dynamic use in cgi-bin is described in
docs/TheMingServer.html

[2] To install the package for static use, run the following command:

						python setup.py install

Alternatively, copy the whole TheMingServer directory into your Python
path (eg. unix: /usr/local/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages, Windows:
C:\PythonXY, or C:\PythonXY\Lib\site-packages).  That's all that
setup.py does.  Only copy the TheMingServer directory that's inside the
distributed tarball/zip-archive, not the entire TheMingServer-x.x.x
directory!

[3] The docs directory is not handled by setup.py.  You can put it
anywhere that is convenient.

[4] The executable file is "ming.cgi" in the user directory.  Put this
anywhere on your path for static usage.  On a web site, put it in
cgi-bin.

[5] The other files are described in the README.
