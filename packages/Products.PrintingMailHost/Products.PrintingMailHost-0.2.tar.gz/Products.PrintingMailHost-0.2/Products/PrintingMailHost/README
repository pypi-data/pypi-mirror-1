PrintingMailHost
================

This is a hack. :)

This product, when installed, will check if Zope is running in debug mode,
and if so, monkey patch (that is, grab the internals of, squeeze tight, then
rip hard, just like monkeys do) Zope's MailHost class, meaning that *any and
all* uses of a MailHost will be "fixed" so that instead of sending mail, it
prints messages to the standard output.

This is useful if you don't have a local mailhost for testing, or if you
prefer not to spam the crap out of yourself whilst finding out if your bulk
mail script is working.

If Zope is not running in debug mode, it will not install itself. However,
I wouldn't recommend putting it on a production site. You never know what
those monkeys may get up to...
