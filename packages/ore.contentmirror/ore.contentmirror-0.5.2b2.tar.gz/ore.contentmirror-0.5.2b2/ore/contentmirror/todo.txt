- MySQL File Truncation

  mysql's default blob implementation has a size limit, and silently truncates data 
  ( shouldn't surprise any mysql users ;-). alternatively we should detect the 
  use of mysql when generating the sql, and automatically use the large blob type.

  detect database field type binary on startup

  for files table, function setFileColumnKind
