Description: .. contents::
        
        This is an implementation of a trashcan for Plone.
        This product customizes livesearch_reply.py and queryCatalog.py from Plone.
        It has been tested on Plone 3.2, 3.2.1, 3.2.2.
        It should work on Plone 3.3 if the two scripts have not changed.
        
        This product adds a "move to trashcan"/"restore" actions and
        a "open trashcan"/"close trashcan" links at the bottom of the page.
        
        When you move an object to the trashcan, the object is actually not moved anywhere.
        It is just hidden from the search.
        What the action does is setting a marker interface ITrashed on the object
        and on sub-objects if the object trashed is a folder. It excludes the object
        from navigation too.
        
        To see the trashed objects, you have to activate the trashcan mode with
        the "open trashcan" link at the bottom of your page.
        You can see it as a parallel world. You will see only trashed objects and the search
        now search only on trashed content.
        
        In this mode you can restore objects. You can't restore object if the parent is trashed.
        In this case you have to cut and paste the object in a non trashed folder to restore it.
        
        When you are in trashcan mode, there is some verifications which takes place.
        You can't paste an object in a trashed folder for example.
        
        To come back to the normal mode, click on the "close trashcan" link at the bottom of the page.
        When trahscan mode is closed, it returns to the nearest parent not trashed.
