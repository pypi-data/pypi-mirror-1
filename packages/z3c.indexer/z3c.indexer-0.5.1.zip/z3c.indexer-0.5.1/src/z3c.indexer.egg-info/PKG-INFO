        0.5.1 (2008-12-11)
        ------------------
        
        - Bugfix: SearchQuery wasn't able to act correct if initialized with query=None
        because of an empty result setup. The And() and Not() methods could not act
        correctly with this an empty initilized result.
        
        - Bugfix: SearchQuery.And() and Not() didn't return an empty result if previous
        or given query result was empty. The previous result was returned.
        
        - Feature: implemented new indexing strategy which uses transaction and thread
        local for prevent to index an object more then once per transaction.
        
        - Bugfix: performance tests, not query did not show the right timer in catalog
        cell.
        
        - Feature: added optional searchResultFactory. This class get used as a search
        result wrapper. By default the ResultSet class get used.
        
        - Feature: Expose SearchQuery.results property. Ensure that we return always an
        empty result if None is given and allow to override existing results as a
        part of the SearchQuery API.
        
        - Feature: Implemented optional intids argument in SearchQuery.searchResults
        method. This intids is used instead of query the IntIds util. This is usefull
        if you use builtin IIntIds objects for optimized access.
        
        - Added __repr__ for ResultSet with result lenght.
        
        - Optimized SearchQuery.And() and Not() methods. Skip given query processing
        if previous result is empty.
        
        - Code is now 100% covered by tests.
        
        
        0.5.0 (2008-05-02)
