Description: The polygons from the SVG file are tesselated using GLU functions, and used to create a pyglet Batch object of indexed vertex arrays. The Batch will aggregate all paths from an SVG file into a single OpenGL GL_TRIANGLES primitive for rendering. Each path is also exposed in its untessellated form, indexed by 'id' attribute, so the application could use them for collision detection, for example.  Currently only a subset of SVG is handled - closed polygons, filled with solid color. These may comprise multiple loops (disjoint areas or holes), but must be made up from straight line edges. Arc polygon edges, gradient fills and other SVG entities (such as rectangles or text) are not currently handled.  Requires pyglet.
