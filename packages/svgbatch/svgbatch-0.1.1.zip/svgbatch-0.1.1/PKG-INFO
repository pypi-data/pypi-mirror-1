Description: SvgBatch loads SVG files and tesselates the resulting polygons using GLU functions to create a pyglet Batch object using indexed arrays of vertices. The Batch aggregates all paths from an SVG file into a single OpenGL GL_TRIANGLES primitive for rendering. Each path is also exposed by its 'id' attributes, so the application could use them for collision detection, for example.  Currently only a subset of SVG is handled - closed polygons, filled with solid color. These may comprise multiple loops (disjoint areas or holes), but must be made up from straight line edges. Arc polygon edges and gradient fills are not currently handled.  Requires pyglet.
