=======

NOTE: Profiles have the following format: <package_name>:<profile> (e.g. my.package:default).  The profile can also be prepended with the 'profile-' if you so choose (e.g. profile-my.package:default).

site-id
    The id of the Plone site that the script will create.  This will also be used to update the site once created.  Default: Plone

admin-user
    The id of an admin user that will be used as the 'Manager'.  Default: admin

products-initial
    A list of products to quickinstall just after initial site creation

profiles-inital
    A list of GenericSetup profiles to run just after initial site creation

products
    A list of products to quickinstall each time buildout is run

profiles
    A list of GenericSetup profiles to run each time buildout is run

instance
    The name of the instance that will run the script. Default: instance

zeoserver
    The name of the zeoserver part that should be used.  This is only required if you are using a zope/zeo setup. Default: not set

site-replace
    Replace any existing plone site named site-id. Default: false

enabled
    Option to start up the instance/zeoserver.  Default: true.  This can be a useful option from the command line if you do not want to start up Zope, but still want to run the complete buildout.
    
    $ bin/buildout -Nv plonesite:enabled=false

pre-extras
    An absolute path to a file with python code that will be evaluated before running Quickinstaller and GenericSetup profiles.  Multiple files can be given.  Two variables will be available to you.  The app variable is the zope root.  The portal variable is the plone site as defined by the site-id option. NOTE: file path cannot contain spaces. Default: not set

Example
=======

Here is an example buildout.cfg with the plonesite recipe::

    [buildout]
    parts = 
        zope2
        instance
        zeoserver
        plonesite
    
    [zope2]
    recipe = plone.reciepe.zope2install
    ...
    
    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    eggs = 
        ...
        my.package
        my.other.package
    
    zcml = 
        ...
        my.package
        my.other.package
    
    [zeoserver]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2zeoserver
    ...
    
    [plonesite]
    recipe = collective.recipe.plonesite
    site-id = test
    instance = instance
    zeoserver = zeoserver
    profiles-initial = my.package:initial
    profiles = 
        my.package:default
        my.other.package:default
    post-extras =
        ${buildout:directory}/my_script.py
        ${buildout:directory}/my_other_script.py
