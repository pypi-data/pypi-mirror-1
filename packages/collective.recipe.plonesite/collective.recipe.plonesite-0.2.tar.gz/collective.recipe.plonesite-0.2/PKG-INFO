        ================
        
        - new Plone sites will be created with a datetime suffix
        which is helpful if you need to re-run new instances
        over and over again e.g. for migration purposes. If you
        need a fixed site id then explictely set the id using
        the site-id option.

        - Add buildout recipe option site-replace, defaults to
        off. Use with site-id.
        
        New recipe option site-replace = on will remove any
        existing object in app named site-id. A new plone site
        will be created to replace it.
        
        Default option setting site-replace = off will not remove
        existing objects in app named site-id.
