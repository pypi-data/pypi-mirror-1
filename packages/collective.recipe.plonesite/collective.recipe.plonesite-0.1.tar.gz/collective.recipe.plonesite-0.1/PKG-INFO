        Example usage
        =============
        
        We'll start by creating a buildout that uses the recipe::
        
        >>> write('buildout.cfg',
        ... """
        ... [buildout]
        ... parts = test1
        ...
        ... [test1]
        ... recipe = collective.recipe.plonesite
        ... option1 = %(foo)s
        ... option2 = %(bar)s
        ... """ % { 'foo' : 'value1', 'bar' : 'value2'})
        
        Running the buildout gives us::
        
        >>> print 'start', system(buildout) # doctest:+ELLIPSIS
        start...
        Installing test1.
        Unused options for test1: 'option2' 'option1'.
