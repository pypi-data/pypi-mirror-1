================

- new Plone sites will be created with a datetime suffix
  which is helpful if you need to re-run new instances
  over and over again e.g. for migration purposes. If you
  need a fixed site id then explictely set the id using
  the site-id option.

- Fixed error with uninitialized variable

- Add buildout recipe option site-replace, defaults to
  off. Use with site-id.

  New recipe option site-replace = on will remove any
  existing object in app named site-id. A new plone site
  will be created to replace it.

  Default option setting site-replace = off will not remove
  existing objects in app named site-id.
