Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This recipe enables you to create and update a Plone site as part of a buildout run.  This recipe only aims to run profiles and Quickinstall products.  It is assumed that the install methods, setuphandlers, upgrade steps, and other recipes will handle the rest of the work.
        
        NOTE: There is another recipe that does something very similar here: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.recipe.updateplone

        Options
        =======
        
        NOTE: Profiles have the following format: <package_name>:<profile> (e.g. my.package:default).  The profile can also be prepended with the 'profile-' if you so choose (e.g. profile-my.package:default).
        
        site-id
        The id of the Plone site that the script will create.  This will also be used to update the site once created.  Default: Plone
        
        admin-user
        The id of an admin user that will be used as the 'Manager'.  Default: admin
        
        products-initial
        A list of products to quickinstall just after initial site creation
        
        profiles-inital
        A list of GenericSetup profiles to run just after initial site creation
        
        products
        A list of products to quickinstall each time buildout is run
        
        profiles
        A list of GenericSetup profiles to run each time buildout is run
        
        instance
        The name of the instance that will run the script. Default: instance
        
        zeoserver
        The name of the zeoserver part that should be used.  This is only required if you are using a zope/zeo setup. Default: not set
        
        site-replace
        Replace any existing plone site named site-id. Default: false
        
        enabled
        Option to start up the instance/zeoserver.  Default: true.  This can be a useful option from the command line if you do not want to start up Zope, but still want to run the complete buildout.
        
        $ bin/buildout -Nv plonesite:enabled=false
        
        Example
        =======
        
        Here is an example buildout.cfg with the plonesite recipe::
        
        [buildout]
        parts =
        zope2
        instance
        zeoserver
        plonesite
        
        [zope2]
        recipe = plone.reciepe.zope2install
        ...
        
        [instance]
        recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
        ...
        eggs =
        ...
        my.package
        my.other.package
        
        zcml =
        ...
        my.package
        my.other.package
        
        [zeoserver]
        recipe = plone.recipe.zope2zeoserver
        ...
        
        [plonesite]
        recipe = collective.recipe.plonesite
        site-id = test
        instance = instance
        zeoserver = zeoserver
        profiles-initial = my.package:initial
        profiles =
        my.package:default
        my.other.package:default

        0.5 (2008-11-11)
        ================
        
        - Fixed a bug where already installed Products would not be re-installed
        [claytron]
        
        - Added example buildout config and updated the READMEs
        [claytron]
        
        - Re-factored the plonesite.py script
        [claytron]
        
        - A dash of PEP 8
        [claytron]
        
        0.4 (2008-11-11)
        ================
        
        - Added a 'enabled' option so that you can switch the part
        off from the command line. (buildout:parts-=plonesite doesn't
        work yet)
        [claytron]
        
        - Change the script so that profiles prefixed with 'profile-' can
        also be given.
        [claytron]
        
        - Added some docs to the recipe
        [claytron]
        
        0.3 (2008-10-30)
        ================
        
        - Added site-replace option to the readme
        [claytron]
        
        - The replace-site option is no longer required
        [claytron]
        
        0.2 (2008-10-30)
        ================
        
        - new Plone sites will be created with a datetime suffix
        which is helpful if you need to re-run new instances
        over and over again e.g. for migration purposes. If you
        need a fixed site id then explictely set the id using
        the site-id option.
        [ajung]
        
        - Fixed error with uninitialized variable
        [jeffk]
        
        - Add buildout recipe option site-replace, defaults to
        off. Use with site-id.
        
        New recipe option site-replace = on will remove any
        existing object in app named site-id. A new plone site
        will be created to replace it.
        
        Default option setting site-replace = off will not remove
        existing objects in app named site-id.
