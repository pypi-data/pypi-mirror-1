        Summary
        =======
        
        * A general purpose conversion library
        
        ConversionKit is a general purpose conversion library designed as an
        improvement to the functionality in FormEncode but using simple functions
        rather than complex schema and validators and avoiding the use of exceptions to
        flag errors. See the introducion in the manual for full details.

        2009-09-29
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Updated the license to GNU AGPLv3
        * Split the FormEncode documentation and tests out from the main docs and
        tests. FormEncode isn't officially supported and its use with ConversionKit
        is deprecated.
        
        2009-08-18
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Renamed ``new_conversion`` to ``child_conversion`` internally
        * Upgraded ``tryEach()`` to be able to assign items to a dictionary, and stop
        on the first result or first error.
        * Made ``toDictionary()`` return unicode keys by default
        * Used ``pprint()`` in the docs to help avoid the problem of dictionaries
        changing their sort order as functionality changes and help make the code
        easier to read.
        
        2009-08-11
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Allowed missing and empty errors in ``toDictionary()`` to be specified as a
        string and as a tuple as well as a dict and added in documentation and tests.
        
        2009-08-08
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Improved the documentation and checked doctests all pass
        * Refactored the ``toDictionary()`` converter to support missing and
        empty errors and defaults
        * Removed the ``nested``, ``first_stab`` and ``second_stab`` modules
        
        2009-07-31
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Clarified process around post converters
        * Changed naming convention to use a lower-case first letter for functions
        which return functions
        
        0.2.0
        -----
        
        2009-03-31
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Added Or converter
        
        2009-03-23
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Re-written from the ground up with a better naming convention and more
        explanation in the docs.
        * Implemented if_missing and if_empty.
        
        0.1.0
        -----
        
        2009-02-24
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Completely re-wrote everything again with a vastly simplified API, new
        detailed documentation, over 180 doctests and Sphinx doc generation.
        
        2009-02-21
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Added new handlers
        * Errors now return a string
        * QUERNS format error encoding supported
        * Added some more examples to the docs
        
        2009-02-19
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Complete re-write to use a convesion-oriented approach, remove groups and
        focus on nested structs as the preferred data structure. The original code
        is still available in first_stab.py
        
        0.0
        ---
        
        * Added some better error handling
        * First version
