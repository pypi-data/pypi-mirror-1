        Feed2Twitter
        ============
        
        Feed2twitter updates a twitter account from a xml feed.
        It's a free alternative to services like Twitterfeed.
        
        To install feed2twitter:
        
        1. install python-twitter:  http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/
        
        1. install feedparser:  http://www.feedparser.org/
        
        
        Install it with: python setup.py install
        
        Running:
        --------
        * You need to set your feed and your twitter account.
        * Create a folder under the $HOME of the user that will run feed2twitter called .feed2twitter
        * Add a file called default.cfg, like this:
        
        ::
        
        [global]
        url = http://example.com/rss
        username = twitter_user
        password = twitter_password
        mode = text
        interval = 01:00
        
        The url is the url for the feed that you want to publish, mode can be 'text' (140 chars of your post text) or 'title' (your post title, with a link). The interval is the interval in which the feed2twitter will publish your last posts.
        
        Run it with the command feed2twitter. It will update your twitter with your latest 5 posts, in the interval that you have set.
        
        Kudos to Gleicon da Silveira (http://zenmachine.wordpress.com/about/), that give me a idea of the code in a post of his blog.
