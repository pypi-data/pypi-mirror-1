Description: To access `Amazon AWS S3`_ from `Google App Engine`_, you not only need an S3
        interface like simples3_, but you'll also need a ported version of that
        interface that works with Google's own ``urlfetch`` extension API.
        
        ``gaes3`` is exactly that, and is layered on top of simples3_.
        
        Usage is exactly like simples3_, but with a different class::
        
        >>> from gaes3 import AppEngineS3Bucket
        >>> bucket = AppEngineS3Bucket("foo", access_key, secret_key)
        >>> bucket.info("foo")["mimetype"]
        'text/plain'
