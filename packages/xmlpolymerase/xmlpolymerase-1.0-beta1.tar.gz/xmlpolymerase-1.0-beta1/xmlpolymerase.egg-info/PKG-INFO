        Overview
        ========
        
        xmlpolymerase is a simple powerful serializer and deserializer for
        python-structures into XML. Possible structures are string, int, float, bool,
        list and dict.
        
        *The primary function of a polymerase is the polymerization of new DNA or RNA
        against an existing DNA or RNA template in the processes of replication and
        transcription.* (Cite: Wikipeadia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase)
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        This is a pure python module. The API is pretty simple, for more read the
        docstrings, an exampkle follows:
        
        >>> from odict import OrderedDict
        >>> teststructure = OrderedDict()
        >>> teststructure['one'] = 'Eins'
        >>> teststructure['two'] = 'Zwei'
        >>> teststructure['three'] = 'Drei'
        >>> teststructure['four'] = [True, 2, '3-2', 42.23]
        >>> domnode = serialize(structure, nodename='object')
        <object>
        <one>
        Eins
        </one>
        <two>
        Zwei
        </two>
        <three>
        Drei
        </three>
        <four type="list">
        <entry type="bool">
        True
        </entry>
        <entry type="int">
        2
        </entry>
        <entry>
        3-2
        </entry>
        <entry type="float">
        42.23
        </entry>
        </four>
        </object>
        <BLANKLINE>
        
        >>> structure = deserialze(domnode)
        OrderedDict([('one', 'Eins'), ('two', 'Zwei'), ('three', 'Drei'), ('four', [True, 2, '3-2', 23.42])])
