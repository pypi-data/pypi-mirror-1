Description: 
        With ArchGenXML you can create working python code without writing one single
        line of python. It is is a commandline utility that generates fully functional
        Zope Products based on the Archetypes framework from UML models using XMI
        (.xmi, .zargo, .zuml) files. The most common use case is to generate a set of
        custom content types, possibly with a few tools, a CMFMember type and some
        workflows thrown in.
        
        In practice, you draw your UML diagrams in a tool like Poseidon or ObjectDomain
        which has the ability to generate XMI files. Once you are ready to test your
        product, you run ArchGenXML on the XMI file, which will generate the product
        directory. After generation, you will be able to install your product in Plone
        and have your new content types, tools and workflows available.
        
        At present, round-trip support is not implemented: Custom code can't be
        converted back into XMI (and thus diagams). However, you can re-generate
        your product over existing code. Method bodies and certain "protected" code
        sections will be preserved. This means that you can evolve your product's
        public interfaces, its methods and its attributes in the UML model, without
        fear of losing your hand-written code.
