Schools Theme

	Schools Plone Theme (quintagroup.theme.schools) is one of Plone skins from Alternative Plone Skins and Themes project. 

Features

  * This version of Schools Plone Theme doesn't use any additional templates to view page with photos. Henceforward Products.Carousel product is used for that purpose. The theme includes zexp file with demo photos for Products.Carousel.
 
  * New portlet manager was added to the site top right area. You can add any type of portlet there.
 
  * Schools Plone Theme top area includes logo and portlet manager, which should have the same height according to theme design. 'logoWrapperMinHeight' property (with default 107px value) was added to 'base_properties' to control top area height. To set different top area height - simply change 'logoWrapperMinHeight' value.

  * Site width can be set by defining 'pageWidth' property value in 'base_properties'. Schools Plone Theme is optimized for 1024px screen width.
  
  * If you customize 'columnTwoWidth' value, don't forget to update 'columnTwoWidthInt' value, since values in those two cells must be identical.
