Introduction
============

``celery`` is a distributed task queue framework for Django.

It is used for executing tasks *asynchronously*, routed to one or more
worker servers, running concurrently using multiprocessing.

It is designed to solve certain problems related to running websites
demanding high-availability and performance.

It is perfect for filling caches, posting updates to twitter, mass
downloading data like syndication feeds or web scraping. Use-cases are
plentiful. Implementing these features asynchronously using ``celery`` is
easy and fun, and the performance improvements can make it more than
worthwhile.

Features
========

    * Uses AMQP messaging (RabbitMQ, ZeroMQ) to route tasks to the
      worker servers.

    * You can run as many worker servers as you want, and still
      be *guaranteed that the task is only executed once.*

    * Tasks are executed *concurrently* using the Python 2.6
      ``multiprocessing`` module (also available as a backport
      to older python versions)

    * Supports *periodic tasks*, which makes it a (better) replacement
      for cronjobs.

    * When a task has been executed, the return value is stored using either
      a MySQL/Oracle/PostgreSQL/SQLite database, memcached,
      or Tokyo Tyrant backend.

    * If the task raises an exception, the exception instance is stored,
      instead of the return value.

    * All tasks has a Universaly Unique Identifier (UUID), which is the
      task id, used for querying task status and return values.

    * Supports *tasksets*, which is a task consisting of several subtasks.
      You can find out how many, or if all of the subtasks has been executed.
      Excellent for progress-bar like functionality.

    * Has a ``map`` like function that uses tasks, called ``dmap``.

    * However, you rarely want to wait for these results in a web-environment.
      You'd rather want to use Ajax to poll the task status, which is
      available from a URL like ``celery/<task_id>/status/``. This view
      returns a JSON-serialized data structure containing the task status,
      and the return value if completed, or exception on failure.
      
API Reference Documentation
===========================

The `API Reference Documentation`_ is hosted at Github
(http://ask.github.com/celery)

Installation
=============

You can install ``celery`` either via the Python Package Index (PyPI)
or from source.

To install using ``pip``,::

    $ pip install celery

To install using ``easy_install``,::

    $ easy_install celery

If you have downloaded a source tarball you can install it
by doing the following,::

    $ python setup.py build
    # python setup.py install # as root

Usage
=====

Have to write a cool tutorial, but here is some simple usage info.

*Note* You need to have a AMQP message broker running, like `RabbitMQ`_,
and you need to have the amqp server setup in your settings file, as described
in the `carrot distribution README`_.

*Note* If you're running ``SQLite`` as the database backend, ``celeryd`` will
only be able to process one message at a time, this is because ``SQLite``
doesn't allow concurrent writes.

Defining tasks
--------------

    >>> from celery.task import tasks
    >>> from celery.log import setup_logger
    >>> def do_something(some_arg, **kwargs):
    ...     logger = setup_logger(**kwargs)
    ...     logger.info("Did something: %s" % some_arg)
    ...     return 42
    >>> task.register(do_something, "do_something") 

Tell the celery daemon to run a task
-------------------------------------

    >>> from celery.task import delay_task
    >>> delay_task("do_something", some_arg="foo bar baz")


Execute a task, and get its return value.
-----------------------------------------

    >>> from celery.task import delay_task
    >>> result = delay_task("do_something", some_arg="foo bar baz")
    >>> result.ready()
    False
    >>> result.get()   # Waits until the task is done.
    42
    >>> result.status()
    'DONE'

If the task raises an exception, the tasks status will be ``FAILURE``, and
``result.result`` will contain the exception instance raised.

Running the celery daemon
--------------------------

::

    $ cd mydjangoproject
    $ env DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=settings celeryd
    [....]
    [2009-04-23 17:44:05,115: INFO/Process-1] Did something: foo bar baz
    [2009-04-23 17:44:05,118: INFO/MainProcess] Waiting for queue.


Autodiscovery of tasks
-----------------------

``celery`` has an autodiscovery feature like the Django Admin, that
automatically loads any ``tasks.py`` module in the applications listed
in ``settings.INSTALLED_APPS``.

A good place to add this command could be in your ``urls.py``,
::

    from celery.task import tasks
    tasks.autodiscover()


Then you can add new tasks in your applications ``tasks.py`` module,
::

    from celery.task import tasks
    from celery.log import setup_logger
    from clickcounter.models import ClickCount

    def increment_click(for_url, **kwargs):
        logger = setup_logger(**kwargs)
        clicks_for_url, cr = ClickCount.objects.get_or_create(url=for_url)
        clicks_for_url.clicks = clicks_for_url.clicks + 1
        clicks_for_url.save()
        logger.info("Incremented click count for %s (not at %d)" % (
                        for_url, clicks_for_url.clicks)
    tasks.register(increment_click, "increment_click")


Periodic Tasks
---------------

Periodic tasks are tasks that are run every ``n`` seconds. They don't
support extra arguments. Here's an example of a periodic task:


    >>> from celery.task import tasks, PeriodicTask
    >>> from datetime import timedelta
    >>> class MyPeriodicTask(PeriodicTask):
    ...     name = "foo.my-periodic-task"
    ...     run_every = timedelta(seconds=30)
    ...
    ...     def run(self, **kwargs):
    ...         logger = self.get_logger(**kwargs)
    ...         logger.info("Running periodic task!")
    ...
    >>> tasks.register(MyPeriodicTask)


For periodic tasks to work you need to add ``celery`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``,
and issue a ``syncdb``.
