Description: plone.recipe.zope2install
        =========================
        
        Options
        -------
        
        To specify which Zope 2 to use, use one of the following options:
        
        `url`
        The URL to a tarball to use for the Zope 2 installation.
        
        `svn`
        The URL for an subversion checkout to use for the Zope 2 installation.
        
        `fake-zope-eggs`
        If set to true, add fake egg links to Zope 3 libraries, so that setuptools
        can see and use them for dependencies lookup.
        
        `additional-fake-eggs`
        Specify an optional list of additional fake eggs. Only include packages
        which are available on the Python path. Typical examples include ZODB3
        or zdaemon.
        
        You can also specify an explicit version to fake for an egg. For example::
        
        additional-fake-eggs =
        ZODB3 = 3.7.1
        zope.annotation = 3.3.2
        
        Otherwise the faked eggs will always have version 0.0.
        
        If you use many buildouts with the same Zope 2 version, then you can add
        "zope-directory" in the "buildout" section in your ~/.buildout/default.cfg
        file like this::
        
        [buildout]
        zope-directory = /home/me/buildout/zope
        
        For installations from a tarball that directory will be used instead of the
        parts directory in your buildout. Each version of Zope will get it's own
        directory but if it's already installed the existing one will be reused.
        
        Exported variables
        ------------------
        
        The following variables are set by this recipe and can be used in other parts.
        
        `location`
        The path to the Zope installation root.
