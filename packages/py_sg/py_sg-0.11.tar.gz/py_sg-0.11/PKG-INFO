Description: This is a small Python extension which sends arbitrary commands to SCSI devices, via the Linux SCSI Generic driver, which provides the SG_IO ioctl for this purpose.
        
        Basically, the module includes two methods, read and write, which
        allow you to issue commands to SCSI devices and read and write
        accompanying data. If an OS error occurs, the OSError exception will
        be raised, while if a SCSI error occurs, the py_sg.SCSIError exception
        will be raised.
