Description: Overview
        --------
        
        
        The package is able to include the following types of resources:
        
        * Cascading stylesheets (.css)
        * Kinetic stylesheets (.kss)
        * Javascript (.js)
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        The package operates with browser resources, registered individually
        or using the resource directory factory.
        
        A simple example::
        
        <configure xmlns="http://namespaces.zope.org/zope"
        xmlns:browser="http://namespaces.zope.org/browser">
        
        <include package="z3c.resourceinclude" file="meta.zcml" />
        <include package="z3c.resourceinclude" />
        
        <browser:resource name="example.css" file="example.css" />
        
        <browser:resourceInclude
        layer="zope.publisher.interfaces.browser.IDefaultBrowserLayer"
        include="example.css"
        />
        
        </configure>
        
        
        This registration means that whenever the request provides
        ``IDefaultBrowserLayer`` the resource named 'example.css' will be
        included on the page.
        
        To render HTML snippets that include applicable resources, a content
        provider is provided, see ``z3c/resourceinclude/provide.py``. You may
        also use one of the viewlets::
        
        <browser:viewlet
        name="resourceinclude"
        class="z3c.resourceinclude.viewlets.CacheOneHourViewlet"
        permission="zope.View" />
        
        A convenience method is provided to require a given resource layer:
        
        >>> from z3c.resourceinclude import include
        >>> include(IMyLayer)
        
        Ordering
        --------
        
        Resources will be included in the order they're registered for
        inclusion; within an include-definition, order is respected only for
        resources of similar kind.
        
        Merging
        -------
        
        When not in 'devmode', the resource collector will automatically merge
        resources, giving them a filename based on the contents (sha digest).
