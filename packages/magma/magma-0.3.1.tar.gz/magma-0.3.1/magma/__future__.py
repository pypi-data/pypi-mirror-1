"""Features which should be available in the future, but aren't yet well tested. 

New Features will first be implemented here and moved to the main part of the module as soon as they are ready (to give you a bit of shielding from the mistakes we're bound to make). 

You shouldn't count on features from __feature__ to come into the present whatever happens. Some might just have been the wrong approach, and others might prove too bugprone or similar.
