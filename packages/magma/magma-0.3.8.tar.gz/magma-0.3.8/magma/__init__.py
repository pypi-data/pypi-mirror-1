"""MAGnet MAnifest Management - Readout and create lists of magnets in yaml format. 

Magma lists are lists of files which can be downloaded via magnet links. 

They are written in yaml format to be easily readable as well as flexible and powerful. 


A simple Magma file looks like the following:: 
    #MAGMAv0.4
    files:
    - filename: input_file.txt
      urn:
        sha1: 3UJCLAOIZVCNAIT7TQYFLAP7ZNFW6G2G
    - filename: input_file2.txt
      urn:
        sha1: 3UJCLAOIZVCNAIT7TQYFLAP7ZNFW6G2G


This script parses the basic features of MAGMAv0.4, which is being specified at the moment. 
It doesn't parse the current MAGMAv0.2 files!

Use it only, if you want to take a peek at what the updated specification will bring. 


It depends on U{pyyaml <http://pyyaml.org/>}, tagpy and IPy. 

An example magma file is I{example-0.4.magma}. 

This API documentation is avaible from U{http://gnuticles.gnufu.net/pymagma/}, and the code is avaible from a U{Mercurial repository <http://freehg.org/u/ArneBab/magma/>}. 

The module can also be found in the U{Python Package Index (PyPI) <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/magma/>}. It is available under the GPL-3 or later. 

It is being written by U{Arne Babenhauserheide <http://draketo.de>}. If you wish to contribute, please drop me a mail with the word "tunnel" somewhere in the subject line (to get past my spamfilter). My email: arne_bab at web de . 

Usage of this module
====================

    >>> # from magma import *
    >>> magma = open_file("example-0.4.magma")

or 

    >>> magma = create_from_input_files(["input_file.txt", "input_file2.txt"])


API / usage
===========

B{Creating magma lists from input files}
    
Create a list from input files. 
    >>> magma = create_from_input_files(["input_file.txt"])
    
Output the list, showing the empty entries, which could be filled with data. 
    >>> print magma
    #MAGMAv0.4
    files:
    - filename: input_file.txt
      gnutella:
        alt-locs: []
      urls: []
      urn:
        sha1: 3UJCLAOIZVCNAIT7TQYFLAP7ZNFW6G2G
    <BLANKLINE>
    # Magmav0.2 compatibility section
    list:
     - "magnet:?xt=urn%3Asha1%3A3UJCLAOIZVCNAIT7TQYFLAP7ZNFW6G2G&dn=input_file.txt"
    <BLANKLINE>
    
And save it to a file with the empty entries cleaned away. 
    >>> magma.save(path="example.magma")


Or just return a list of its files as MagmaFiles. 
    >>> files = magma.files
    
Or output all magnet links inside the magma list. 
   >>> print magma.magnets
   ['magnet:?xt=urn%3Asha1%3A3UJCLAOIZVCNAIT7TQYFLAP7ZNFW6G2G&dn=input_file.txt']
  
  
B{Reading from magma lists}
   
Readout the data from a file. 
   >>> magma = open_file("example.magma")
   
Now get the files inside the list. 
   >>> files = magma.files
   >>> for i in files: print i
   input_file.txt 3UJCLAOIZVCNAIT7TQYFLAP7ZNFW6G2G
   
Get the first file from the list. 
   >>> one_file = files[0]
   >>> print one_file
   input_file.txt 3UJCLAOIZVCNAIT7TQYFLAP7ZNFW6G2G
   
And output its magnet. 
   >>> print one_file.magnet
   magnet:?xt=urn%3Asha1%3A3UJCLAOIZVCNAIT7TQYFLAP7ZNFW6G2G&dn=input_file.txt
   
Or output all its (meta-) data. 
   >>> print one_file.data
   {'urn': {'sha1': '3UJCLAOIZVCNAIT7TQYFLAP7ZNFW6G2G'}, 'gnutella': {'alt-locs': []}, 'urls': [], 'filename': 'input_file.txt'}
   

Output all magnet links inside the magma list. 
   >>> print magma.magnets
   ['magnet:?xt=urn%3Asha1%3A3UJCLAOIZVCNAIT7TQYFLAP7ZNFW6G2G&dn=input_file.txt']

Load a Magma object from a string containing Magma data via magma.load(). 
As test, load a minimal Magma file, containing nothing but the header.
   >>> magma = load("#MAGMAv0.4")
   
And cry out, if the string doesn't begin with the Magma header (isn't Magma data!). 
   >>> magma = load("a:b")
   Traceback (most recent call last):
   ...
   AssertionError: Doesn't begin with Magma v0.4 header #MAGMAv0.4

Also dump yaml data via magma.dump()
   >>> print dump(magma)
   #MAGMAv0.4
   {}
   <BLANKLINE>
   # Magmav0.2 compatibility section
   list:
   <BLANKLINE>

Or just print the Magma data. 
   >>> print magma
   #MAGMAv0.4
   {}
   <BLANKLINE>
   # Magmav0.2 compatibility section
   list:
   <BLANKLINE>


Plans: Gnutella
    - Also pass metadata and include that alongside the file list. 
    - Add Alt-locs (depends on the network used). Maybe GNet-Alt-Loc for Gnutella. Gets parsed to magnet xs automatically. 
   
Ideas: 
    - Readout metadata from files, for example using the taglib, pyPdf or such. 
    - If given both magma list and files, the magma list gets extended by the files. 
    - Joining and seperating magma lists. 
    - Passing several additional input lists to join with the main list. 
    - Passing the data of files along with magma metadata to create the list. 
    - Passing the indizes of files to automatically slice the list. maybe even with the syntax sliced_magma = magma[a:b]
    - If a dir gets passed, add all files within that dir. Alsa a parameter to ask, if it should be done recursively. 
    - If hashing files takes very long (for example seen with clock.tick()), give more output. 
    - Add more commandline switches (verbose, help, ... - see the babtools_gentoo script)
