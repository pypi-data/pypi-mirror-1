            - Joining and seperating magma lists. 
            - Passing several input lists to join with the main list. 
            - Passing the data of files along with magma metadata to create the list. 
            - Passing the indizes of files to automatically slice the list. maybe even with the syntax sliced_magma = magma[a:b]
            - Readout metadata from files, for example using the taglib or such. 
            - If a dir gets passed, add all files within that dir. Alsa a parameter to ask, if it should be done rekursively.
