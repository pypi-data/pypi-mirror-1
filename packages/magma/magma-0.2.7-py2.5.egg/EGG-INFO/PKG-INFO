Description: 
        Magma lists are lists of files which can be downloaded via magnet links.
        
        They are written in yaml format to be easily readable as well as flexible and powerful.
        
        !!! IN PLANNING PHASE !!!
        
        This script parses the basic features of MAGMAv0.4, which is being specified at the moment.
        It doesn't parse the current MAGMAv0.2 files!
        
        Use it only, if you want to take a peek at what the updated specification can bring.
        
        It depends on pyyaml: http://pyyaml.org/.
        
        The API documentation is available from http://gnuticles.gnufu.net/pymagma/, and the code is available from a Mercurial repository: http://freehg.org/u/ArneBab/magma/.
