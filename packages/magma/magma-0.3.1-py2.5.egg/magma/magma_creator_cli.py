"""Create magma files interactively via commandline dialogs.

Usage: magma_creator_cli.py file1 file2, ...

Examples: 
    - magma_creator_cli.py input_file.txt input_file2.txt Infinite-Hands--free-software.ogg 


This will implement features from magma-for-streaming-mediav0.07.txt

It is mainly a proof of concept, yet. 

Ideas: 
    - Check, if tagpy or similar are avaible, and if yes, add metadata from the file tags.
