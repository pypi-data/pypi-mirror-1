    - Fix bug 237652, setuptools_bzr does not work with looms
      (https://bugs.launchpad.net/setuptoolsbzr/+bug/237652)
      
    - Added environment variable BZR_SETUPTOOLS_FORCE_CMD which, if
      set, forces the plugin to use the command line bzr(1) instead
      of the more effecient bzrlib library, even if the latter is found.
