Changelog
=========

1.1 - 2008/09/23

    - moved integer and string properties from propertiestool.xml to 
      setuphandlers, because properties were overriden with default
      values on reinstall.

    - removed max size settings from the controlpanel and reuse max_size from 
      ATContentTypes settings (zconf.ATNewsItem.max_image_dimension)

    - images may be captioned
    
    - if image is displayed in the body, it is possible to display image 
      fullscreen (the same as newsitem image)

    - it is possible to specify, which scale will be used for displaying the
      image in "description" part and which in "body" part.

    - make images "newsitem" like. Image tags uses the same CSS classes as
      news items, leadImage field uses the same scales as News Item plus one
      special 'leadimage' scale defined by user in the controlpanel.

    - it is possible to set allowed_types. Document and Folder are allowed 
      by default.

    - changed CSS - define float on the leadimage-wrapper to easily
      style leadimage itself (for example for adding border around the image)
