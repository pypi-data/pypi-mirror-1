        Overview
        --------
        
        This products adds complete support for adding descriptive image to any
        Archetypes based content in Plone site. Each object has new tab "Edit lead
        image", which allows to upload new or remove current image. It is similar
        behaviour as Plone News Item (you can add image to news item and this image is
        displayed in news item overview listing.
        
        There is folder_leadimage_view page template, which can be used to list all
        items in the folder together with images attached.
        
        There is configuration control panel, where you can set maximum width and height
        of the uploaded images. The widht and height is applied on each image upload
        (image is automatically resized).
        
        There is FieldIndex and metadata in portal_catalog: hasContentLeadImage
        (True/False).
        
        Please note, this function may be easily implemented using
        archetypes.schemaextender, but schemaextender was introduced after this product
        was built.
