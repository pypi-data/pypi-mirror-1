Description: Supported options
        =================
        
        hooks
        Custom python script(s) and method(s) that will be executed.
        The format of the options is::
        
        /path/to/the/module.py:name_of_callable
        
        where the first part is a filesystem path to the python module and
        the second part is the name of the callable in the module that
        will be called. The callable will be passed two parameters: the
        ``options`` dictionary from the recipe and the global ``buildout``
        dictionary. The callable is not expected to return anything.
        
        This code was essentially ripped out of plone.recipe.command_
        and hexagonit.recipe.cmmi_
        
        .. _plone.recipe.command  : http://dev.plone.org/collective/browser/buildout/plone.recipe.command
        .. _hexagonit.recipe.cmmi : http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hexagonit.recipe.cmmi
        
        
        Example usage
        =============
        
        It can be helpful to define in [buildout] a::
        
        hooks = ${buildout:directory}/hooks
        
        then invoke like::
        
        [your_part_section]
        hooks = ${buildout:hooks}/hookfile.py:methodname
        
        The value of 'hooks' can be a whitespace-separated list of
        files:methods to specify multiple hooks that are executed in
        order.  You can also specify options that can be used in your
        hooks.  Example::
        
        [your_part_section]
        hooks = ${buildout:hooks}/hookfile1.py:methodname1
        ${buildout:hooks}/hookfile2.py:methodname2
        ${buildout:hooks}/hookfile2.py:methodname3
        option1 = xyzzy
        option2 = You won't get it up the stairs.
