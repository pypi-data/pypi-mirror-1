Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        CronUtility provides a global utility for handling asynchron scripts (crons),
        it provides a view which handles registered crons and fires them if they are
        active.
        
        To register a new cron, just create a global or local utility providing the
        ICron interface. The utility has to implement a "active" and "run" method.
        
        CronUtility provides a view named "@@runRegisteredCrons" which has to be called
        regularly by a user having the 'Manage portal' permission. It is suggested to
        use zope clock server to call this view about ever minute or more, add the
        following configuration to your instance part's zope-conf-additional variable:
        
        ::
        <clock-server>
        method [PATH_TO_YOUR_PLONE_SITE]@@runRegisteredCrons
        period 60
        user [MANAGER_USERID]
        password [MANAGER_PWD]
