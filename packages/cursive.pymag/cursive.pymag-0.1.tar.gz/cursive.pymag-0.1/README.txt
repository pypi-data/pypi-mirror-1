``cursive.pymag``: Author tools for Python Magazine
===================================================

The routines in this ``cursive.pymag`` package are designed for authors
who are preparing material for submission to Python Magazine.  One
purpose of this package is to provide a ``pymag.format`` command for the
``cursive`` command-line tool that converts the author's Restructured
Text into the format used by the software of Python Magazine's
publisher.
