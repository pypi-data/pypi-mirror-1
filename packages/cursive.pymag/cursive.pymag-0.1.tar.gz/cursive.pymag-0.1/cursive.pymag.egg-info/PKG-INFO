Description: The routines in this ``cursive.pymag`` package are designed for authors
        who are preparing material for submission to Python Magazine.  One
        purpose of this package is to provide a ``pymag.format`` command for the
        ``cursive`` command-line tool that converts the author's Restructured
        Text into the format used by the software of Python Magazine's
        publisher.
