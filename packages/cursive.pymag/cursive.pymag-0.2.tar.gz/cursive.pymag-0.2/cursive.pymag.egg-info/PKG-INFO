Description: Python Magazine uses a special markup language, called Ceres, for
        formatting articles that are submitted by authors and then worked on by
        our editorial crew.  So that we can support Python folks who want to
        write their documents in `reStructured Text`_ instead, this package adds
        a ``pymag`` sub-command to the ``cursive`` command-line tool that
        converts an article to Ceres, and while doing so reports any problems
        with the article that might interfere with the magazine's layout.
        
        This package builds on the features of `cursive.tools`_.
