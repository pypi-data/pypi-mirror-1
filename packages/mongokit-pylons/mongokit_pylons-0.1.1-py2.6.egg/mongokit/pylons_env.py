class MongoPylonsEnv(object):
    """
    Helper class for using MongoKit inside of Pylons
    The recommended deployment is to add a call to init_mongo()
    in config/environment.py for your pylons project.
    Like with SQLAlchemy, this will setup your connections
    at Pylons boot; the MongoDB Pool code should ensure you have enough connections.
    
    Add the import at the top:
    
        >>> from mongokit.pylons_env import MongoPylonsEnv
    
    And lower down, in load_environment():

        >>> MongoPylonsEnv.init_mongo()
        
    Additionally, you'll need to add several items to your configuration ini file:
    
    
        ... # Mongo Database settings
        ... mongodb.host = localhost
        ... mongodb.port = 27017
        ... mongodb.db = your_db_name
        ... mongodb.connection_timeout = 30
        ... mongodb.pool.enable = True
        ... mongodb.pool.size = 20

    Then, you can pass keyword argument 'use_pylons' to your Document constructor, or 
    define attribute
        >>> _use_pylons = True 
    on your subclass.
    
    Alternately, for the ultimate in lazy: 
        
        >>> from mongokit.document import MongoPylonsDocument
        
    And then subclass from that (It's a proxy subclass of MongoDocument that enables use_pylons)
