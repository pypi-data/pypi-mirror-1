        PyPI package page: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pychoose
        Subversion repository: http://code.google.com/p/pychoose/
        
        From the command-line, run::
        
        > pychoose XY
        
        This will make Python version X.Y active, if it is installed, for subsequent
        commands from the same prompt. The change is local to this shell.
        
        The prompt is modified to indicate the modified environment.
        
        To revert to the previously used version of Python, type 'exit'
        
        This works by starting a new Cmd shell with a modified PATH, by prepending
        C:\\PythonXY and its subdirectories, and importantly by removing any other
        C:\\PythonZZ directories and subdirectories.
        
        Multiple invocations of pychoose can be nested.
        
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        No dependencies other than Python itself. Only tested on 2.4, 2.5, 2.6.
        
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        Windows users may download and double-click a graphical installer from
        http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pychoose.
        
        Command-line jockeys with setuptools installed may use:
        
        ``easy_install pychoose``
        
        or, if pip is installed:
        
        ``pip install pychoose``
        
        or download a zip of the source from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pychoose and use:
        
        ``python setup.py install``
        
        Alternatively, to check out the latest unstable source from subversion,
        including tests, see:
        
        http://code.google.com/p/pychoose/source/checkout.
        
        
        Known Problems
        --------------
        
        Doesn't work in a Cygwin shell, nor on other platforms.
        
        Should get install dirs of various Python version from the registry, insted of
        assuming they are all variations on C:\\PythonXX.
        
        When it operates, it changes the path to put itself out of reach! So, like
        any other Python package, it requires installing separately for each Python
        version you have installed, which is a bit irksome. It would be better if it
        installed to some location that was always on the path, even when specific Python
        versions are removed from the path. Or perhaps it should copy itself into the
        Python version being activated? Hmmm...
        
        Doesn't affect Windows .py filetype associations. Perhaps this could be tackled by
        inserting an environment variable into the registry keys, set the env var in the
        registry (to persist its default value) and then change that value temporarily
        and locally in this script.
        
        Doesn't modify PYTHONPATH. Should it ever?
        
        Currently adds all subdirectories of PythonXX to the PATH. This is probably
        overkill. Can we filter out desired subdirectories with any reliability?
