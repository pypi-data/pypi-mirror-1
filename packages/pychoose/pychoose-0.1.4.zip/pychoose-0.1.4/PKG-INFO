        PyPI: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pychoose

        Description
        -----------
        
        From the Windows command-line, run::
        
        pychoose XY
        
        This will make Python version X.Y active, if it is installed, for subsequent
        commands from the same prompt. The change is local to this shell.
        
        The prompt is modified to indicate the modified environment.
        
        To revert to the previously used version of Python, type 'exit'
        
        This works by starting a new Cmd shell with a modified PATH, by prepending
        C:\\PythonXY and its subdirectories, and importantly by removing any other
        C:\\PythonZZ directories and subdirectories.
        
        Multiple invocations of pychoose can be nested.
        
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        MS Windows.
        
        Python itself: Can be used to switch TO any version of Python at all (and then
        back again with 'exit'.) However, the version of Python you are switching FROM
        must be from 2.4 to 3.1.
        
        No other dependencies.
        
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        Windows users may download and double-click a graphical installer from
        http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pychoose.
        
        Command-line jockeys with setuptools installed may use:
        
        ``easy_install pychoose``
        
        or, if pip is installed:
        
        ``pip install pychoose``
        
        or download a zip of the source from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pychoose and use:
        
        ``python setup.py install``
        
        Alternatively, to check out the latest unstable source from subversion,
        including tests, see:
        
        http://code.google.com/p/pychoose/source/checkout.
        
        
        Experiment on WindowsXP shows that pychoose only needs to be installed once,
        on your default version of Python, not on all installed versions of Python.
        After running pychoose, it is no longer on your PATH, however the pychoose.bat
        file is still found by future invocations - presumably all shells have a
        shared cache of executable locations, or somesuch.
        
        
        Known Problems
        --------------
        
        Only works on Windows. Not in a Cygwin shell, nor if Cygwin Python is first
        on your path, nor on other platforms.
        
        Should get the install dirs of various Python versions from the registry, insted
        of assuming they are all variations on C:\\PythonXX.
        
        Would be much more reliable if we allow the user to pass the directory of the
        Python version to switch to, instead of trying to be clever and figure it out
        ourselves.
        
        Can't switch from versions of Python prior to 2.4, since we use 'subprocess' to
        launch the new shell.
        
        Doesn't affect Windows .py filetype associations. Perhaps this could be tackled by
        inserting an environment variable into the registry keys, set the env var in the
        registry (to persist its default value) and then change that value temporarily
        and locally in this script.
        
        Haven't tested how it interacts with virtualenv.
        
        Currently adds all subdirectories of PythonXX to the PATH. This is probably
        overkill. Can we filter out desired subdirectories with any reliability?
