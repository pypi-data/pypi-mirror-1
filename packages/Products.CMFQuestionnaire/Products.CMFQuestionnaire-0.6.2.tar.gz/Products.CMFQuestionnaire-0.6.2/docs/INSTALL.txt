This product can be installed the standard way:

* Unpack the archive into the 'Products' directory and restart Zope.

* Go to Plone Setup - Add/Remove Products and install CMFQuestionnaire.

* It may be needed that the default encoding of the Python interpreter
  is set to 'utf-8'.  You can achieve this by a putting a
  'sitecustomize.py' file into '.../lib/python2.4/' which contains::

  import sys

  sys.setdefaultencoding('utf-8')

Notes about Linux

  * Don't forget to install the
    "Reportlab Toolkit":http://www.reportlab.org/ if you want to
    generate PDF reports.

  * The code assumes that the Times fonts will be used in the
    PDF reports.  Just copy the files 'times.ttf' and 'timesi.ttf'
    into '.../lib/python2.4/site-packages/reportlab/fonts/'.

Notes about Windows

  * Basically, the Plone installer will install everything you need.

  * You will need to create the directory
    'C:\Program Files\Plone 2\lib\python\site-packages\reportlab\fonts'
    and put the '.ttf' files for the Times fonts there.

  * PDF report creation does not work at the moment.  I'll work on this
    issue later.

Changing the fonts used in the PDF report

  * Change the font file names in 'config.py'.  Remember to put the ttf
    files for the font you've selected into the reportlab fonts directory.
