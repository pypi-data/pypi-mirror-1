Description: Introduction
        ************
        
        
        The ``Plone Scholarly Journal`` (PSJ) is a collection of packages to
        create and maintain scholarly journals using Plone.
        
        The special abilities of PSJ are:
        
        * High quality on-the-fly transformations of office documents using
        OpenOffice.org.
        
        * Flexible metadata handling
        
        This package contains the content types and metadata handling.
        
        Currently, the whole thing consists of three packages:
        
        * ``psj.content`` (this package)
        
        * ``psj.policy`` (provides mainly office-document transformations using
        OpenOffice.org)
        
        * ``psj.site`` (kind of umbrella package for the other packages).
        
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        PSJ runs on Plone 3.x with Python 2.4.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        If you want to run a complete PSJ site, then you should use
        ``psj.site``, which will fetch all other needed packages
        automatically. ``psj.site`` comes also with extended installation
        notes.
        
        The whole installation process is driven by ``zc.buildout``.
        
        If you want to run this package alone, follow the follwing steps:
        
        1) Run `bootstrap.py`::
        
        $ python2.4 bootstrap/bootstrap.py
        
        This will create basic build scripts and directories.
        
        2) Run `buildout`::
        
        $ ./bin/buildout
        
        This will fetch all packages needed from the internet and install
        it locally. Also all scripts are created by this step.
        
        3) Start the server::
        
        $ ./bin/instance fg
        
        Now you can login on http://localhost:8080/manage. Default
        credentials are: username ``admin``, password ``admin``.
        
        You can change the credentials in ``buildout.cfg``.
        
        If you want to start the server in background, do::
        
        $ ./bin/instance start
        
        4) Stop the server by pressing CTRL-C on the commandline. If you
        started the server in background, do::
        
        
        $ ./bin/instance stop
        
        If you want to run the tests:
        
        5) Do the tests::
        
        $ ./bin/instance test -s psj.content
