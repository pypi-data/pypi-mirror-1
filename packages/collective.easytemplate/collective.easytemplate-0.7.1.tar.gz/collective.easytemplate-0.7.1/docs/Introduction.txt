Introduction
============

Easy Template (collective.easytemplate) products brings easy dynamic texts to Plone. 
You don't need to create full blown product just for few dynamic pages anymore - 
the most simplest things can be typed straight from the visual editor.

Templating is a way to add simple programming logic to text output. 
This products adds or enhances templating supports on various parts
of Plone site.

----------

Plone lacks out of the box support for custom, extensible, templating support for content editors.

Possible use cases are e.g.

* Adding dynamic listings and tables on pages, like news listing

* Adding dynamic email bodies, titles and receivers in content rules actions

* Adding generated content to content rule action emails

* Show different text to logged in and anonymous users

* Creating a simple text portlet dynamically

Example
-------

The following example demostrates how text in Templated Document edit mode gets translated to generated HTML snippet in the view mode.

You write in Kupu::

  Hello user!
  
  Please select one course from below:
  
  {{ list_folder("courses") }}
 
will result to the output:
