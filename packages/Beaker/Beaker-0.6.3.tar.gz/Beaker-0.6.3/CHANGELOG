Beaker Changelog
=================

0.6.3 (03/18/2007)
* Added api with customized Session that doesn't require a Myghty request 
  object, just a dict. Updated session to use the new version.
* Removing unicode keys as some dbm backends can't handle unicode keys.
* Adding core files that should've been here.
* More stringent checking for existence of a session.
* Avoid recreating the session object when it's empty.
