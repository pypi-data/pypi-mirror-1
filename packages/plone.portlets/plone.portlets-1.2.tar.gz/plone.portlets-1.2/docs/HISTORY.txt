Changelog for plone.portlets

    (name of developer listed in brackets)

plone.portlets - 1.2 - June 19th 2009

    - Fixed 'SyntaxError: non-keyword arg after keyword arg' in
      unicode call.
      [maurits]

    - Fix/workaround for http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8128
      (UnicodeDecodeError within _coerce() caused by external data
      with wrong encoding).
      [ajung]

    - Moved test-only dependencies to a test extra requirement.
      [hannosch]

    - Clarified license and copyright statements.
      [hannosch]

    - Specify package dependencies.
      [hannosch]

    - Replaced direct invocations of interfaces with queryAdapter calls. The
      former does a suboptimal getattr call internally.
      [hannosch]

plone.portlets - 1.1.0 - April 20th 2008

    - Ensure the keys stored in a portlet assignment mapping are always 
      unicode. This is necessary because an OOBTree will, once one unicode key
      has been added, force all keys to unicode. This can lead to unicode
      decode errors.
      Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6100

    - Changed a type() comparison into a isinstance comparison.
      [hannosch]

    - PLIPs 205 and 218: Allow registering portlet types to multiple portlet
      manager interfaces, require portlet types to be explicitly registered
      for portlet manager interfaces, enable modifying registrations through
      GenericSetup, and restrict most default Plone portlet types to left/
      right/dashboard columns.
      [sirgarr]
    
    - PLIP207: Allow custom portlet managers, i.e., allow specifying an
      alternative portlet manager class through GenericSetup.
      [sirgarr]
