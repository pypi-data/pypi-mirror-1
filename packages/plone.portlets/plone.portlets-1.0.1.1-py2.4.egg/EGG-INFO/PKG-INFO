Description: plone.portlets provides a generic infrastructure for managing portlets.
        Portlets are a bit like viewlets, except they can be manipulated at runtime,
        using local components. This package is used by plone.app.portlets to provide
        Plone-specific portlets, but should be generic enough to work on other
        platforms. It should work in a "pure Zope 3" environment.
