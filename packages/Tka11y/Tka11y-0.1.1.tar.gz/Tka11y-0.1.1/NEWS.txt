0.1.1  2009-03-25:
- Added emission of text, text attribute, value, and selection changes.
  - This enhancement is based on proposed changes to Papi, and therefore will
    not be realized until a new version of Papi (> 0.0.9) is released.
- Fixed reporting of text background color attribute for Entry and Spinbox
  widgets in the readonly state.
- Fixed some value interface bugs in Scale and Scrollbar.
- Fixed selection interface bugs in Listbox.
- Ensured Entry and Spinbox widgets have an empty name. In the previous
  version, the name was assigned the initial text contents of the widget, which
  didn't make much sense.
- Made some other minor bug fixes.

0.1.0  2009-03-02:
- Initial release.
