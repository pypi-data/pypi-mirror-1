Description: ====================================
        Tka11y - Accessibility-aware Tkinter
        ====================================
        
        This module makes it possible for accessibility (a11y) clients (e.g., audible
        readers, magnifiers, etc.) to get accessibility data (name, description,
        role, actions, etc.) from the Tk widgets of Python applications that
        use Tkinter_. It also allows automated GUI application testers that use the
        accessibility interface (such as dogtail_, LDTP_, and Accerciser_) to control
        the Tk widgets of these applications.
        
        Currently, accessibility is only available via ATK <=> AT-SPI on Linux.
        Sorry, no Windows MSAA support.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Import Tka11y using the two commonly employed methods for importing Tkinter::
        
        import Tka11y as Tkinter
        
        or ::
        
        from Tka11y import *
        
        In the first case, use ``Tkinter.`` to access Tkinter definitions.  In the
        second case, the Tkinter definitions are in the global scope as expected.
        In either case, use Tkinter definitions as you would have done before;
        Tka11y does not change the Tkinter API in any way.
        
        Details
        =======
        
        This module modifies the original Tkinter module in memory, making all
        Tk widgets accessibility-aware.
        
        Note that, because it modifies the original Tkinter module (in memory),
        other modules that use Tkinter (e.g., Pmw_) reap the benefits automagically
        as long as Tka11y is imported at some point before the first Tk object
        is created.
        
        Tka11y uses Papi_, the Python Accessibility Programming Interface, which in
        turn uses ATK_, the GNOME Accessibility Toolkit, to expose Tkinter_ widgets
        to AT-SPI, the Assistive Technologies Service Provider Interface. This
        allows a Tkinter application's widgets to be viewed and/or controlled by a
        variety of assistive technologies such as Orca_ and Accerciser_, and
        automated GUI testing tools such as dogtail_ and LDTP_. These client tools
        usually use either cspi_ (C) or pyatspi_ (Python).
