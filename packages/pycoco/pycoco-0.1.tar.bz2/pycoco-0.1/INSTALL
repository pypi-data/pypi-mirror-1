                     Requirements and installation
                     =============================

Requirements
============

   To use this module you need the following software packages:

    1. Python 2.4;
    2. ll-core (version 1.5 or later);
    3. XIST (version 2.15.1 or later).

Installation
============

   distutils is used for installation, so it's rather simple. Execute
   the following command:

 python setup.py install

   For Windows a binary distribution is provided. To install it,
   double click it and follow the instructions.

   setuptools is supported for installation, so if you have
   setuptools installed the package will be installed as an egg (and
   you can use easy_install for installation).

   If you have difficulties installing this software, send a problem
   report to Walter DÃ¶rwald (walter@livinglogic.de).

Configuration
=============

   In addition to the environment variables CC and CXX (which are
   used by Python's Makefile itself for the C and C++ compiler), you
   can set the environment variable COV to point to the coverage
   program (the default is gcov).

   You must create a directory run in your home directory, where
   pycoco will put its pid file (log files will be put into ~/log,
   but this directory will be created automatically).
