Description: Divisi is a library for reasoning by analogy and association over semantic networks,
        including common sense knowledge. Divisi uses a sparse higher-order SVD and can help
        find related concepts, features, and relation types in any knowledge base that can be
        represented as a semantic network. By including common sense knowledge from ConceptNet,
        the results can include relationships not expressed in the original data but related
        by common sense.
