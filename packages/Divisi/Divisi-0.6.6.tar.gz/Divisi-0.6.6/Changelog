Here's a pruned version of the history; the full history, including all
of our false starts and oops fixes, can be viewed through Bazaar or on
Launchpad.
	
295: Kenneth Arnold 2009-06-01 Normalized copy.
294: Kenneth Arnold 2009-06-01 FIX tensor .magnitude function. It previously returned the square of the magnitude.

292: Kenneth Arnold 2009-06-01 Eventually tensors should be constructable from nested lists, not just in the test harness. This is one step in that direction.
291: Kenneth Arnold 2009-06-01 Some test cleanups and improvements in documentation.
290: Kenneth Arnold 2009-06-01 Document and fix a corner case (empty DenseTensors).

Old SVN revision numbers:
r603 | kcarnold | A hopefully robust __setstate__ for DictTensors.
r598 | kcarnold | Move divisi.cnet to conceptnet.analogyspace. *REQUIRES NEW CSAMOA*. 
r591 | jayant | Incremental SVD
r587 | kcarnold | Rewrite layering logic so it's less brittle.
r567 | kcarnold | Add cmul for dense tensors, finally.
r566 | rspeer | added export_svdview
r545 | kcarnold | Improve adding tensors. Scalar addition now works.
r538 | kcarnold | tf-idf view.
r533 | kcarnold | Comprehensive Cython build and distribution fix.
r517 | jayant | Correction to the (u,v)_angles_to methods on the SVD object
r515 | rspeer | loads of documentation
r509 | kcarnold | Switch from epydoc to apydia. Thanks, Rob.
r504 | kcarnold | A reconstructed tensor that re-multiplies by the norms.
r472 | kcarnold | Reconstructed 2D tensor.
r469 | kcarnold | Deprecate the old SparseLabeledTensor classes in favor of constructor methods. This kills some functionality that should have been ported to the real tensor stack long ago.
r468 | kcarnold | An iterated version of outer_tuples; should be better for memory.
r447 | kcarnold | Common exceptions for Divisi.
r431 | kcarnold | Don't include zero entries in the sum.
r430 | kcarnold | Support adding tensors
r429 | kcarnold | Remove the unnecessary indexable_set
r422 | jayant | DictTensor slice optimization for slicing an entire row 
r421 | jayant | Modified DictTensor to store its items in nested dictionaries instead of one big dictionary with tuple keys. The change causes inserts to be 8% slower, but DictTensors use 40% less memory. 
r420 | kcarnold | Fix SVD results when we got fewer singular values than asked for.
r412 | jayant | Fixed a bug with DictTensor's tensordot function where it would not return a scalar
r411 | kcarnold | Make the Tensor getattr fallback more robust.
r410 | kcarnold | Low-hanging fruit for optimization.
r409 | kcarnold | Kill an ill-advised Abstract layer that is only slowing things down.
r408 | kcarnold | Separate Wikipedia stuff.
r407 | kcarnold | Update docs
r406 | kcarnold | Remove some legacy stuff
r404 | kcarnold | Remove unused PerspectiveSpace code.
r403 | kcarnold | _svdlib -> divisi._svdlib.
r399 | jayant | Made DictTensor slicing preserve the shape of the parent
r396 | jayant | added the combine_by_element method that allows you to combine two tensors element by element
r394 | kcarnold | Fix a serious long-standing normalization bug.
r392 | kcarnold | Default the identities to sqrt(5) for the ConceptNet tensor, so that the norms come out as expected.
r370 | jalonso | Repackage svdlibc using setuptools instead of autoconf.
r356 | kcarnold | Improve test framework.
r353 | kcarnold | Fix naming in ConceptNet: s/stem/concept/g
r352 | jayant | Added a method for iterating over the keys along one dimension of a tensor
r351 | jayant | Added a method to find the concepts near a specified feature
r350 | jmoeller | Changed slicing to be the exceptional case in DictTensor
r343 | kcarnold | rename ut to u in the SVD wrapper code.
r339 | rspeer | major fix: made normalized SVD actually work
r338 | rspeer | added demos
r337 | rspeer | Make getting an unknown element of a sparse tensor not fail.
r334 | kcarnold | Add methods for computing angles.
r333 | kcarnold | Provide a rudimentary division support in the base Tensor class. Subclasses can do better.
r332 | kcarnold | cnet: Handle polarity, and switch cutoff from a >= to a >
r321 | kcarnold | Take advantage of new queryset_refactor features to let Django make the query for us.
r317 | kcarnold | Support negating tensors.
r314 | kcarnold | Naming fixes in cnet
r301 | kcarnold | Make 2D explicit in the load functions.
r300 | kcarnold | Remove obsolete load/store functions. Use pickle/cPickle instead.
r299 | kcarnold | Remove ConceptNet2DTensor; everything is a bare function now. This incidentally removes load_cross_validation; maybe we'll restore that later.
r298 | kcarnold | Make normalization methods use separate classes
r297 | kcarnold | Generalize layering.
r296 | kcarnold | Add an "averaging" normalization
r295 | kcarnold | Make one csamoa dep optional.
r285 | | Inital public release
