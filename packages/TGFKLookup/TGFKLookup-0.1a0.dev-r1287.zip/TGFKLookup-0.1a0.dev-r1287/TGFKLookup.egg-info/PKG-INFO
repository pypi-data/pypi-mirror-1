Description: Still a work in progress.
        
        AutoCompletingFKLookupField, it's a prototype based
        rewrite of the autocompleting TG widget. It allows lookup by ID and text search
        and shows both fields. Check the widget browser for a demo.
        
        UpdatableSingleSelectField receives a function on the opt_feeder param
        and will setup a controller automagically to update it when the .update()
        javascript method from the manager is called. I'm currently using it to make options
        lists based on other fields.
        Also takes a predicate if you want to protect the Ajax calls. Demo coming soon.
