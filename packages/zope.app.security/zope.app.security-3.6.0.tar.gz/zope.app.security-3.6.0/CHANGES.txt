3.6.0 (2009-01-31)
------------------

- Changed mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org, because
  zope3-dev is retired now. Changed "cheeseshop" to "pypi" in
  the package homepage.

- Moved the `protectclass` module to `zope.security` leaving only a
  compatibility module here that imports from the new location.

- Moved the <module> directive implementation to `zope.security`.

- Use `zope.container` instead of `zope.app.container`;.

3.5.3 (2008-12-11)
------------------

- use zope.browser.interfaces.ITerms instead of
  `zope.app.form.browser.interfaces`.

3.5.2 (2008-07-31)
------------------

- Bug: It turned out that checking for regex was not much better of an
  idea, since it causes deprecation warnings in Python 2.4. Thus let's
  look for a library that was added in Python 2.5.

3.5.1 (2008-06-24)
------------------

- Bug: The `gopherlib` module has been deprecated in Python 2.5. Whenever the
  ZCML of this package was included when using Python 2.5, a deprecation
  warning had been raised stating that `gopherlib` has been
  deprecated. Provided a simple condition to check whether Python 2.5 or later
  is installed by checking for the deleted `regex` module and thus optionally
  load the security declaration for `gopherlib`.

3.5.0 (2008-02-05)
------------------

- Feature:
  `zope.app.security.principalregistry.PrincipalRegistry.getPrincipal` returns
  `zope.security.management.system_user` when its id is used for the search
  key.

3.4.0 (2007-10-27)
------------------

- Initial release independent of the main Zope tree.
