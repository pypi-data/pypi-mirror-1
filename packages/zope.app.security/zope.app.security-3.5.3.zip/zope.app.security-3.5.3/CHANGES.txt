3.5.3 (2008-12-11)
---------------------

- use zope.browser.interfaces.ITerms instead of zope.app.form.browser.interfaces

3.5.2 (2008-07-31)
------------------

- Bug: It turned out that checking for regex was not much better of an idea,
  since it causes deprecation warnings in Python 2.4. Thus let's look for a
  library that was added in Python 2.5.

3.5.1 (2008-06-24)
------------------

- Bug: The `gopherlib` module has been deprecated in Python 2.5. Whenever the
  ZCML of this package was included when using Python 2.5, a deprecation
  warning had been raised stating that `gopherlib` has been
  deprecated. Provided a simple condition to check whether Python 2.5 or later
  is installed by checking for the deleted `regex` module and thus optionally
  load the security declaration for `gopherlib`.

3.5.0 (2008-02-05)
------------------

- Feature:
  `zope.app.security.principalregistry.PrincipalRegistry.getPrincipal` returns
  `zope.security.management.system_user` when its id is used for the search
  key.

3.4.0 (2007-10-27)
------------------

- Initial release independent of the main Zope tree.
