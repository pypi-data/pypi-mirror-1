Description: GetPaid Salesforce Order Recorder
        ============================================
        
        Overview
        ========
        
        --- Need to flesh this out ---
        
        Allows for the storage of getpaid orders to salesforce.  Must be configured in the admin console before it will work.  User must specify the content type they are interested in and give instructions on how to map it to salesforce.  If that content type appears in a charged order the entire order is saved to salesforce (even if there are other content types)
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        Depends upon the beatbox library >= 0.9.1.1, which is a Python wrapper to the
        Salesforce.com API (version 7.0).  You must have a Salesforce.com account
        that provides API access.
        
        To download and install beatbox, please visit::
        
        http://code.google.com/p/salesforce-beatbox/
        
        SalesforceBaseConnector >= 1.0a3. See
