Description: tgmigrate is an turbogears command extension which provide sqlalchemy migrate support.
        http://erosson.com/migrate/
        The first version of tgmigrate gives turbogears developers a quick evaluation if sqlalchemy migrate is helpful for us.
        
        
        Install
        ----------------
        easy_install tgmigrate
        
        
        Usage
        ----------------
        
        After install, tgmigrate plug an "migrate" command into tg-admin console utility.
        
        The basic syntax is ::
        
        tg-admin migrate [command]
        
        tgmigrate takes care the dburi and repository name for you.
        
        The reference procedure is:
        
        1. quickstart project as usual::
        
        $ tg-admin quickstart -i -s demo
        
        2. setup sqlalchemy dburi in demo/dev.cfg
        
        3. create initial database
        
        $ tg-admin sql create
        
        4. create repository "migration"
        
        $ tg-admin migrate create
        
        note the default repository folder named "migration" is created in your project folder.
        
        5. move your database to version control
        
        $ tg-admin migrate version_control
        
        or briefly:
        
        $ tg-admin migrate vc
        
        6. Now you could watch the current version in both database and repository
        
        show repository version::
        
        $ tg-admin migrate v
        (tg-admin migrate version)
        
        show database version::
        
        $ tg-admin migrate dbv
        (tg-admin migrate db_version)
        
        then follow the migration doc http://erosson.com/migrate/docs/versioning.html to do the further stuff.
        
        I must confess that at this time I havn't go through the further stuff in the doc, so if you found sqlalchemy migrate is helpful,
        please let me know. (say something back to TurboGears google group http://groups.google.com/group/turbogears)
        
        
        reference
        --------------
        Available commands are

        Caution
        ------------
        It's an evaluation build, the project propose is giving turbogears developers a quick evaluation for sqlalchemy migrate function,
        It's no harm for you, but no further support guaranteed.
