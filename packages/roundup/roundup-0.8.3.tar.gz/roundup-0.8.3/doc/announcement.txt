Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with
command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design
from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.

This 0.8.3 release adds one feature and fixes some bugs:

Feature:
- chinese translation by limodou

Fixed:
- fix reference to The Zope Book in Roundup FAQ
- disabled file logging in Roundup test suite (sf bug 1155649)
- return original string if message issue xref isn't valid
- fix nosyreaction.py to stop it setting the nosy list unnecessarily
  (see doc/upgrading.txt for how to fix in your trackers)
- after logout, always display tracker home page
- web forms don't create new items if no item properties are set from UI
- item creation failed if multilink fields had invalid entries (sf bug
  1177602)
- fix bdist_rpm (sf bug 1164328)
- fix checking of "Email Access" for Anonymous email registration (sf bug
  1177057)
- disable "Email Access" for Anonymous by default to stop spam regsitering
  users on public trackers
- send errors in the web interface to a logfile by default. Use the
  "debug" multiprocess mode (roundup-server) or the DEBUG_TO_CLIENT var
  (roundup.cgi) to have the errors appear in your browser
- fix setgid typo (sf bug 1171346)
- fix faulty find_template filename facility (sf bug 1163629)
- fix roundup-admin "export" so it creates the target dir if needed
- "fix" roundup-admin "import" to not use "universal newline support" since
  the csv module appears to have its own ideas about such things (sf bug
  1163890)
- fix installation docs referring to old-style configuration variables

About Roundup
=============

Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties such as
"description", "priority", and so on) and provides the ability to:

(a) submit new issues,
(b) find and edit existing issues, and
(c) discuss issues with other participants.

The system will facilitate communication among the participants by managing
discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are edited. One of
the major design goals for Roundup that it be simple to get going. Roundup
is therefore usable "out of the box" with any python 2.3+ installation. It
doesn't even need to be "installed" to be operational, though a
disutils-based install script is provided.

It comes with two issue tracker templates (a classic bug/feature tracker and
a minimal skeleton) and five database back-ends (anydbm, sqlite, metakit,
mysql and postgresql).
