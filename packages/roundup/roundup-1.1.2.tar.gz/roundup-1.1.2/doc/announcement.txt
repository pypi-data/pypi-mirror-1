I'm proud to release version 1.1.2 of Roundup.

Feature:

- server-ctl script uses server configuration file (sf bug 1443805)

Fixed:

- indexing may be turned off for FileClass "content" now

  FileClass schema where previously the "content" property was faked and
  "type" was optional)
- reduced frequency of session timestamp update
- progress display in roundup-admin reindex
- bug in menu() permission filter (sf bug 1444440)
- verbose output during import is optional now (sf bug 1475624)
- escape *all* uses of "schema" in mysql backend (sf bug 1472120)
- responses to user rego email (sf bug 1470254)
- dangling connections in session handling (sf bug 1463359)
- classhelp popup pagination forgot about "type" (sf bug 1465836)
- umask is now configurable (with the same 0002 default)
- sorting of entries in classhelp popup (sf bug 1449000)
- allow single digit seconds in date spec (sf bug 1447141)
- prevent generation of new single-digit seconds dates (sf bug 1429390)
- implement close() on all indexers (sf bug 1242477)

About Roundup
=============

Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with
command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design
from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.

Note: Ping is not responsible for this project. The contact for this
project is richard@users.sourceforge.net.

Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties such as
"description", "priority", and so on) and provides the ability to:

(a) submit new issues,
(b) find and edit existing issues, and
(c) discuss issues with other participants.

The system will facilitate communication among the participants by managing
discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are edited. One of
the major design goals for Roundup that it be simple to get going. Roundup
is therefore usable "out of the box" with any python 2.3+ installation. It
doesn't even need to be "installed" to be operational, though a
disutils-based install script is provided.

It comes with two issue tracker templates (a classic bug/feature tracker and
a minimal skeleton) and five database back-ends (anydbm, sqlite, metakit,
mysql and postgresql).
