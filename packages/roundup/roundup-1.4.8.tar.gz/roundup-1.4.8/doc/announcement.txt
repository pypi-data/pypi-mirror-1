I'm proud to release version 1.4.8 of Roundup.

This release fixes some regressions:

- bug introduced into hyperdb filter (issue 2550505)
- bug introduced into CVS export and view (issue 2550529)
- bugs introduced in the migration to the email package (issue 2550531)

And adds a couple of other fixes:

- handle bogus pagination values (issue 2550530)
- fix TLS handling with some SMTP servers (issues 2484879 and 1912923)


Though some new features made it in also:

- Provide a "no selection" option in web interface selection widgets
- Debug logging now uses the logging module rather than print
- Allow CGI frontend to serve XMLRPC requests.
- Added XMLRPC actions, as well as bridging CGI actions to XMLRPC actions.
- Optimized large file serving via mod_python / sendfile().
- Support resuming downloads for (large) files.

If you're upgrading from an older version of Roundup you *must* follow
the "Software Upgrade" guidelines given in the maintenance documentation.

Roundup requires python 2.3 or later for correct operation.

To give Roundup a try, just download (see below), unpack and run::

About Roundup
=============

Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with
command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design
from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.

Note: Ping is not responsible for this project. The contact for this
project is richard@users.sourceforge.net.

Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties such as
"description", "priority", and so on) and provides the ability to:

(a) submit new issues,
(b) find and edit existing issues, and
(c) discuss issues with other participants.

The system will facilitate communication among the participants by managing
discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are edited. One of
the major design goals for Roundup that it be simple to get going. Roundup
is therefore usable "out of the box" with any python 2.3+ installation. It
doesn't even need to be "installed" to be operational, though a
disutils-based install script is provided.

It comes with two issue tracker templates (a classic bug/feature tracker and
a minimal skeleton) and four database back-ends (anydbm, sqlite, mysql
and postgresql).
