        About Roundup
        =============
        
        Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with
        command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design
        from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.
        
        Note: Ping is not responsible for this project. The contact for this
        project is richard@users.sourceforge.net.
        
        Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties such as
        "description", "priority", and so on) and provides the ability to:
        
        (a) submit new issues,
        (b) find and edit existing issues, and
        (c) discuss issues with other participants.
        
        The system will facilitate communication among the participants by managing
        discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are edited. One of
        the major design goals for Roundup that it be simple to get going. Roundup
        is therefore usable "out of the box" with any python 2.3+ installation. It
        doesn't even need to be "installed" to be operational, though a
        disutils-based install script is provided.
        
        It comes with two issue tracker templates (a classic bug/feature tracker and
        a minimal skeleton) and five database back-ends (anydbm, sqlite, metakit,
        mysql and postgresql).
