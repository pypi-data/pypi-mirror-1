I'm proud to release version 1.4.12 of Roundup which fixes a number bugs.

If you're upgrading from an older version of Roundup you *must* follow
the "Software Upgrade" guidelines given in the maintenance documentation.

This release includes:

- Support IMAP CRAM-MD5, thanks Jochen Maes
- Proper handling of 'Create' permissions in both mail gateway (earlier
  commit r4405 by Richard), web interface, and xmlrpc. This used to
  check 'Edit' permission previously. See

  Add regression tests for proper handling of 'Create' and 'Edit'
  permissions.
- Fix handling of non-ascii in realname in the nosy mailer, this used to
  mangle the email address making it unusable when replying. Thanks to
  intevation for funding the fix.

  issue2550618, thanks to Chris aka 'radioking'

About Roundup
=============

Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with
command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design
from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.

Note: Ping is not responsible for this project. The contact for this
project is richard@users.sourceforge.net.

Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties such as
"description", "priority", and so on) and provides the ability to:

(a) submit new issues,
(b) find and edit existing issues, and
(c) discuss issues with other participants.

The system will facilitate communication among the participants by managing
discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are edited. One of
the major design goals for Roundup that it be simple to get going. Roundup
is therefore usable "out of the box" with any python 2.3+ (but not 3+)
installation. It doesn't even need to be "installed" to be operational,
though an install script is provided.

It comes with two issue tracker templates (a classic bug/feature tracker and
a minimal skeleton) and four database back-ends (anydbm, sqlite, mysql
and postgresql).
