Description: Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with
        command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design
        from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.
        
        If you're upgrading from an older version of Roundup you *must* follow
        the "Software Upgrade" guidelines given in the maintenance documentation.
        
        Roundup 0.9 includes:
        
        - added "imapServer.py" script (sf patch 934567)
        - added date selection popup windows (thanks Marcus Priesch)
        - added Xapian indexer; replaces standard indexers if Xapian is available*
        - mailgw subject parsing has configurable levels of strictness
        - nosy messages may be sent individually to all recipients
        - remember where we came from when logging in (sf patch 1312889)
        
        *: unfortunately the latest release of Xapian (0.9.2) has a bug in the
        Python bindings which prevents this indexer from working, so it's disabled
