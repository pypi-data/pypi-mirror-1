I'm proud to release this 9th major feature release of Roundup.

First up, big thanks go to alexander smishlajev who has done some really
good work getting the i18n and new configuration components of this release
going.

Please note that Roundup now requires python 2.3 or later.

Roundup 0.9 includes:

- added "imapServer.py" script (sf patch 934567)
- added date selection popup windows (thanks Marcus Priesch)
- added Xapian indexer; replaces standard indexers if Xapian is available*
- mailgw subject parsing has configurable levels of strictness
- nosy messages may be sent individually to all recipients
- remember where we came from when logging in (sf patch 1312889)

*: unfortunately the latest release of Xapian (0.9.2) has a bug in the
Python bindings which prevents this indexer from working, so it's disabled

If you're upgrading from an older version of Roundup you *must* follow
the "Software Upgrade" guidelines given in the maintenance documentation.

Roundup requires python 2.3 or later for correct operation.

To give Roundup a try, just download (see below), unpack and run::

    python demo.py

About Roundup
=============

Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with
command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design
from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.

Note: Ping is not responsible for this project. The contact for this
project is richard@users.sourceforge.net.

Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties such as
"description", "priority", and so on) and provides the ability to:

(a) submit new issues,
(b) find and edit existing issues, and
(c) discuss issues with other participants.

The system will facilitate communication among the participants by managing
discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are edited. One of
the major design goals for Roundup that it be simple to get going. Roundup
is therefore usable "out of the box" with any python 2.3+ installation. It
doesn't even need to be "installed" to be operational, though a
disutils-based install script is provided.

It comes with two issue tracker templates (a classic bug/feature tracker and
a minimal skeleton) and five database back-ends (anydbm, sqlite, metakit,
mysql and postgresql).
