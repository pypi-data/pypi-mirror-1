Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with
command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design
from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.

This 0.8.2 release adds one feature and fixes some bugs:

Feature:

- roundup-server automatically redirects from trackers list
  to the tracker page if there is only one tracker

Fixed:

- added content to ZRoundup refresh.txt file (sf bug 1147622)
- fix invalid reference to csv.colon_separated
- correct URL to What's New in setup.py meta-data
- change AUTOCOMMIT=OFF to AUTOCOMMIT=0 for MySQL (sf bug 1143707)
- compile message objects in 'setup.py build'
- use backend datatype for journal timestamps in RDBMSes
- fixes to the "Using an external password validation source"
  customisation example (sf bugs 1153640 and 1155108)

If you're upgrading from an older version of Roundup you *must* follow
the "Software Upgrade" guidelines given in the maintenance documentation.

Roundup requires python 2.3 or later for correct operation.

About Roundup
=============

Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties such as
"description", "priority", and so on) and provides the ability to:

(a) submit new issues,
(b) find and edit existing issues, and
(c) discuss issues with other participants.

The system will facilitate communication among the participants by managing
discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are edited. One of
the major design goals for Roundup that it be simple to get going. Roundup
is therefore usable "out of the box" with any python 2.3+ installation. It
doesn't even need to be "installed" to be operational, though a
disutils-based install script is provided.

It comes with two issue tracker templates (a classic bug/feature tracker and
a minimal skeleton) and five database back-ends (anydbm, sqlite, metakit,
mysql and postgresql).
