Description: This version of Roundup fixes some bugs:
        
        - Minor update of doc/developers.txt to point to the new resources
        on www.roundup-tracker.org (Bernhard Reiter)
        - Small CSS improvements regaring the search box (thanks Thomas Arendsan Hein)
        (issue 2550589)
        - Indexers behaviour made more consistent regarding length of indexed words
        and stopwords (thanks Thomas Arendsen Hein, Bernhard Reiter)(issue 2550584)
        - fixed typos in the installation instructions (thanks Thomas Arendsen Hein)
        (issue 2550573)
        - New config option csv_field_size: Pythons csv module (which is used
        for export/import) has a new field size limit starting with python2.5.
        We now issue a warning during export if the limit is too small and use
        the csv_field_size configuration during import to set the limit for
        the csv module.
        - Small fix for CGI-handling of XMLRPC requests for python2.4, this
        worked only for 2.5 and beyond due to a change in the xmlrpc interface
        in python
        - Document filter method of xmlrpc interface
        - Fix interaction of SSL and XMLRPC, now XMLRPC works with SSL
        
        If you're upgrading from an older version of Roundup you *must* follow
        the "Software Upgrade" guidelines given in the maintenance documentation.
        
        Roundup requires python 2.3 or later (but not 3+) for correct operation.
        
        To give Roundup a try, just download (see below), unpack and run::

        About Roundup
        =============
        
        Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with
        command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design
        from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.
        
        Note: Ping is not responsible for this project. The contact for this
        project is richard@users.sourceforge.net.
        
        Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties such as
        "description", "priority", and so on) and provides the ability to:
        
        (a) submit new issues,
        (b) find and edit existing issues, and
        (c) discuss issues with other participants.
        
        The system will facilitate communication among the participants by managing
        discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are edited. One of
        the major design goals for Roundup that it be simple to get going. Roundup
        is therefore usable "out of the box" with any python 2.3+ (but not 3+)
        installation. It doesn't even need to be "installed" to be operational,
        though an install script is provided.
        
        It comes with two issue tracker templates (a classic bug/feature tracker and
        a minimal skeleton) and five database back-ends (anydbm, sqlite, metakit,
        mysql and postgresql).
