Debugging Flags
---------------

Roundup uses a number of debugging environment variables to help you
figure out what the heck it's doing. 

HYPERDBDEBUG 
============

This environment variable should be set to a filename - the hyperdb will
write debugging information for various events (including, for instance,
the SQL used).

This is only obeyed when python is _not_ running in -O mode. 

HYPERDBTRACE
============

This environment variable should be set to a filename - the hyperdb will
write a timestamp entry for various events. This appears to be suffering
rather extreme bit-rot and may go away soon.

This is only obeyed when python is _not_ running in -O mode. 

SENDMAILDEBUG
=============

Set to a filename and roundup will write a copy of each email message
that it sends to that file. This environment variable is independent of
the python -O flag.
