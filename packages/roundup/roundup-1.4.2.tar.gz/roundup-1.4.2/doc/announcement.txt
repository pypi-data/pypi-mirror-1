I'm proud to release version 1.4.2 of Roundup.

New Features in 1.4.2:
- New config option in mail section: ignore_alternatives allows to
  ignore alternatives besides the text/plain part used for the content
  of a message in multipart/alternative attachments.
- Admin copy of error email from mailgw includes traceback (thanks Ulrik
  Mikaelsson)
- Messages created through the web are now given an in-reply-to header
  when email out to nosy (thanks Martin v. Löwis)
- Nosy messages now include more information about issues (all link
  properties with a "name" attribute) (thanks Martin v. Löwis)

And things fixed:
- Searching date range by supplying just a date as the filter spec
- Handle no time.tzset under Windows (sf #1825643)
- Fix race condition in file storage transaction commit (sf #1883580)

If you're upgrading from an older version of Roundup you *must* follow
the "Software Upgrade" guidelines given in the maintenance documentation.

Roundup requires python 2.3 or later for correct operation.

About Roundup
=============

Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with
command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design
from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.

Note: Ping is not responsible for this project. The contact for this
project is richard@users.sourceforge.net.

Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties such as
"description", "priority", and so on) and provides the ability to:

(a) submit new issues,
(b) find and edit existing issues, and
(c) discuss issues with other participants.

The system will facilitate communication among the participants by managing
discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are edited. One of
the major design goals for Roundup that it be simple to get going. Roundup
is therefore usable "out of the box" with any python 2.3+ installation. It
doesn't even need to be "installed" to be operational, though a
disutils-based install script is provided.

It comes with two issue tracker templates (a classic bug/feature tracker and
a minimal skeleton) and four database back-ends (anydbm, sqlite, mysql
and postgresql).
