Description: Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with
        command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design
        from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.
        
        
        This 0.8.3 release adds one feature and fixes some bugs:
        
        Feature:
        
        - chinese translation by limodou
        
        Fixed:
        
        - fix reference to The Zope Book in Roundup FAQ
        - disabled file logging in Roundup test suite (sf bug 1155649)
        - return original string if message issue xref isn't valid
        - fix nosyreaction.py to stop it setting the nosy list unnecessarily
        (see doc/upgrading.txt for how to fix in your trackers)
        - after logout, always display tracker home page
        - web forms don't create new items if no item properties are set from UI
        - item creation failed if multilink fields had invalid entries (sf bug
        1177602)
        - fix bdist_rpm (sf bug 1164328)
        - fix checking of "Email Access" for Anonymous email registration (sf bug
        1177057)
        - disable "Email Access" for Anonymous by default to stop spam regsitering
        users on public trackers
        - send errors in the web interface to a logfile by default. Use the
        "debug" multiprocess mode (roundup-server) or the DEBUG_TO_CLIENT var
        (roundup.cgi) to have the errors appear in your browser
        - fix setgid typo (sf bug 1171346)
        - fix faulty find_template filename facility (sf bug 1163629)
        - fix roundup-admin "export" so it creates the target dir if needed
        - "fix" roundup-admin "import" to not use "universal newline support" since
        the csv module appears to have its own ideas about such things (sf bug
        1163890)
        - fix installation docs referring to old-style configuration variables
        
        If you're upgrading from an older version of Roundup you *must* follow
        the "Software Upgrade" guidelines given in the maintenance documentation.
