\fBname=\fP\fItracker home\fP
Sets the tracker home(s) to use. The name is how the tracker is
identified in the URL (it's the first part of the URL path). The
tracker home is the directory that was identified when you did
"roundup-admin init". You may specify any number of these name=home
pairs on the command-line. For convenience, you may edit the
TRACKER_HOMES variable in the roundup-server file instead.
Make sure the name part doesn't include any url-unsafe characters like
spaces, as these confuse the cookie handling in browsers like IE.
