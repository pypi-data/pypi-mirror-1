Tasks
=====

Maintenance of Roundup can involve one of the following:

1. `tracker backup`_ 
2. `software upgrade`_
3. `migrating backends`_


Tracker Backup
==============

Stop the web and email frontends and to copy the contents of the tracker home
directory to some other place using standard backup tools.

Software Upgrade
================

Always make a backup of your tracker before upgrading software. Steps you may
take:

1. ensure that the unit tests run on your system
2. copy your tracker home to a new directory
3. follow the steps in the upgrading documentation for the new version of
   the software
4. test each of the admin tool, web interface and mail gateway using the new
   version of the software
5. stop the production web and email frontends
6. perform the upgrade steps on the existing tracker directory
7. upgrade the software
8. restart your tracker

Migrating Backends
==================


1. stop the existing tracker web and email frontends (preventing changes)
2. use the roundup-admin tool "export" command to export the contents of
   your tracker to disk
3. copy the tracker home to a new directory
4. change the backend used in the tracker home ``select_db.py`` file
5. delete the "db" directory from the new directory
6. use the roundup-admin "import" command to import the previous export with
   the new tracker home
7. test each of the admin tool, web interface and mail gateway using the new
   backend
8. move the old tracker home out of the way (rename to "tracker.old") and 
   move the new tracker home into its place
9. restart web and email frontends


Moving a Tracker
================

If you're moving the tracker to a similar machine, you should:

1. install Roundup on the new machine and test that it works there,
2. stop the existing tracker web and email frontends (preventing changes),
3. copy the tracker home directory over to the new machine, and
4. start the tracker web and email frontends on the new machine.

Most of the backends are actually portable across platforms (ie. from Unix to
Windows to Mac). If this isn't the case (ie. the tracker doesn't work when
moved using the above steps) then you'll need to:

1. install Roundup on the new machine and test that it works there,
2. stop the existing tracker web and email frontends (preventing changes),
3. use the roundup-admin tool "export" command to export the contents of
   the existing tracker,
4. copy the export to the new machine,
5. use the roundup-admin "import" command to import the tracker on the new
   machine, and
6. start the tracker web and email frontends on the new machine.
