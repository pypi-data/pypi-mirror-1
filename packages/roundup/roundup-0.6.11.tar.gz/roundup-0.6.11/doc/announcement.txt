release.

or later is strongly recommended.

About Roundup
=============

Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with
command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning
design from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design
competition.

Note: Ping is not responsible for this project. The contact for this
project is richard@users.sourceforge.net.

Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties such as
"description", "priority", and so on) and provides the ability to:

(a) submit new issues,
(b) find and edit existing issues, and
(c) discuss issues with other participants.

The system will facilitate communication among the participants by
managing discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are
edited. One of the major design goals for Roundup that it be simple to
get going. Roundup is therefore usable "out of the box" with any python
2.1+ installation. It doesn't even need to be "installed" to be
operational, though a disutils-based install script is provided.

It comes with two issue tracker templates (a classic bug/feature tracker
and a minimal skeleton) and six database back-ends (anydbm, bsddb, bsddb3,
sqlite, metakit and mysql).
