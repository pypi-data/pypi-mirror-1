I'm proud to release this, the 1.1.0 release of Roundup.

Feature:

- trackers may configure custom stop-words for the full-text indexer
- login may now be for a single session (and this is the default)
- trackers may hide exceptions from web users (they will be mailed to the
  tracker admin) (hiding is the default)
- include "clear this message" link in the "ok" message bar

Fixed:

- fixes in scripts/import_sf.py
- fix some unicode bugs in roundup-admin import
- Xapian indexer wasn't actually being used and its reindexing of existing
  data was busted to boot
- roundup-admin import wasn't indexing message content
- allow dispname to be passed to renderWith (sf bug 1424587)
- rename dispname to @dispname to avoid name clashes in the future
- fixed schema migration problem when Class keys were removed

If you're upgrading from an older version of Roundup you *must* follow
the "Software Upgrade" guidelines given in the maintenance documentation.

Roundup requires python 2.3 or later for correct operation.

About Roundup
=============

Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with
command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design
from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.

Note: Ping is not responsible for this project. The contact for this
project is richard@users.sourceforge.net.

Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties such as
"description", "priority", and so on) and provides the ability to:

(a) submit new issues,
(b) find and edit existing issues, and
(c) discuss issues with other participants.

The system will facilitate communication among the participants by managing
discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are edited. One of
the major design goals for Roundup that it be simple to get going. Roundup
is therefore usable "out of the box" with any python 2.3+ installation. It
doesn't even need to be "installed" to be operational, though a
disutils-based install script is provided.

It comes with two issue tracker templates (a classic bug/feature tracker and
a minimal skeleton) and five database back-ends (anydbm, sqlite, metakit,
mysql and postgresql).
