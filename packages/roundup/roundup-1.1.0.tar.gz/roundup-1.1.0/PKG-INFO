Description: Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with
        command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design
        from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.
        
        If you're upgrading from an older version of Roundup you *must* follow
        the "Software Upgrade" guidelines given in the maintenance documentation.
        
        Feature:
        
        - trackers may configure custom stop-words for the full-text indexer
        - login may now be for a single session (and this is the default)
        - trackers may hide exceptions from web users (they will be mailed to the
        tracker admin) (hiding is the default)
        - include "clear this message" link in the "ok" message bar
        
        Fixed:
        
        - fixes in scripts/import_sf.py
        - fix some unicode bugs in roundup-admin import
        - Xapian indexer wasn't actually being used and its reindexing of existing
        data was busted to boot
        - roundup-admin import wasn't indexing message content
        - allow dispname to be passed to renderWith (sf bug 1424587)
        - rename dispname to @dispname to avoid name clashes in the future
        - fixed schema migration problem when Class keys were removed
