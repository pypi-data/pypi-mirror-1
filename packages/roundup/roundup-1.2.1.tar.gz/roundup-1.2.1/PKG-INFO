Description: Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with
        command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design
        from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.
        
        If you're upgrading from an older version of Roundup you *must* follow
        the "Software Upgrade" guidelines given in the maintenance documentation.
        
        Bugs fixed in 1.2.1:
        
        - E-mail subject line prefix delimiter configuration was being ignored.
        - Password confirm field in user editing.

        - supports Python 2.5, including the sqlite3 module
        - full timezone support (sf patch 1465296)
        - handle connection loss when responding to web requests
        - match incoming mail In-Reply-To against existing messages when no issue
        id is specified in the Subject
        - added StringHTMLProperty wrapped() method to wrap long lines in issue
        display
        - include the popcal in Date field editing and search fields by default
        - @required in forms may now specify properties of linked items (sf patch
        1507093)
        - update for latest version of pysqlite (sf bug 1487098; patch 1534227)

        - new "exporttables" command in roundup-admin (sf bug 1533791)

        - sorting and grouping by multiple properties is now supported by the
        backends *and* the classic template.
        - sorting, grouping, and searching by transitive properties (e.g.,
        messages.author.supervisor) is now supported in all backends
        - added filter_sql to SQL backends which takes an arbitrary SQL statement
        and returns a list of item ids
        
        There was also a lot of bugfixes - see the bundled CHANGES.txt file for the
        list.
