Preparation tasks
-----------------------
1. Install Python
Get the ActiveState Python distribution, either 2.2.3b227 or 2.3.2b232, it includes the win32 extensions:
http://www.activestate.com/Products/Download/Download.plex?id=ActivePython
Install Python to a directory without spaces like c:\Programs\Python22 (or Python 23)

2. Install SQLite
Get the Windows installation package for SQLite (beware of differences depending on Python version):
For Python 2.2:
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/pysqlite/pysqlite-0.5.0.win32-py2.2.exe?download
For Python 2.3:
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/pysqlite/pysqlite-0.5.0.win32-py2.3.exe?download

3. Install the CSV parser
Roundup uses a special package called CSV, for Python 2.3 it is included but for Python 2.2
it can be retrieved here:
http://www.object-craft.com.au/projects/csv/download/py22/csv.pyd
After downloading this file you need just coopy it into the <pythoninstalldir>\lib\site-packages folder.


Getting Roundup
------------------------
It is recommended at this moment to use the 0.6 version (0.7 is the bleeding edge devlopment version...)
The best way to get it is via CVS checkout from branch maint-0-6:
CVS homepage:  http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=31577

Checkout details:
CVSROOT = :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/roundup
Login password = <empty>
Module to get = roundup
Tag to get = maint-0-6

Checkout command:
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/roundup co -r maint-0-6 roundup

It is also possible to download the file archive for release 0.6.7:
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/roundup/roundup-0.6.7.tar.gz?download
This will get you a tar.gz archive that needs unpacking (using WinZip)

Installing Roundup
------------------------
There are a lot of documentation available on how to install and configure Roundup.
You can start reading here:
http://roundup.sourceforge.net/
http://roundup.sourceforge.net/doc-0.6/index.html
http://roundup.sourceforge.net/doc-0.6/installation.html
http://roundup.sourceforge.net/doc-0.6/customizing.html
http://roundup.sourceforge.net/doc-0.6/user_guide.html
http://roundup.sourceforge.net/doc-0.6/maintenance.html

I have found the following steps beneficial:

1. On a command prompt go to the top of the checked out or downloaded file tree

2. Issue command "python ./run_tests" and watch the result screen. It will take a few minutes. No errors allowed.

3. Issue command "python setup.py install" and wait until completion

4. Now all Roundup files will have been copied and compiled into the Python install file tree, so the
   sources are no longer needed.

5. Create a directory for your tracker somewhere, suggestion: c:\Roundup\Trackers\Test

6. Move the command prompt to <pythondir>\scripts. You will find these batch files there:
   roundup-server.bat   (this is the file that actually controls the server operations)
   roundup-admin.bat    (this file is used to create/modify trackers)
   roundup-mailgw.bat   (this is used to retrieve email for roundup incoming mail functions)

7. Issue command "roundup-admin install"  there will be a number of prompts to respond to:
   Enter tracker home: c:\Roundup\Trackers\Test
   Templates: classic
   Select template [classic]: classic
   Back ends: anydbm, bsddb, sqlite
   Select backend [anydbm]: sqlite

8. Now you must go to c:\Roundup\Trackers\Test and edit the config.py file located there in order
   to define your tracker. Edit the following variables:
   MAILHOST = '123.123.123.123'   (set to the IP address of your SMTP mail host
   MAIL_DOMAIN = somedomain.com'  (set to the domain your users are on, mail goes to user@MAIL_DOMAIN)
   TRACKER_NAME = 'Test issue tracker'  (this is the name that will appear as title on the web pages)
   TRACKER_EMAIL = 'issue_tracker@%s'%MAIL_DOMAIN  (issue_tracker is the name of the mail account set aside for the tracker itself)
   TRACKER_WEB = 'http://roundupserver:8080/test/' (this is the URL the tracker will live at)
   ADMIN_EMAIL = 'your.name@%s'%MAIL_DOMAIN  (When roundup gets into trouble it complains here)

   You can set other stuff as well, but the above is OK for now.

9. When all of the above is done you run this one-time command:
   roundup-admin initialise
   You will be asked for some info as follows:
   Enter tracker home:  c:\Roundup\Trackers\Test
   Admin Password: <yourpassword>
          Confirm: <yourpassword>

10. Now the tracker is set up, only remaining task is to start and check what it looks like.
    To make the tracker a Windows service so it is always accessible you must first edit the file:
    <pythondir>\Lib\site-packages\roundup\scripts\roundup_server.py
    The following values must be edited:
    TRACKER_HOMES = { 'Test': 'C:/Roundup/Trackers/Test' }
    ROUNDUP_LOG_IP = 1
    PORT = 8080
    LOGFILE = 'C:/Roundup/Trackers/Logs/TrackerWeb.log'

11. Make sure you have created the directory for the logfiles C:/Roundup/Trackers/Logs

12. Time to install and start the service:
    roundup-server -c install
    roundup-server -c start

13. Now open the URL in your web browser:
    http://roundupserver:8080/test/
    If all is well you will see the first (login) page of your tracker.
    Enter user "admin" (lowercase) and the password you set when you initialised the tracker.
    Now you have full access to the tracker.

Ready to go read all the other usage and customization documents and experiment with Roundup.
