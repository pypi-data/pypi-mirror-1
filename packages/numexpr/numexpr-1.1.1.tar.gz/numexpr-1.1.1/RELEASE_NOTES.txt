=================================
 Release notes for Numexpr 1.1.1
=================================

Changes from 1.1 to 1.1.1
=========================

- The case for multidimensional array operands is properly accelerated
  now.  Added a new benchmark (based on a script provided by Andrew
  Collette, thanks!) for easily testing this case in the future.
  Closes #12.

- Added a fix to avoid the caches in numexpr to grow too much.  The
  dictionary caches are kept now always with less than 256 entries.
  Closes #11.

- The VERSION file is correctly copied now (it was not present for the
  1.1 tar file, I don't know exactly why).  Closes #8.


Changes from 1.0 to 1.1
=======================

- Numexpr can work now in threaded environments.  Fixes #2.

- The test suite can be run programmatically by using
  ``numexpr.test()``.

- Support a more complete set of functions for expressions (including
  those that are not supported by MSVC 7.1 compiler, like the inverse
  hyperbolic or log1p and expm1 functions.  The complete list now is:

    * where(bool, number1, number2): number
        Number1 if the bool condition is true, number2 otherwise.
    * {sin,cos,tan}(float|complex): float|complex
        Trigonometric sinus, cosinus or tangent.
    * {arcsin,arccos,arctan}(float|complex): float|complex
        Trigonometric inverse sinus, cosinus or tangent.
    * arctan2(float1, float2): float
        Trigonometric inverse tangent of float1/float2.
    * {sinh,cosh,tanh}(float|complex): float|complex
        Hyperbolic sinus, cosinus or tangent.
    * {arcsinh,arccosh,arctanh}(float|complex): float|complex
        Hyperbolic inverse sinus, cosinus or tangent.
    * {log,log10,log1p}(float|complex): float|complex
        Natural, base-10 and log(1+x) logarithms.
    * {exp,expm1}(float|complex): float|complex
        Exponential and exponential minus one.
    * sqrt(float|complex): float|complex
        Square root.
    * {real,imag}(complex): float
        Real or imaginary part of complex.
    * complex(float, float): complex
        Complex from real and imaginary parts.
