========================
 Announcing Numexpr 1.3
========================

Numexpr is a fast numerical expression evaluator for NumPy.  With it,
expressions that operate on arrays (like "3*a+4*b") are accelerated
and use less memory than doing the same calculation in Python.

On this release, and due to popular demand, support for single
precision floating point types has been added.  This allows for both
improved performance and optimal usage of memory for the
single precision computations.  Of course, support for single
precision in combination with Intel's VML is there too :)

However, caveat emptor: the casting rules for floating point types
slightly differs from those of NumPy.  See the casting section at:

      http://code.google.com/p/numexpr/wiki/Overview

or the README.txt file for more info on this issue.

In case you want to know more in detail what has changed in this
version, have a look at ``RELEASE_NOTES.txt`` in the tarball.


Where I can find Numexpr?
=========================

The project is hosted at Google code in:
