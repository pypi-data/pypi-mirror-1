        Lineage is a Plone product that allows subfolders of a Plone site to appear as autonomous Plone sites to the everyday user. This hub and spoke structure allows site administrators to easily manage multiple, seemingly independent, sub-entity websites in one Plone. Furthermore, the "parent" site can access and view the content in all the "child" sites while the child sites only view their own content. The parent site can also syndicate chosen content to the selected child sites.
        
        
        Detailed Documentation
        ======================
        
        After you've bootstrapped your buildout, installed all the dependencies, and installed Lineage via Site Setup -> Add on Products, you are ready to go.
        
        Add a Child Site
        
        1. In Plone, go to your Home folder.
        2. Click Add New, and select Child Folder.
        3. Enter the title and description for the Child site.
        4. Click Save.
        5. The Plone site now has a Child site. A drop down will appear at the top of the Plone to the left of the site actions area. A user can select the Parent site or any Child sites from this drop down.
        
        
        Installation Instructions
        =========================
        
        If you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
        recipe to manage your project, you can add ``collective.lineage``
        to your instance part::
        
        [instance]
        ...
        eggs =
        Plone
        collective.lineage
        zcml =
        collective.lineage
        
        Currently this code depends on `PLIP 234`_ which should become a part
        of Plone 3.3.  If you want to use it now you can add the branches
        of the eggs for the plip::
        
        [buildout]
        parts =
        ...
        plip234-branches
        
        [plip234-branches]
        recipe = infrae.subversion
        location = plip234-branches
        as_eggs = true
        urls =
        http://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/Plone/branches/calvinhp-inavigationroot-fixes Plone
        http://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/plone.app.layout/branches/calvinhp-inavigationroot-fixes plone.app.layout
        http://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/plone.app.portlets/branches/calvinhp-inavigationroot-fixes plone.app.portlets
        
        Now you can re-run your buildout to get the all the dependencies::
        
        $ ./bin/buildout
        
        Once your buildout is finished you can start up your instance and install Lineage via the ``Add-on Products`` configlet in site setup.
