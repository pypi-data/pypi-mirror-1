The Beginnings of the Electric Sound Generation focuses on the period between 1900 and 1965 when innovative thinkers such as Thaddeus Cahill, Leon Theremin, Lloyd Loar, Adolph Rickenbacker, George Beauchamp, Laurens Hammond, Alvino Rey, Leo Fender, Les Paul, and Paul Bigsby, worked to harness electrical energy to produce sounds and tones in a variety of electric and electro-acoustic musical instruments. Inspired by the advances in science and technology of the late 19th century, these innovators could see that electric sound production opened up vast array of new sound possibilities which could easily combine with the traditions of counterpoint, harmony, and rhythm. Ultimately, through the work of these and many others, the world witnessed the birth of new sounds and tones. And musicians, in addition to gaining a new sound palette, also gained the tools to carefully control their volume, to define their own sound and tone, and to achieve their own musical voice. </p></p>","modified":"2009-10-04 05:03:51","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"ON: The Beginnings of the Electric Sound Generation","venue_address":"5790 Armada Drive","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","trackback_count":"0","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":"daily until March 31, 2010","calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":null,"created":"2009-03-28 02:27:19","venue_id":"V0-001-000104579-9","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Museum of Making Music","venue_url":"http://eventful.com/carlsbad_ca/venues/museum-of-making-music-/V0-001-000104579-9"},{"watching_count":"0","calendar_count":"0","comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"CA","postal_code":"92008","going_count":"0","all_day":"0","latitude":"33.127445","groups":null,"url":"http://eventful.com/carlsbad_ca/events/waves-inspiration-/E0-001-021721991-9@2010011210","id":"E0-001-021721991-9@2010011210","privacy":"1","city_name":"Carlsbad","link_count":"2","longitude":"-117.316678","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"California","start_time":"2010-01-12 10:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":" <b>Date(s):</b> 08/28/2009 - 03/31/2010 <br>Recurring weekly on Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday <br><b>Times:</b> 10:00 am to 5:00 pm <br><b>Location:</b> Museum of Making Music, 5790 Armada Drive, Carlsbad CA 92008 <br><b>Phone:</b> (760) 438-5996 <br><b>Admission:</b> $3 to $5 <br><a href=\"http://www.museumofmakingmusic.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Visit Web Site</a><p><p> The Museum of Making Music presents a major exhibition, \"Waves of Inspiration: The Legacy of Moog,\" exploring the life and vision of Dr. Robert Moog.

We will meet here at 5:30 p.m. to get a table. Think & Drink Trivia is a fun, frenzied, free event in which contestants can play solo or band together to form teams, and compete for bragging rights as well as to win fabulous prizes! The competition starts at 6pm sharp following a half hour of super cheap drink specials . The host Jesse-San buys a shot for all contestants to show up by 6pm, so getting to trivia early is smart (get it, smart). DJ Jose Sinatra (the legendary host of Winston's OB-oke Sundays and head cheese in his own band the Troy Dante Inferno) provides the original theme song, interlude music, and his unique brand of off-beat comedy. The Trivia Questions are weighted so that the later rounds become even more significant than the early, points go from one point per question in round one, all the way to ten points per question in the final round. Questions range from all sorts of general trivia factoids, geography, history, entertainment, famous people, movies, science, slogans, etc. The host asks a series of six questions per round, contestants write their answers on a slip of paper and submit it, then the host reads back the answers and awards points each round. Creative or humorous answers can garner an extra point if no team gets the actual correct answer, so writing something down is encouraged as opposed to leaving an answer blank. Every team that participates wins a prize at the end, the top teams get to pick their prize first, and there is one mystery prize per game that can be anything from a portable television to a can of spam. Think and Drink Trivia is the most fun you can have on a Tuesday in Ocean Beach, with happy hour drink specials, friendly competition, and a lot of laughs. Come on down to Winston's in O.B. at 1921 Bacon Street, or call for more info at 619-222-6822.\n","modified":"2009-12-28 11:26:10","venue_display":"0","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Winstons OB Trivia- Tuesday at 5:30 p.m on January 12, 2010","venue_address":null,"geocode_type":"Zip Code Based GeoCodes","trackback_count":"0","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://static.eventful.com/images/small/I0-001/002/374/175-2.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://static.eventful.com/images/medium/I0-001/002/374/175-2.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://static.eventful.com/images/small/I0-001/002/374/175-2.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://static.eventful.com/images/thumb/I0-001/002/374/175-2.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2009-12-28 11:26:10","venue_id":"V0-001-000134002-9","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Postal code 92115, US","venue_url":"http://eventful.com/sandiego/venues/postal-code-92115-us-/V0-001-000134002-9"},{"watching_count":"0","calendar_count":"0","comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"CA","postal_code":"92101","going_count":"0","all_day":"0","latitude":"32.7093668","groups":null,"url":"http://eventful.com/sandiego/events/live-jazz-piano-bar-/E0-001-022459506-6@2010011217","id":"E0-001-022459506-6@2010011217","privacy":"1","city_name":"San Diego","link_count":"3","longitude":"-117.1588797","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"California","start_time":"2010-01-12 17:30:00","tz_id":null,"description":"Join us in the Palm's exclusive piano bar for live entertainment 7 days a week.
