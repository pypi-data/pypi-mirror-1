Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        
        
        If both products plone.app.discussion and Products.PloneGazette are installed
        the creation of any PloneGazette contenttype fails, because PloneGazette
        contenttypes not provide the adapter for a particular interface.
        
        This product makes possible the creation of the PloneGazette contenttypes
        if there is an installation of plone.app.discussion in your instance.
