Description: 
        This package tries to find a repetitive pattern in an HTML page that contains
        some kind of a list (like digest pages). It extracts the sub-html text that
        creates the pattern, and try to extract useful information from it.
        The idea is that in a typical HTML data page that contains a list of items,
        there will be a repetitive pattern for the human eye (the page format). If this
        pattern will be the most prevalent in the page (this will be the case in most
        pages) we will be able to recognize it and "scrape" the relevant data.
