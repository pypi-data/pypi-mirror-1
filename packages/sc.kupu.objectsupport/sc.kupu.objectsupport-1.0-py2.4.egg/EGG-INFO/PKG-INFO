Description: sc.kupu.objectsupport
        =====================
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        A product that enables external Flash content inside Kupu..
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        - Kupu 1.4.x (http://plone.org/products/kupu)
        
        - Plone 3.1.x (http://plone.org/products/plone)
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To enable this product,on a buildout based installation:
        
        1. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``sc.kupu.objectsupport``
        to the list of eggs to install ::
        
        [buildout]
        ...
        eggs =
        sc.kupu.objectsupport
        
        2. Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::
        
        [instance]
        ...
        zcml =
        ...
        sc.kupu.objectsupport
        
        
        If another package depends on the sc.kupu.objectsupport egg or
        includes its zcml directly you do not need to specify anything in the
        buildout configuration: buildout will detect this automatically.
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run the ''bin/buildout'',
        which will take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in the Plone interface and click on the
        'Add/Remove Products' link.
        
        Choose the product (check its checkbox) and click the 'Install' button.
        
        Uninstall -- This can be done from the same management screen, but only
        if you installed it from the quick installer.
        
        Note: You may have to empty your browser cache and save your resource registries
        in order to see the effects of the product installation.
