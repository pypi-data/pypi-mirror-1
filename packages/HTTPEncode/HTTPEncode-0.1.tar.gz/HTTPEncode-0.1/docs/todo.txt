* Serializing a cgi.FieldStorage object that has files is hard.

* Encoding is really fuzzy.

* The unicode handling isn't finished.

* Supporting the XML set of objects is fuzzy, like
  ``application/xml+atom``.  ``application/xml`` can generally support
  that mime type.  It should probably first look for something
  supporting the full mime type, then fall back on application/xml.

* Should there be some way to get at the response headers?

* We should use better mimetype/Accept parsing (maybe this should go
  in ``paste.httpheaders``).

* We need a way to prefer mimetypes on our own on the server; probably
  this outweighs anything in the Accept headers.

* Servers can probably set ETags (at least optionally), maybe simply
  based on ``id(obj)``.

* Move to a FormEncode style of conversion and serialization, instead
  of the current setup (``load`` and ``dump_iter``).  Though it'd be
  nice to deal with streams as the current system does.  Content-Type
  will have to go in ``state`` somehow.

* Support fragments, as a post-processing phase.

* httplib2 seems to use email.Message.Message.items(), which folds
  Set-Cookie headers, which will not do!  Report bug.
