Introduction
============


This is a second level navigation that works as a companion to the built-in portal tabs.

It only shows the second level no matter how deep the you go down the navigation tree.

There is no css or layout so you need to do that by your self. There is not so much css that need to be implemented only:

id: subnav-<id of item>
class: "plain" or "selected" depending on if the item is selected or not. 

I think that is all you need to know...
Take care and enjoy.
