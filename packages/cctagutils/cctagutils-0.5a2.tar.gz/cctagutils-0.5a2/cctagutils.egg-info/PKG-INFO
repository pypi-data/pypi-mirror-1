        cctagutils is a package which provides a pluggable facility for retrieving
        and verifying license metadata embedded and linked to content files.
        Metadata may be embedded directly in the file, or provided in a web page
        linked to the file (in this case the URL is actually embedded in the file).
        
        cctagutils uses *handlers* for different file types, and ships with an ID3
        handler for MP3 files and an XMP handler for many other file types.  The
        XMP handler is used as a default fall-back for all files.  Information
        about embedding metadata is available in the CC wiki; see **Resources** below.
        
        Installation
        ************
        
        cctagutils and its dependencies may be installed using `easy_install
        <http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall>`_ (recommended) ::
        
        $ easy_install cctagutils
        
        or by using the standard distutils setup.py::
        
        $ python setup.py install
        
        If installing using setup.py, `ccrdf <http://python.org/pypi/ccrdf>`_
        will also need to be installed along with its dependencies.  Using
        easy_install will automatically download and install these dependencies.
        
        Usage
        *****
        
        cctagutils is primarily accessed through the `metadata` module.  For
        example:
        
        >>> import cctagutils
        >>> file_info = cctagutils.metadata.open('test/test.mp3')
        
        The `metadata` module will use entry points to look up the best fit handler
        for extracting metadata from the file.
        
        Extending cctagutils
        ********************
        
        cctagutils uses entry points for providing metadata handlers for new file
        types.  A metadata handler should subclass
        `cctagutils.handler.base.BaseMetadata`.  The package for the handler should
        declare that it implements the `cctagutils.handler` entry point.
        
        The cctagutils package declares itself as the entry points for MP3 and PDF
        files using the ID3 and XMP implementations respectively.
        
        Limitations and Known Issues
        ****************************
        
        * This is an alpha release of 0.5, and the API is still subject to change.
        * Handler lookup is currently based on file extensions, and should be
        improved to use something like the MIME type.

        * Reorganized source tree to work better with PyPI and setuptools
        * Converted to using entry points for file-type handling extensibility
