Changes
=======

1.1 (2009-09-18)
----------------

* A local utility implements now IAttributeAnnotatable.

* Update code documentation from Grok itself.

* Use 1.0b2 versions.cfg in Grok's release info instead of a local
  copy; a local copy for all grokcore packages is just too hard to
  maintain.


1.0.1 (2009-06-30)
------------------

* Reupload to pypi with a correct version of Python which doesn't have
  a distutils bug.

1.0 (2009-06-29)
----------------

* Created ``grokcore.site`` by factoring local site based components,
  grokkers and directives out of Grok.
