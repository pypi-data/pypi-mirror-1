Description: collective.plone.gsxml
        ======================
        
        An XML import/export add-on for Plone_.
        
        .. _Plone: http://www.plone.org
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        **collective.plone.gsxml** is a egg, so installation is easy
        if you use buildout.  You just need to add **collective.plone.gsxml**
        to your plone part's *eggs* AND *zcml* option.
        
        A example buildout is available here:
        
        https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/gsxml/buildout/trunk
        
        This package needs lxml_, see the buildout example.
        
        .. _lxml: http://www.codespeak.net/lxml
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        After installation, you'll get two new items in Plone's **action**
        menu, one for *import*, and one for *export*.  For additional stuff,
        please see the detailled documentation below.
        
        Features
        ========
        
        - Exports virtually all Archetypes-based documents
        - exports and keeps references
        - exports binary data as separate file
        - works with ZOPE blobs
        - sends custom events which you can subscribe to prior and after
        import/export
        - uses the ZCA to fetch a serializer for a content type -- the default
        adapter uses the Plone Marshaller
        
        Caveats
        =======
        
        This package relies pretty much on the **Marshall** product for plone
        (which is shipped with Plone).  This product, is, while offering great
        functionality, a bit convoluted and does not allow to hook in using
        the ZCA.
        
        Also, this package tries to export **references**, and this is
        currently done using pickles, which is not safe.  References should be
        exported by using adapters defined by those who actually use the
        references and know how to export them (it's impossible to do this in
        a generic way IMHO).
        
        Bugs
        ----
        
        - exports references using pickles
        - messes with the internals of the Marshal product due to lack of
        hooks
        - uses pickles, this is not secure
        - manifest XML is not yet parsed
        
        Annoyances
        ----------
        
        - convoluted code. The code of this package needs cleanup. This will
        be done in due course.
        
        Caveats
        -------
        
        - This package out-of-the-box export AT based content only, but you
        can provide your own serializer as adapter
        - This package does NOT export dynamically marked interfaces
        - This package does NOT export annotations on content
        
        Products.Poi
        ------------
        
        You need the branch version of Products.Marshall to handle the DataGridFields
        
        https://svn.plone.org/svn/archetypes/Products.Marshall/branches/use-zca-in-atns
        
        Products.eXtremeManagement
        --------------------------
        
        change line 44 of Products.eXtremeManagement.content.PoiTask to::
        
        def getAssignees(self):
        managers = set()
        try:
        for issue in self.getRefs('task_issues'):
        managers.add(issue.getResponsibleManager())
        except:
        pass
        return sorted(list(managers))
        
        because the references to the POI issues are fixed on the end of import and are
        *not* available when the object is recreated

        0.4.7 (2008-12-19)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed reference handling after import [ramonski]

        ------------------
        
        - Fixed tests and moved them into the source package. [seletz]

        Thanks to Freshmilk Entertainment GmbH for sponsoring this.
        [seletz]
        
        - Added a events notified for ``ObjectWillBeExportedEvent``, ``ObjectExportedEvent``,
        ``ObjectWillBeImportedEvent`` and ``ObjectImportedEvent``.
        [seletz]
        
        - Added ``lxml`` and ``libxml2-python`` to the buildout.  Added ZOPE-enabled
        ipython to the buildout. [seletz]

        Detailed Documentation
        ======================
        
        Exporting content
        -----------------
        
        To test exporting some content, we'll create content::
        
        >>> _ = self.folder.invokeFactory("Folder", "content")
        >>> folder = self.folder["content"]
        >>> _ = folder.invokeFactory("Document", "doc1", title="A Document")
        >>> _ = folder.invokeFactory("Document", "doc2", title="A second Document")
        >>> folder.keys()
        ['doc1', 'doc2']
        
        Now we create a ``export context`` -- this will act like a container
        holding the exported data.  We'll use the ``TarballExportContext``
        here::
        
        >>> from collective.plone.gsxml.context import TarballExportContext
        >>> export_context = TarballExportContext()
        
        Now we create a exporter object, which will use the export context
        created above to store the export data, and use the Marshaller to
        actually marshall content.  We initialize the exporter with the
        ``root`` folder which we want to export::
        
        >>> from collective.plone.gsxml.content import XMLContentFSExporter
        >>> exporter = XMLContentFSExporter(folder)
        
        Now we're able to start the export.  We supply the **export context**
        and a folder *inside the export context* (thus, one export context can
        be used multiple times by supplying different root folders).  We also
        specify that this is a root-level export::
        
        >>> exporter.export(export_context, "structure", True)
        
        Ok, that's it.  The archive stream may now be fetched from the export
        context::
        
        >>> archive = export_context.getArchiveStream()
        >>> archive.seek(0)
        
        Importing content
        -----------------
        
        To test importing, we'll delete the objects exported above::
        
        >>> folder.manage_delObjects(['doc1', 'doc2'])
        >>> folder.keys()
        []
        
        Now we create a ``import context``, which will hold our exported
        stream, and a importer, which will use that import context to read
        marshalled data from::
        
        >>> from collective.plone.gsxml.context import TarballImportContext
        >>> import_context = TarballImportContext(archive)
        
        The importer -- we initialize the importer with the *target* folder::
        
        >>> from collective.plone.gsxml.content import XMLContentFSImporter
        >>> importer = XMLContentFSImporter(folder)
        
        Now we start the import. We supply the **import context** and the root
        folder *within* the import context.  Also, we indicate that this is
        indeed a root-level import::
        
        >>> importer.import_(import_context, "structure", True)
        
        We're now able to get the documents again::
        
        >>> folder.keys()
        ['doc1', 'doc2']
        >>> folder.doc1.Title()
        'A Document'
