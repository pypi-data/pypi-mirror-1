-------------------------------------------------

* BUGFIX: id set in config.py, UIDs are now no longer exported. This
  allows for importing the sam eimport twice, whcih would have resulted in
  UID clashes otherwise.

* @@gsxml view: added view to allow for external access of import/export
  functionality using XMLRPC

* renamed package from "inquant.plone.gsxml' to 'collective.plone.gsxml'

* reformatted documentation to match PyPi standards better
