Description: collective.plone.gsxml
        ======================
        
        An XML import/export add-on for Plone_.
        
        .. _Plone: http://www.plone.org
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        **collective.plone.gsxml** is a egg, so installation is easy
        if you use buildout.  You just need to add **collective.plone.gsxml**
        to your plone part's *eggs* AND *zcml* option.
        
        A example buildout is available here:
        
        https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/gsxml/buildout/trunk
        
        This package needs lxml_, see the buildout example.
        
        .. _lxml: http://www.codespeak.net/lxml
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        After installation, you'll get two new
        items in Plone's **action** menu, one for *import*, and
        one for *export*.
        
        Bugs, Annoyances, Caveats
        =========================
        
        This package relies pretty much on the **Marshal_** product
        for plone (which is shipped with Plone).  This product, is, while offering
        great functionality, a bit convoluted and does not allow to hook in
        using the ZCA.
        
        Also, this package tries to export **references**, and this is currently done
        using pickles, which is not safe.  References should be exported by using adapters
        defined by those who actually use the references and know how to export them (it's
        impossible to do this in a generic way IMHO).
        
        Bugs
        ----
        
        - exports references using pickles
        - messes with the internals of the Marshal product due to lack of
        hooks
        - uses pickles, this is not secure
        - manifest XML is not yet parsed
        
        Annoyances
        ----------
        
        - convoluted code. The code of this package needs cleanup. This will be done in due
        course.
        
        Caveats
        -------
        
        - This package can export AT based content only.
        - This package does NOT export dynamically marked interfaces
        - This package does NOT export annotations on content

        * worked on the ImportExport view. Added more metadata
        to the report of list_exportable_items method.

        -------------------------------------------------
        
        * register '@@gsxml' view for *
        
        * add security for '@@gsxml' view
        
        * add 'list_exportable_items' method to '@@gsxml'
        
        * removed junk code
        
        2008-07-19  seletz <stefan.eletzhofer@inquant.de>
        -------------------------------------------------
        
        * BUGFIX: id set in config.py, UIDs are now no longer exported. This
        allows for importing the sam eimport twice, whcih would have resulted in
        UID clashes otherwise.
        
        * @@gsxml view: added view to allow for external access of import/export
        functionality using XMLRPC
        
        * renamed package from "inquant.plone.gsxml' to 'collective.plone.gsxml'
        
        * reformatted documentation to match PyPi standards better
