    * fix test for collector.
    * addef and fixed fsexporter test.

2008-12-11  Stefan Eletzhofer <stefan.eletzhofer@inquant.de>

    * content.py: Added more events.
    * content.py: Check for PloneArticle and ignore PA ``InnerContent*``
    fields.

2008-10-14  Stefan Eletzhofer <stefan.eletzhofer@inquant.de>

    * content.py (XMLContentFSImporter.importFiles): fix bug wrt. handling
    of blob fields.  These are now treated like the file fields.

2008-07-23  seletz <stefan.eletzhofer@inquant.de>

    * fold in changes from upper directory, misset his file :p
    * browsser/importexport.py: created and separated from gsxml.py
      The latter is probably to be refactored later.  Most of the registered
      views are no longer used.  **sigh**, bit rot.
    * ImportExportView: the **list_exportable_items** now reports more usable
      meta data, and does it structured.  This is to help sync policies to
      decide what the should actually sync or not. (syncing will be fold in
      from a customer package later).

2008-07-20  seletz <stefan.eletzhofer@inquant.de>

    * register '@@gsxml' view for *
    * add security for '@@gsxml' view
    * add 'list_exportable_items' method to '@@gsxml'
    * removed junk code

2008-07-19  seletz <stefan.eletzhofer@inquant.de>

    * BUGFIX: id set in config.py, UIDs are now no longer exported. This
      allows for importing the sam eimport twice, whcih would have resulted in
      UID clashes otherwise.
    * @@gsxml view: added view to allow for external access of import/export
        functionality using XMLRPC
    * renamed package from "inquant.plone.gsxml' to 'collective.plone.gsxml'
    * reformatted documentation to match PyPi standards better

2008-07-09  seletz <stefan.eletzhofer@inquant.de>

    * renamed the package to collective.plone.gsxml
    * added minimal plone buildout for easy testing. Still need
      to make the tests more sand end remove bit-rot

2008-04-16  hannosch <hanno@jarn.com>

    * content.py: Added unmarkCreationFlag method call for all AT-based
      content. Sp far all imported objects would think they should be
      initialized after the first edit. This broke event handlers registered
      for ObjectInitializedEvent.

2008-03-06  ramonski <ramon.bartl@inquant.de>

    * collector.py (SimpleDictCollector.getReferencesXml): added method to get
    the mime type of a file.
    * content.py (check_for_filefield): created to use for check to decide
    whether or not to write data files instead of inline XML CDATA
    * content.py (XMLContentFSExporter.exportFiles): refactored
    * content.py (XMLContentFSImporter.importFiles): refactored, now sets the
    correct mime type. Yay.
