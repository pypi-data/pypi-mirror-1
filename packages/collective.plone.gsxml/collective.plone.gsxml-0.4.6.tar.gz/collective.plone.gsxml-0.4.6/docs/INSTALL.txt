Installation
============

**collective.plone.gsxml** is a egg, so installation is easy
if you use buildout.  You just need to add **collective.plone.gsxml**
to your plone part's *eggs* AND *zcml* option.

A example buildout is available here:

https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/gsxml/buildout/trunk
