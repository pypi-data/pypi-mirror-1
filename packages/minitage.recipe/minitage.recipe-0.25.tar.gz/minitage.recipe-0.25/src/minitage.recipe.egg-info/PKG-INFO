        =======================
        README
        =======================
        
        
        The recipe has those entry point:
        - cmmi: install configure/make/make install softwares
        - fetch: fetch something somewhere
        - eggs: install python eggs / packages 'setuptoolisables'
        - printer: print or dump to a file all versions needed to achieve eggs
        requirements (versions.cfg made easy)
        - scripts: install scripts from an egg and install egg dependencies if they
        are not already in the cache
        
        The reasons why i have rewrite yet another buildout recipe builder are:
        - Support for downloading stuff
        - Support on the fly patchs
        - Support hookss
        - Support for distutils
        - Robust offline mode
        - We like pypi, but offer a mode to not use it if we do not want to.
