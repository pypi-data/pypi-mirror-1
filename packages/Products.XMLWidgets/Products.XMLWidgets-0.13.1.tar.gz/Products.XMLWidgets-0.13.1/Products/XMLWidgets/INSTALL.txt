Installing XMLWidgets

  To install XMLWidgets, simply unpack the '.tgz' in your Zope's Products
  directory (usually 'lib/python/Products' under your Zope install).

Dependencies

  Using XMLWidgets makes no sense without ParsedXML (1.3.1), which you
  can find here:
 
    "ParsedXML-1.3.1.tgz":http://www.zope.org/Members/faassen/ParsedXML/ParsedXML-1.3.1.tgz

Previous versions of XMLWidgets (before 0.8)

  Previous versions of XMLWidgets (before 0.8) are completely and
  utterly incompatible with this version of XMLWidgets. It is a
  complete rewrite, and depends on another XML system altogether
  (Parsed XML instead of XML Document). The only things similar are
  the name and the concept.
