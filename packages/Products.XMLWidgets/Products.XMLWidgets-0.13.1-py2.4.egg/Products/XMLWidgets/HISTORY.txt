=======

0.13.1 (2008/09/30)
-------------------

- Reformat documentation to ReST for an egg release.

0.13
----

Bugs Fixed:

- Now that Silva uses Five for i18n, we can get rid of various
  compatibility hacks to work around PlacelessTranslationService's
  broken unicode support. We essentially go back to 0.10.3's version
  of ``EditorSupport.py``.

0.12
----
 
Bugs Fixed:

- Also provide facility to use the TALInterpreter's ``StringIO()``
  for joins within widget code. This makes Silva more compatible
  with PlacelessTranslationService's rather horrible approach to
  unicode handling.

0.11
----

Bugs Fixed:

- Make use of ``TAL.TALInterpreter.TALInterpreter.StringIO()`` for
  safe string concatenation. This will make Silva compatible with
  PlacelessTranslationService.

0.10.3
------

Bugs Fixed:

- ``_getDocumentKey`` was not used on all places where it should have.

0.10.2
------

Bugs Fixed:

- Made the info tab load properly by adding a security declaration.

0.10.1
------

Features Added

- Added homepage.html.

0.10
----

Features Added:
                                                                 
- More rewrites of the caching system. The cache can now be attached
  to an arbitrary Zope folder, which mainly facilitates the sharing of
  the cache in a ZEO Cluster setup.

- The maximum cache size now is configureable by using the edit tab of
  the EditorService object (in Silva this object has ``service_editor``
  for its id).

Bugs Fixed:
                                                          
- The cache ``compact()`` method would not work correctly.

0.9
---

Features Added:

- Rewritten caching system. Now cache is stored globally and not on
  Silva editor anymore.

0.8.5
-----

Features Added:

- render and renderElements now have behavior of renderCached and
  renderElementsCached -- these previous versions still exist for
  backwards compatibility but will be removed at some point so please
  switch over to using render and renderElements in your code.

0.8.4 
-----

Bugs Fixed:

- Fixed memory leak; instead of setting node as direct attribute of
  request, node is set with dictionary notation. This seems to
  eliminate a memory leak.

0.8.3
-----

Bugs Fixed:

- Instead of checking for an attribute ``cached`` it is now calling a
  method called ``cached()`` on the widget.
     
0.8.2
-----

Bugs Fixed:

- Workaround for strange security bug of page templates on Zope2.5.1
  (by Clemens Klein-Robbenhaar)

0.8.1
-----

Features Added:

- Cleanup of ZMI tabs.

0.8
---

Initial Release:

- Initial public release of the completely rewritten XMLWidgets for
  ParsedXML.
