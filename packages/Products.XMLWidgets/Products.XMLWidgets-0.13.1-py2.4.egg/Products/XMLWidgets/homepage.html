XMLWidgets is a Zope Product/Framework to create dynamic translations
of ParsedXML documents to HTML pages. Each XML node is represented by a
*widget*. A widget can display itself (to HTML), and handle user
events (clicks, form submits) in the same HTML page.

XMLWidgets is used in <a

forms-based XML editor as well as the Silva XML to HTML renderer.
