Description: 
        XMLWidgets
        ==========
        
        XMLWidgets can be used to create through the web viewers and editors
        of XML content, stored in ParsedXML.
        
        Note: I don't expect people to understand XMLWidgets without far more
        information. For now, perhaps an example would help. Silva's editor is
        such an example, so you could install Silva and play with it (see
        especially the ``service_widgets`` directory, and note the scripts in
        ``service_setup`` to register any new widgets).
        
        The *XMLWidgets Editor Service* is added just once to a Zope system
        and should be called ``service_editor``. It is a singleton which
        provides a number of facilities for viewers and editors.
        
        The *XMLWidgets Registry* is used to register widgets (usually simple
        Zope folders with content such as page templates and python
        scripts). Currently they don't become equipped with any user
        interface, so you must use Python Scripts to configure them. The
        *XMLWidgets Editor Service* then can use this information to render
        documents (possibly in editor mode).

        Changes
        =======
        
        0.13.1 (2008/09/30)
        -------------------
        
        - Reformat documentation to ReST for an egg release.
        
        0.13
        ----
        
        Bugs Fixed:
        
        - Now that Silva uses Five for i18n, we can get rid of various
        compatibility hacks to work around PlacelessTranslationService's
        broken unicode support. We essentially go back to 0.10.3's version
        of ``EditorSupport.py``.
        
        0.12
        ----
        
        Bugs Fixed:
        
        - Also provide facility to use the TALInterpreter's ``StringIO()``
        for joins within widget code. This makes Silva more compatible
        with PlacelessTranslationService's rather horrible approach to
        unicode handling.
        
        0.11
        ----
        
        Bugs Fixed:
        
        - Make use of ``TAL.TALInterpreter.TALInterpreter.StringIO()`` for
        safe string concatenation. This will make Silva compatible with
        PlacelessTranslationService.
        
        0.10.3
        ------
        
        Bugs Fixed:
        
        - ``_getDocumentKey`` was not used on all places where it should have.
        
        0.10.2
        ------
        
        Bugs Fixed:
        
        - Made the info tab load properly by adding a security declaration.
        
        0.10.1
        ------
        
        Features Added
        
        - Added homepage.html.
        
        0.10
        ----
        
        Features Added:
        
        - More rewrites of the caching system. The cache can now be attached
        to an arbitrary Zope folder, which mainly facilitates the sharing of
        the cache in a ZEO Cluster setup.
        
        - The maximum cache size now is configureable by using the edit tab of
        the EditorService object (in Silva this object has ``service_editor``
        for its id).
        
        Bugs Fixed:
        
        - The cache ``compact()`` method would not work correctly.
        
        0.9
        ---
        
        Features Added:
        
        - Rewritten caching system. Now cache is stored globally and not on
        Silva editor anymore.
        
        0.8.5
        -----
        
        Features Added:
        
        - render and renderElements now have behavior of renderCached and
        renderElementsCached -- these previous versions still exist for
        backwards compatibility but will be removed at some point so please
        switch over to using render and renderElements in your code.
        
        0.8.4
        -----
        
        Bugs Fixed:
        
        - Fixed memory leak; instead of setting node as direct attribute of
        request, node is set with dictionary notation. This seems to
        eliminate a memory leak.
        
        0.8.3
        -----
        
        Bugs Fixed:
        
        - Instead of checking for an attribute ``cached`` it is now calling a
        method called ``cached()`` on the widget.
        
        0.8.2
        -----
        
        Bugs Fixed:
        
        - Workaround for strange security bug of page templates on Zope2.5.1
        (by Clemens Klein-Robbenhaar)
        
        0.8.1
        -----
        
        Features Added:
        
        - Cleanup of ZMI tabs.
        
        0.8
        ---
        
        Initial Release:
        
        - Initial public release of the completely rewritten XMLWidgets for
        ParsedXML.
