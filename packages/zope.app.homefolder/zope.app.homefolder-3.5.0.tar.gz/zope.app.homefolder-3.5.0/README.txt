The principal home folder subscriber lets you assign home folders to
principals as you would do in any OS. This particular implementation of such a
feature is intended as a demo of the power of the way to handle principals
and not as the holy grail. If you have concerns about the assumptions made in
this implementation (which are probably legitimate), just ignore this package
altogether.
