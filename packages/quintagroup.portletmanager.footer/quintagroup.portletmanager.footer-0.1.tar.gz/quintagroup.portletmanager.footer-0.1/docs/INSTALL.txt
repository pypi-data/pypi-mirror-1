Installation
============

To install quintagroup.portletmanager.footer into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:

* Copy ``quintagroup`` folder to the ``/path/to/instance/lib/python`` directory.

* Create a file called ``quintagroup.portletmanager.footer-configure.zcml`` in the ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory. The file should only contain this::

   <include package="quintagroup.portletmanager.footer" />

* Restart the Zope server, for example, with the following command in the terminal::

   $ ./bin/zopectl restart
   
* Install this products with QuickInstaller in Plone
   
Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:   
   
* Add ``quintagroup.portletmanager.footer`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        quintagroup.portletmanager.footer

* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        quintagroup.portletmanager.footer

* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::

    $ ./bin/buildout
    
* Restart the Zope server, for example, with the following command in the terminal::

    $ ./bin/instance restart    

* Install this products with QuickInstaller in Plone
