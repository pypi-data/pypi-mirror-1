Too much hacking with the previous approach.

As it turns out, I now have teTeX installed. So it looks like I'll
be using vim/Emacs + LaTeX for documentation.

DocBook wasn't to my taste, and I stopped soon after.

I didn't start again, until recently. ;-)

I now write in ReStructuredText. I use Zope as the content management
system, which has the advantage of automatic HTML rendering. Not
having to run the Jade command line shown below (or the
ReStructuredText equivalent) to generate HTML is like getting rid of
the "compile/link" step in the "edit-compile/link-run"
cycle. Productivity goes up!

Of course, nobody in his right mind does serious editing using Zope's
TTW interface. I use Emacs/ange-ftp.

I envisage some kind of ReportLab-based magic to generate PDF output
easily from within Zope.

Here begins documentation.

A year ago, I started writing documentation in Structured Text, but didn't 
get very far.

I'm currently writing in DocBook. I use the following to process the 
DocBook files:

- DocBook 4.1
- Modular DSSSL stylesheets 1.64
- Jade 1.2.1
- SP 1.3.4
- ISO 8879-1986 character entity sets. (I don't really know how these are used.)

I invoke Jade thusly::

    jade -V nochunks -t sgml -d /.../html/docbook.dsl file.docbook > file.html
