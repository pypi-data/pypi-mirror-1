A WSGI front-door dispatcher.

WFront is a simple top-level request dispatcher, directing requests
based on "Virtual Host".  WFront can be used to host multiple
WSGI-powered domains in a single process, emulate a mod_proxy,
SCGI/FastCGI/AJP or mod_python WSGI setup for development, or any
other composition where operating at the host-level is desired.
Mapping HTTP/1.0 requests to HTTP/1.1 Host:-style requests is
supported and is very flexible.

Full documentation is in the module.  Enjoy!
