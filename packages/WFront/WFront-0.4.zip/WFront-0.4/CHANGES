WFront Changelog
================

0.4
---
(Released December 28th, 2008)

- Removed ``by_port`` synonym for wfront.route.

- WFront places its match criteria in ``wsgiorg.routing_args`` as a
  ``wfront_match`` named parameter.

- ``environ`` rewriting is now available as a standalone WSGI
  middleware, via ``wfront.EnvironWriter()``.

- The ``sprintf`` rewrite always fires.  Previously it would only fire
  if the target key was already present in the environ.

- Added ``setdefault`` rewrite rule.

- Added ``echo_app``, a simple WSGI app for testing and debugging
  server and rewriter configurations.

- Environ rewriter rules can be specified as a sequence of pairs in
  addition to dict.  The ordering of rules is preserved within
  rewriting categories.

- Cleanup routines have been reworked as filters, wrapping the WSGI
  app.  The filter is responsible for producing the WSGI response.  Do
  not forget to call the application!  This is backwards incompatible.

- Added PathMap, sugar for setting up a simple path-only router

- Path matches now consume PATH_INFO.  This is backwards incompatible.

- Most internal functions have relocated to wfront._internal.

- Added ``examples/`` directory.

- Added pound examples.

- Added stunnel examples.

- Documentation now via sphinx.

- 'multiserver' is now an undocumented, unsupported easter egg.
