        WFront
        ======
        
        A WSGI front-door dispatcher, virtual host router and environ
        manipulation swiss-army knife.
        
        WFront is a top-level request dispatcher, directing requests based on
        the requested "Virtual Host", listening port, URL path, or any
        combination.
        
        WFront can be used to:
        
        * host multiple WSGI-powered domains in a single process
        * emulate a mod_proxy, SCGI/FastCGI/AJP, mod_wsgi, or mod_python WSGI
        setup under a simple development mode WSGI server,
        * simplify development and testing of complex, multi-server cluster
        environments
        * or just perform simple path-based request dispatching
        
        Mapping HTTP/1.0 requests to HTTP/1.1 Host:-style requests is supported
        and is very flexible.  WFront includes an environ manipulation toolkit
        that allows for additions to and transformations of server-provided
        environ data to be performed on each request.
        
        The `development version
        <http://www.bitbucket.org/jek/wfront/get/tip.tgz#WFront==dev>`_ of
        WFront can be installed via ``easy_install WFront==dev`` or from the
        `mercurial repository <http://www.bitbucket.org/jek/wfront>`_.
