WFront
******

WFront is a top-level request dispatcher, directing requests based on
the requested "Virtual Host", listening port, URL path, or any
combination.

WFront can be used to:

* host multiple WSGI-powered domains in a single process

* emulate a mod_proxy, SCGI/FastCGI/AJP, mod_wsgi, or mod_python WSGI
  setup under a simple development mode WSGI server

* simplify development and testing of complex, multi-server cluster
  environments

* or just perform simple path-based request dispatching

Mapping HTTP/1.0 requests to HTTP/1.1 Host:-style requests is
supported and is very flexible.  WFront includes an environ
manipulation toolkit that allows for additions to and transformations
of server-provided environ data to be performed on each request.
