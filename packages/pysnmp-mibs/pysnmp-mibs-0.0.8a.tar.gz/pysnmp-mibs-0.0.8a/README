Pre-compiled MIB modules for PySNMP
-----------------------------------

This is a set of pre-compiled MIB files for the PySNMP framework.

All these files were autogenerated from MIB text files using
ether build-pysnmp-mib or rebuild-pysnmp-mibs tools. The
former is distributed with pysnmp package while the latter
with this pysnmp-mibs one.
