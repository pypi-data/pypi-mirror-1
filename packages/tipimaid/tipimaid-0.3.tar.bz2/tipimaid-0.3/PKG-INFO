Description: 
        Tipimaid is a collection of tools to ease the handling of Apache logs. It can
        be used as a piped logger for Apache and allows you to distribute log entries
        to different logfiles according to their virtual host information and the date
        and time of the request. Logging can be done either locally or over the network
        so that you can concentrate logs of a server farm on one logging computer.
        
        The Tipimaid collection comprises four scripts which are:
        
        tipimaid.py
        Used either as a piped logging tool or receives its loglines from
        ``tipimaid_server.py``. It rotates logfiles and distributes loglines
        to different logfiles and is able to execute stuff when a file is rotated.
        
        tipimaid_sender.py
        Used as a piped logging tool to send loglines across the network to
        ``tipimaid_server.py``
        
        tipimaid_server.py
        receives loglines sent by ``tipimaid_sender.py`` or netcat_ and outputs
        them to stdout where they are usually piped to ``tipimaid.py``
        
        tipimaid_mergelogs.py
        The disaster recovery tool if something went terribly wrong during
        logging over the network. It does a mergesort of several logfiles and
        outputs chronologically sorted loglines to stdout.
