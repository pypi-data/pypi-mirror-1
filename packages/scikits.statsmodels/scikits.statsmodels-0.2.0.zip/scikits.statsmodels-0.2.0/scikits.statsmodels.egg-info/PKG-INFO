Description: 
        Statsmodels is a python package that provides a complement to scipy for
        statistical computations including descriptive statistics and
        estimation of statistical models.
        
        scikits.statsmodels provides classes and functions for the estimation of
        several categories of statistical models. These currently include linear
        regression models, OLS, GLS, WLS and GLS with AR(p) errors, generalized
        linear models for six distribution families, M-estimators for robust
        linear models, and regression with discrete dependent variables, Logit,
        Probit, MNLogit, Poisson, based on maximum likelihood estimators.
        An extensive list of result statistics are avalable for each estimation
        problem.

        Main Changes in 0.2.0
        ---------------------
        
        * Improved documentation and expanded and more examples
        * Added four discrete choice models: Poisson, Probit, Logit, and Multinomial Logit.
        * Added PyDTA. Tools for reading Stata binary datasets (*.dta) and putting
        them into numpy arrays.
        * Added four new datasets for examples and tests.
        * Results classes have been refactored to use lazy evaluation.
        * Improved support for maximum likelihood estimation.
        * bugfixes
        * renames for more consistency
        RLM.fitted_values -> RLM.fittedvalues
        GLMResults.resid_dev -> GLMResults.resid_deviance
        
        Sandbox
        -------
        
        We are continuing to work on support for systems of equations models, panel data
        models, time series analysis, and information and entropy econometrics in the
        sandbox. This code is often merged into trunk as it becomes more robust.
