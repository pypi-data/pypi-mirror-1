* The zope.schema.DateTime field only accepts datetime.datetime
  objects as valid values but p4a.image.thirdparty._imagedata uses
  DateTime.DateTime.  Standardize on datetime.datetime.
* Add test coverage to make sure that extracted metadata passes the
  schema validation.  Currently there are type errors on strings that
  are extracted as ascii but should be unicode.
