Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        *utsessions* allow the features of timed and unique sessions for an user
        account in Django.
        
        What does it do ?
        =================
        
        *utsessions* is a middleware that makes all opened user sessions unique.
        
        When an user session is opened, the user account can't be reused
        before a certain amount of time. After this time, if the user account
        is reused, the first session is closed and a second one is opened.
        
        A session can also be automaticaly closed after a choosen time.
        
        This kind of behavior is useful for websites providing access to data
        by unique user account.
        
        Philosophy
        ==========
        
        *utsessions* was written to be easily :
        
        * Installed in your projects, by simply registering the middleware.
        * Extended thanks to his design in object: each component can be removed or reused.
        * Configured, with the settings.py file which allows different behaviors.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Download the latest packaged version at http://code.google.com/p/django-ut-sessions/
        and unpack it.
        
        You can also perform a Subversion checkout to get the latest code. ::
        
        svn checkout http://django-ut-sessions.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ django-ut-sessions
        
        Inside the package use this command line to install the package into
        your PYTHONPATH. ::
        
        $> python setup.py install
        
        Project installation
        ====================
        
        Now simply add this following line into your *MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES* section. ::
        
        utsessions.middleware.UTSessionMiddleware
        
        It must be after the SessionMiddleware and AuthentifcationMiddleware
        like this : ::
        
        MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
        'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
        'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
        'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',
        'utsessions.middleware.UTSessionMiddleware',
        )
        
        Settings
        ========
        
        If you want to define the period of a session before being logged out,
        set a value in seconds to *SESSION_LIMIT_SECONDS* in your settings.py
        
        A session can be released for another user before a certain amount of
        time, set to default at 300 seconds. To change this value define
        *SESSION_TOKEN_LIMIT_SECONDS*. If set to 0, no lock will be created.
        
        Tests
        =====
        
        Put utsessions into your *INSTALLED_APPS* section and run : ::
        
        $> python manage.py test utsessions
