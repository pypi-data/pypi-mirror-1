0.2.1
 - Delete spurious references to deleted ``unipath.platform`` package.

0.2.0
 - Rename Path to AbstractPath, and FSPath to Path.  FSPath remains as an
   alias for backward compatibility.
 - Allow integers in constructor.
 - Path.mkdir() checks whether the directory exists first.
 - Test suite now uses nose instead of unittest.
 - "+" operator returns concatenated path rather than string.
 - Bugfix in Path.rel_path_to().
 - Thanks to Roman <mereandor@gmail.com> for patches and suggestions.
 - Delete Path.symlink(); use Path.write_link() instead -- note that the 
   arg is the desination rather than the source!
 - Path.make_relative_link_to() is a shortcut for
   ``self.write_link(self.rel_path_to(dst))``.
 - Delete the ``platform`` package.  See the tests if you need non-native
   path syntax.`
