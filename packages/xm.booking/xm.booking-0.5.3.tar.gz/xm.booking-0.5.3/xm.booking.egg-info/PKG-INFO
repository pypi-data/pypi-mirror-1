Description: xm.booking
        ==========
        
        This is a package for booking hours on a content type.  It also
        handles estimates of duration or size.  It is a spin-off from
        eXtremeManagement.  Quite likely some more code needs to move between
        those two.
        
        xm.booking is intended to be useful without eXtremeManagement.  But
        for now the bookings from Products.eXtremeManagement.content.Bookings
        are used.  In place of that we want to make a nice and small Zope 3
        content object.  Of course this needs migration code in
        eXtremeManagement.
        
        Conversely, eXtremeManagement depends on xm.booking, so if you change
        this package, please also run the eXtremeManagement tests.  If unsure,
        please contact the eXtremeManagement authors or mailing list.  See

        =====================
        
        0.5.3 (2008-08-06)
        ------------------
        
        - Use allow_access_to_unprotected_subobjects to give access to the
        'allowed' attribute of the add booking form viewlet in case this
        viewlet gets rendered within a KSS view (while adding a booking
        using that same form), which messes up the Acquisition chain or
        something, resulting in not showing the quick add-booking form
        afterwards, until a refresh of the page, which is want we wanted to
        avoid in the first place...  [maurits]
