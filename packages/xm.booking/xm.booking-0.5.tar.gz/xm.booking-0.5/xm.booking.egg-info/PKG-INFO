Description: xm.booking
        ==========
        
        This is a package for booking hours on a content type.  It also
        handles estimates of duration or size.  It is a spin-off from
        eXtremeManagement.  Quite likely some more code needs to move between
        those two.
        
        xm.booking is intended to be useful without eXtremeManagement.  But
        for now the bookings from Products.eXtremeManagement.content.Bookings
        are used.  In place of that we want to make a nice and small Zope 3
        content object.  Of course this needs migration code in
        eXtremeManagement.
        
        Conversely, eXtremeManagement depends on xm.booking, so if you change
        this package, please also run the eXtremeManagement tests.  If unsure,
        please contact the eXtremeManagement authors or mailing list.  See
