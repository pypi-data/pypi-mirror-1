Description: ==================
        Products.CalendarX
        ==================
        
        This product restructured from http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/CalendarX
        to follow the buildout structure.
        
        The new repository for Products.CalendarX is
        http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/Products.CalendarX
        
        This version is identical to 0.9.2 but packaged as an egg to leverage
        zc.buildout and setuptools.
        
        Mode documentation is available in Products/CalendarX/README.txt and
        Products/CalendarX/docs/*
        
        A more Plone 3ish version is actually at work in
        http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/Products.CalendarX/branches/plone3refactoring
        and will include :
        
        * ZCA views in place of CMF skin layers
        * More unit tests
        * Using jQuery where possible to keep JS small.
        
        Contributors are welcome.
