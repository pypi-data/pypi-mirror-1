==================
Products.CalendarX
==================

This product restructured from http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/CalendarX
to follow the buildout structure.

The new repository for Products.CalendarX is
http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/Products.CalendarX

This version is identical to 0.9.2 but packaged as an egg to leverage
zc.buildout and setuptools.

Mode documentation is available in Products/CalendarX/README.txt and
Products/CalendarX/docs/*

A more Plone 3ish version is actually at work in
http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/Products.CalendarX/branches/plone3refactoring
and will include :

* ZCA views in place of CMF skin layers
* More unit tests
* Using jQuery where possible to keep JS small.

Contributors are welcome.
