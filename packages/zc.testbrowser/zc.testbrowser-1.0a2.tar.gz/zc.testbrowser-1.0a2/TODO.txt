clean up sockets after tests
add "click button on next message box" command
fix for/work around Firefox's "Do you want to remember the password" dialog
move the "fixed bugs" section to its own document
think about defining an API for zc.testbrowser to expose so zope.testbrowser
    can use; about making implementation specific package names; about making
    zc.testbrowser a namespace package
rework tests to be more documenty
mention the pattern of instantiating the browser object outside the doctest
file upload controls don't actually do anything
I /think/ looking up controls via labels isn't quite right; need a test case
