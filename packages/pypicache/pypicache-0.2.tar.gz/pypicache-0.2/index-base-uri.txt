If the index is to be hosted under /some/path/ then, with v 0.1, its necessary
to make some non-obvious manual tweaks to the re-write rules. Also the
``--download-path`` and ``--projects-path`` options are ill conceived.

From the package-index-api_

    2. Individual project version pages' URLs must be of the form base/projectname/version, where base is the package index's base URL.


So lets:
    * Make ``-U``, ``--index-url`` specify the exact url that should be used
      to access the index, including the `base/` part of the project path.
    * Remove the ``--projects-path`` option and instead use the
      path part of index-url when generating base/project and
      base/project/version hrefs.
    * Require a trailing slash on the ``index-url`` option, log
      an error and exit if its missing.
    * Keep the ``--downloads-path`` option, and use it when 
      generating the index local download links.
    * use posixpath.join semantics to *join* the download path
      to the project path component of the index url. So a ``--download-url``
      that specifies an absolute path (``startswith('/')``) will produce
      download urls that are relative to the site root rather than the index
      root.
    * Don't support generation of links to other hosts. ie, ``--download-path``
      is a path and can not be a url.
    * Ensure the appropriate RewriteBase directives are incorporated
      into the generated apache ``Directory`` and ``.htaccess`` configurations.
