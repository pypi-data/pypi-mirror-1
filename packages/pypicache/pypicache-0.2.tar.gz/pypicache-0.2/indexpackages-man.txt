Build a python package index based on the egg files in the directory specified
by the ``archive/dir argument``. This argument specifies the file
system root directory in which the distributions are stored and where the index
will be built.

Options-Summary:

    Don't write anything to disk: ``--dry-run, -N``

    Page generation::

        --index-url --index-pagename --downloads-path
        --master-template --project-template

    Logging (use ``-N --log-content=INFO`` to preview generated config files)::

        --log-level --log-content

    Config filename control::

        --project-uri-remap



Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --log-level=LOG_LEVEL
                        `[default:INFO]` Sets the logging level for messages
                        issued by this package. It can be a number, or any one
                        of the standard logging level strings "CRITICAL ERROR
                        WARNING INFO DEBUG NOTSET". The level strings
                        correspond, respectively, to the numbers [50, 40, 30,
                        20, 10, 0].  NOTE: Set this options to 50 for *most
                        quiet* or 10 for *most verbose*.  Note that NOTSET
                        will cause the logging level to be taken from the
                        first parent handler that *does* set a level - usualy
                        this will be the root logger
  --log-content=LOG_CONTENT
                        `[default:DEBUG]` Sets the logging level at which the
                        content of generated pages and files will be logged.
                        Valid values are exactly as per the --log-level
                        option, except that value of NOTSET or 0 will have no
                        effect
  --log-config=LOG_CONFIG
                        `[default:DEBUG]` Exactly as per --log-content. But
                        applies, exclusively, to content that represents
                        site/host configuration necessary for the full
                        functionality of the index. (apache, etc)
  --print-log-conf      `[default:False]` Set this flag to print out
                        information reflecting the application of the --log
                        options. Use if you are not seeing the messages you
                        expect.
  -T INDEX_TITLE, --index-title=INDEX_TITLE
                        `[default:generated via gethostname]` The title of the
                        package index. This will be used as the
                        ``<title>CONTENT</title>`` for the master index page.
                        By default this option value is generated using
                        ``gethostname`` like this ``'cheeseboard.%s' %
                        gethostname()``
  -U INDEX_URL, --index-url=INDEX_URL
                        `[default:generated via gethostname]` The public url
                        of the package index main page. By default this option
                        value is generated using ``gethostname`` like this
                        ``'http://cheeseboard.%s/' % gethostname()``. The
                        supplied url must end with ``/`` (trailing slash).
  --downloads-path=DOWNLOADS_PATH
                        `[default:]` Generate download uris with a path that
                        is distinct from the project-path implied by the
                        ``--index-url`` option. If a non empty download-path
                        is supplied then it is joined to the `path` component
                        of the `index-url`.  For a definition of `path`
                        component see `uriparse <http://docs.python.org/lib
                        /module-urlparse.html>`_
  --index-pagename=INDEX_PAGENAME
                        `[default:index.html]` Sets the name of the master
                        index page.
  --project-uri-remap=PROJECT_URI_REMAP
                        `[default:project-index.txt]` Sets the name of the
                        mod_rewrite RewriteMap compatible text file that will
                        contain the necessary *safe_name* re-mappings from
                        project uris to the appropriate project page for the
                        version implied in the uri. If there is no version
                        information in the uri then the remap directs to the
                        BEST VERSION as defined by setuptools semantics for
                        version string interpretation.
  --master-template=MASTER_TEMPLATE
                        `[default:]` Use this option to set the file from
                        which the master index page template will be read. If
                        a relative path is provided it must be relative to
                        ``--index-root``. The file should be a plain text file
                        providing standard %(key)s substitutions for the
                        following keys: index_title, PACKAGE_INDEX_URLS. Note
                        that the keys indicated in this help text may be
                        incorrect if you are running a version of this program
                        that customise the replacement keys. The template file
                        is checked for the presence of the actual keys needed
                        at runtime by the class that generates the page.
  --project-template=PROJECT_TEMPLATE
                        `[default:]` Use this option to set the file from
                        which the project-version page template will be read.
                        If a relative path is provided it must be relative to
                        --index-root. The file should be a plain text file
                        providing standard %(key)s substitutions for the
                        following keys: index_name, project_name,
                        latest_version, DOWNLOAD_LINKS. Note that the keys
                        indicated in this help text may be incorrect if you
                        are running a version of this program that customise
                        the replacement keys. The template file is checked for
                        the presence of the actual keys needed at runtime by
                        the class that generates the page.
  -N, --dry-run         `[default:False]` Set this option to prevent this
                        program from writing anything to disc. This option can
                        be combined with logging options to re-direct most
                        content production to standard out.
  --apache-vhost-file=APACHE_VHOST_FILE
                        `[default:apache2-vhost.directives.conf]` The name of
                        the file to which all server/host level directives are
                        written. These represent the minimum necessary
                        server/host level directives needed in order for the
                        index to work. **NOTE**: If the path is relative then
                        it is relative to the directory specified as the
                        index/root by the first non option argument.
  --apache-dirdirect-file=APACHE_DIRDIRECT_FILE
                        `[default:apache2-dir.directives.conf]` The name of
                        the file to which all <Directory> context directives
                        are written. These represent the minimum necessary
                        ``</Directory>`` directives required in order for the
                        index to work. **NOTE** This program always generates
                        both a directory context config and the equivelent
                        .haccess file. If .htaccess support is enabled
                        (``--enable-htaccess``) then directives that duplicate
                        the .htaccess functionality are commented out. To
                        disable .htaccess at any time, simply make the usual
                        arrangements at the server config level and uncomment
                        the directory context directives.
  --htaccess-file=HTACCESS_FILE
                        `[default:.htaccess]` The name of the file to which
                        the .htaccess configuration directives are written. If
                        `--enable-htaccess` is NOT also specified then the
                        given file name will be decorated with the prefix
                        ``NOTENABLED``.
  --enable-htaccess     `[default:False]` Set this flag to make .htaccess on
                        by default. This script allways generates
                        configuration directives appropriate for use with or
                        without htaccess support enabled. If htaccess support
                        is disabled (this is the default) then all server/host
                        and ``<Directory>`` directives pertaining to htaccess
                        support are commented out and the generated htaccess
                        file is prefixed with ``NOTENABLED``.
