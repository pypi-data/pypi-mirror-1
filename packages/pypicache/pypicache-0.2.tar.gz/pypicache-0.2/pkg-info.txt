:Description: Generate and maintain an easy_install compatible package index.
:Abstract: The main script provides a relatively painless way to convert a 
    single directory of python packages into an easy_install compatible package
    archive.  A typical use would be to expose the contents of your
    PYTHON_EGG_CACHE directory, or your zc.buildout download_cache, to other
    people or computers on your local area network.
