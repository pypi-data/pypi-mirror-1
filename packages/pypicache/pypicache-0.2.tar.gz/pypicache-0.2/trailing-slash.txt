From the package-index-api_:

    3. Omitting the ``/version`` part of a project page's URL (but keeping the
    trailing ``/``) should result in a page that is either:

        a) The single active version of that project, as though the version had
        been explicitly included, OR

        b) A page with links to all of the active version pages for that
        project.

So base/project is not a legitimate resource and should be re-written to
include the trailing slash. Will do this with a redirect provided that:

    * On its own base/project is not found in the project-index re-write map
    * base/project **is* found in the project-index re-write map
