Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --log-level=LOG_LEVEL
                        [default:INFO] Sets the logging level for messages
                        issued by this package. It can be a number, or any one
                        of the standard logging level strings "CRITICAL ERROR
                        WARNING INFO DEBUG NOTSET". The level strings
                        correspond, respectively, to the numbers [50, 40, 30,
                        20, 10, 0].  NOTE: Set this options to 50 for *most
                        quiet* or 10 for *most verbose*.  Note that NOTSET
                        will cause the logging level to be taken from the
                        first parent handler that *does* set a level - usualy
                        this will be the root logger
  --log-content=LOG_CONTENT
                        [default:DEBUG] Sets the logging level at which the
                        content of generated pages and files will be logged.
                        Valid values are exactly as per the --log-level
                        option, except that value of NOTSET or 0 will have no
                        effect
  --log-config=LOG_CONFIG
                        [default:DEBUG] Exactly as per --log-content. But
                        applies, exclusively, to content that represents
                        site/host configuration necessary for the full
                        functionality of the index. (apache, etc)
  --print-log-conf      [default:False] Set this flag to print out information
                        reflecting the application of the --log options. Use
                        if you are not seeing the messages you expect.
  -T INDEX_TITLE, --index-title=INDEX_TITLE
                        [default:generated via gethostname] The title of the
                        package index. This will be used as the
                        <title>CONTENT</title> for the master index page.  By
                        default this option value is generated using
                        ``gethostname`` like this ``'cheeseboard.%s' %
                        gethostname()``
  -U INDEX_URL, --index-url=INDEX_URL
                        [default:generated via gethostname] The public url of
                        the package index main page. The download url hrefs
                        will all explicitly include this url (because
                        easy_install requires it to be so). By default this
                        option value is generated using ``gethostname`` like
                        this ``'http://cheeseboard.%s' % gethostname()``.
  --projects-path=PROJECTS_PATH
                        [default:] Every project link on the master index page
                        will be prefixed with this path.
  --downloads-path=DOWNLOADS_PATH
                        [default:] Every download href - on every project page
                        - will be prefixed with this path.
  --index-pagename=INDEX_PAGENAME
                        [default:index.html] Sets the name of the master index
                        page.
  --project-uri-remap=PROJECT_URI_REMAP
                        [default:project-index.txt] Sets the name of the
                        mod_rewrite RewriteMap compatible text file that will
                        contain the necessary *safe_name* remapings from
                        project uris to the appropriate project page for the
                        version implied in the uri. If there is no version
                        information in the uri then the remap directs to the
                        BEST VERSION as defined by setuptools semantics for
                        version string interpretation.
  --master-template=MASTER_TEMPLATE
                        [default:] Use this option to set the file from which
                        the master index page template will be read. If a
                        relative path is provided it must be relative to
                        --index-root. The file should be a plain text file
                        providing standard %(key)s substitutions for the
                        following keys: index_title, PACKAGE_INDEX_URLS. Note
                        that the keys indicated in this help text may be
                        incorrect if you are running a version of this program
                        that customise the replacement keys. The template file
                        is checked for the presence of the actual keys needed
                        at runtime by the class that generates the page.
  --project-template=PROJECT_TEMPLATE
                        [default:] Use this option to set the file from which
                        the project-version page template will be read. If a
                        relative path is provided it must be relative to
                        --index-root. The file should be a plain text file
                        providing standard %(key)s substitutions for the
                        following keys: index_name, project_name,
                        latest_version, DOWNLOAD_LINKS. Note that the keys
                        indicated in this help text may be incorrect if you
                        are running a version of this program that customise
                        the replacement keys. The template file is checked for
                        the presence of the actual keys needed at runtime by
                        the class that generates the page.
  -N, --dry-run         [default:False] Set this option to prevent this
                        program from writing anything to disc. This option can
                        be combined with logging options to re-direct most
                        content production to standard out.
