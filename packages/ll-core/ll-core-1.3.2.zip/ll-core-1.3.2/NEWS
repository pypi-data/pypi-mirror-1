======================================
Changes in 1.3.2 (released 07/25/2006)
======================================

ll.make.ModuleAction now normalizes line feeds, so that this action can
now be used directly on Windows too.


======================================
Changes in 1.3.1 (released 07/06/2006)
======================================

An option showinfoonly has been added to ll.make.Project (defaulting to
False). This option determines whether actions that run in infoonly
mode are reported or not.


====================================
Changes in 1.3 (released 06/28/2006)
====================================

ll.make has been rewritten. Now there's no longer a distinction between
Targets and Actions. Actions can be chained more easily and creating an
action and registering it with the project are two separate steps.
Actions can no longer be shared, as each action stores its own input
actions (but output actions are not stored). ?Ids? have been renamed to
?keys? (and DBID/OracleID to DBKey/OracleKey). ImportAction has been
renamed to ModuleAction and can now turn any string into a module.

In ll.url modification dates for local files now include microseconds
(if the OS supports it).

A class Queue has been added to ll.misc which provides FIFO queues.

A decorator withdoc has been added to ll.misc that sets the docstring
on the function it decorates.

setuptools is now supported for installation.


====================================
Changes in 1.2 (released 12/13/2005)
====================================

None is now allowed as a proper data object in ll.make actions.

ll.xpit now supports conditionals (i.e. the new processing instruction
targets if, elif, else and endif. Now there must be a space after the
target name.


======================================
Changes in 1.1.1 (released 11/15/2005)
======================================

Fixed a bug in ll.make.Project.buildwithargs.


====================================
Changes in 1.1 (released 10/31/2005)
====================================

ll.make.TOXICAction no longer takes an encoding argument in the
constructor, but works on unicode strings directly.

Two new actions (DecodeAction and EncodeAction) have been added to
ll.make.


======================================
Changes in 1.0.2 (released 10/24/2005)
======================================

Fixed a bug in ll.make.Project.destroy that broke the recreate method.


======================================
Changes in 1.0.1 (released 10/18/2005)
======================================

Fixed a bug in ll.make.Project.__contains__.


====================================
Changes in 1.0 (released 10/13/2005)
====================================

This package now contains the following modules, that have been
distributed as separate packages previously: ansistyle, color, make,
misc (which contains the stuff from the old ll package), sisyphus, url
and xpit.

ll.misc.Iterator now has a method get, that will return a default value
when the iterator doesn't have the appropriate item.

In ll.make the output has been fixed: The showactionfull flag is
checked before the showaction flag and target id's will always be
output in this mode.
