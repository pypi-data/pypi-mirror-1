ll-core 1.2

ll-core is a collection of the following modules:

* ansistyle wraps an output stream and adds color capability
  via ANSI escape sequences.

* color provides classes and functions for handling RGB color values.
  This includes the ability to convert between different color models
  (RGB, HSV, HLS) as well as to and from CSS format, and several functions
  for modifying and mixing colors.

* make is an object oriented make replacement. Like make it allows you
  to specify dependencies between files and actions to be executed
  when files don't exist or are out of date with respect to one
  of their sources. But unlike make you can do this in a object oriented
  way and targets are not only limited to files, but you can implement
  e.g. dependencies on database records.

* misc provides several small utility functions and classes.

* sisyphus provides classes for running Python scripts as cron jobs.

* url provides classes for parsing and constructing RFC 2396
  compliant URLs.

* xpit is a module that makes it possible to embed Python expressions
  in text (as XML style processing instructions).
