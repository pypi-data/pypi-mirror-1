Description: ll-core is a collection of the following modules:
        
        * ``ansistyle`` can be used for colored terminal output (via ANSI
        escape sequences).
        
        * ``color`` provides classes and functions for handling RGB color values.
        This includes the ability to convert between different color models
        (RGB, HSV, HLS) as well as to and from CSS format, and several functions
        for modifying and mixing colors.
        
        * ``make`` is an object oriented make replacement. Like make it allows you
        to specify dependencies between files and actions to be executed
        when files don't exist or are out of date with respect to one
        of their sources. But unlike make you can do this in a object oriented
        way and targets are not only limited to files, but you can implement
        e.g. dependencies on database records.
        
        * ``misc`` provides several small utility functions and classes.
        
        * ``sisyphus`` provides classes for running Python scripts as cron jobs.
        
        * ``daemon`` can be used on UNIX to fork a daemon process.
        
        * ``url`` contains an RFC2396 compliant implementation of URLs and classes for
        accessing resource metadata (like modification dates or permission bits) as
        well as file like classes for reading data from URLs and writing data to URLs.
        
        * ``xpit`` is a module that makes it possible to embed Python expressions
        in text (as XML style processing instructions).
        
        
        Changes in 1.7.3 (released 02/22/2007)
        ======================================
        
        * ll.url.SshConnection now has a new method close which can be
        used to shut down the communication channel. As SshConnection
        no longer stores a reference to the context, this means that
        ssh connections are shut down immediately after the end of the
        context in which they are stored. This avoids a problem with
        hanging threads.
