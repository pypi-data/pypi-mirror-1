<section><title>Changes in 1.3.1 (released 07/06/2006)</title>

<par>An option <option>showinfoonly</option> has been added to
<class>ll.make.Project</class> (defaulting to <lit>False</lit>). This
option determines whether actions that run in <lit>infoonly</lit> mode
are reported or not.</par>

<section><title>Changes in 1.3 (released 06/28/2006)</title>

<par><module>ll.make</module> has been rewritten. Now there's no longer
a distinction between <class>Target</class>s and <class>Action</class>s.
Actions can be chained more easily and creating an action and registering it
with the project are two separate steps. Actions can no longer
be shared, as each action stores its own input actions (but output actions
are not stored). <z>Ids</z> have been renamed to <z>keys</z>
(and <class>DBID</class>/<class>OracleID</class> to
<class>DBKey</class>/<class>OracleKey</class>). <class>ImportAction</class>
has been renamed to <class>ModuleAction</class> and can now turn any
string into a module.</par>

<par>In <module>ll.url</module> modification dates for local files now include
microseconds (if the OS supports it).</par>

<par>A class <class>Queue</class> has been added to <module>ll.misc</module> which
provides FIFO queues.</par>

<par>A decorator <function>withdoc</function> has been added to
<module>ll.misc</module> that sets the docstring on the function it decorates.</par>

<par><module>setuptools</module> is now supported for installation.</par>

<section><title>Changes in 1.2 (released 12/13/2005)</title>

<par><lit>None</lit> is now allowed as a proper data object in
<module>ll.make</module> actions.</par>
<par><module>ll.xpit</module> now supports conditionals (i.e. the new
processing instruction targets <lit>if</lit>, <lit>elif</lit>, <lit>else</lit>
and <lit>endif</lit>. Now there <em>must</em> be a space after the target name.</par>

as separate packages previously: <module>ansistyle</module>,

(which contains the stuff from the old <module>ll</module> package),
<module>sisyphus</module>, <module>url</module> and <module>xpit</module>.</par>

<par><class>ll.misc.Iterator</class> now has a method <method>get</method>, that
will return a default value when the iterator doesn't have the appropriate item.</par>

<par>In <module>ll.make</module> the output has been fixed: The <lit>showactionfull</lit>
flag is checked before the <lit>showaction</lit> flag and target id's will always
