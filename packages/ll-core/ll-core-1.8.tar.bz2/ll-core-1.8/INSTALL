Installation
============

   distutils is used for installation, so it's rather simple. Execute
   the following command:

 python setup.py install

   This will compile the C sources and copy the required files to the
   site-packages directory as part of the ll package.

   For Windows a binary distribution is provided. To install it,
   double click it and follow the instructions.

   setuptools is supported for installation, so if you have
   setuptools installed the package will be installed as an egg.

   If you have difficulties installing this software, send a problem
   report to Walter Dörwald (walter@livinglogic.de).
