Description: ll-core is a collection of the following modules:
        
        *	``ansistyle`` can be used for colored terminal output (via ANSI
        escape sequences).
        
        *	``color`` provides classes and functions for handling RGB color values.
        This includes the ability to convert between different color models
        (RGB, HSV, HLS) as well as to and from CSS format, and several functions
        for modifying and mixing colors.
        
        *	``make`` is an object oriented make replacement. Like make it allows you
        to specify dependencies between files and actions to be executed
        when files don't exist or are out of date with respect to one
        of their sources. But unlike make you can do this in a object oriented
        way and targets are not only limited to files, but you can implement
        e.g. dependencies on database records.
        
        *	``misc`` provides several small utility functions and classes.
        
        *	``sisyphus`` provides classes for running Python scripts as cron jobs.
        
        *	``daemon`` can be used on UNIX to fork a daemon process.
        
        *	``url`` contains an RFC2396 compliant implementation of URLs and classes for
        accessing resource metadata (like modification dates or permission bits) as
        well as file like classes for reading data from URLs and writing data to URLs.
        
        *	``xpit`` is a module that makes it possible to embed Python expressions
        in text (as XML style processing instructions).
        
        *	``xml_codec`` provides a meta codec for decoding XML input.
        
        
        Changes in 1.11 (released 01/07/2008)
        -------------------------------------
        
        *	``root:`` URLs are now treated as local files for purposes of file i/o.
        
        *	:class:`ll.make.ModuleAction` no longer supports modules that fiddle with
        ``sys.modules``.
        
        *	The function :func:`ll.misc.tokenizepi` can be used to split a string
        according to the processing instruction tags in the string (this formerly
        was part of :mod:`ll.xist.xsc`).
        
        *	:mod:`ll.make` has been changed interally to store modification timestamp,
        which should fix the implementation of :class:`PhonyAction` and makes it
        possible to use :class:`PhonyAction` objects as inputs to other actions.
        
        *	:mod:`ll.make` has a new action :class:`ImportAction`. This action doesn't
        take any input. It imports a module specified by name, e.g.
        ``make.ImportAction("cStringIO")`` (Note that you should not import one
        module via :class:`ModuleAction` and :class:`ImportAction` (or a normal
        import) as this will return two different module objects).
        
        *	Make actions don't have the input actions as a constructor parameter any
        longer. The input action can now only be set via :meth:`__div__`.
        
        *	:mod:`ll.make` has been updated to support the actions required by XIST 3.0.
        
        *	The functions :func:`misc.item`, :func:`misc.first`, :func:`misc.last` and
        :func:`misc.count` have been reimplemented in C and should be faster now
        (especally :func:`item` for negative indexes).
        
        *	:class:`misc.Namespace` is gone and has been replaced with :class:`misc.Pool`
        which works similar to the pools use by XIST (in fact XISTs pool class is
        a subclass of :class:`misc.Pool`).
        
        *	The module :mod:`xml_codec` has been added. It contains a complete codec
        for encoding and decoding XML.
