  <h2>Welcome to Desire</h2>
  <p>
  Desire serves two main purposes. Firstly, it provides an effective way
  of conducting, recording and presenting working processes, which are
  analysed in terms of events and the responses made to them. Based on
  such considerations, requirements for a software system can also be
  recorded and associated with the process responses which they support.
  </p><p>
  This analysis approach has been developed and practiced by the
  Appropriate Software Foundation, and has proven effective for numerous
  organisations.
  </p><p>
  The second purpose of the Desire service is to provide a shared space
  for circulating process analysis amongst civil society
  organisations. We offer Desire as a free service, and hope that it
  will be a valuable contribution to the development of communities of
  shared interest in civil society.
