Description: pkginfo README
        ==============
        
        This package provides an API for querying the distutils metadata written in
        the ``PKG-INFO`` file inside a source distriubtion (an ``sdist``), or into
        the ``EGG-INFO`` directory of an installed distribution.
        
        Please see ``docs/index.rst`` for detailed documentation.
        
        
        pkginfo Changelog
        =================
        
        0.4 (2009-05-07)
        ----------------
        
        - Extended the console script to allow output as CSV or INI.  Also, added
        arguments to specify the metadata version and other parsing / output
        policies.
        
        - Added support for the different metadata versions specified in PEPs
        241, 314, and 345.  Distributions now parse and expose only the attributes
        corresponding to their metadata version, which defaults to the version
        parsed from the ``PKG-INFO`` file.  The programmer can override that version
        when creating the distribution object.
        
        0.3 (2009-05-07)
        ----------------
        
        - Added support for introspection of "development eggs" (checkouts with
        ``PKG-INFO``, perhaps created via ``setup.py develop``).
        
        - Added a console script, ``pkginfo``, which takes one or more paths
        on the command line and writes out the associated information.  Thanks
        to ``runeh`` for the patch!
        
        - Added 'get_metadata' helper function, which dispatches a given path or
        module across the available distribution types, and returns a distribution
        object.  Thanks to ``runeh`` for the patch!
        
        - Made distribution objects support iteration over the metadata fields.
        Thanks to ``runeh`` for the patch!
        
        - Made Distribution and subclasses new-style classes.  Thanks to ``runeh``
        for the patch!
