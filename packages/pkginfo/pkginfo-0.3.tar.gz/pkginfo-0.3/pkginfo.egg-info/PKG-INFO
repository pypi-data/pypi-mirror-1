Description: pkginfo README
        ==============
        
        This package provides an API for querying the distutils metadata written in
        the ``PKG-INFO`` file inside a source distriubtion (an ``sdist``), or into
        the ``EGG-INFO`` directory of an installed distribution.
        
        Please see ``docs/index.rst`` for detailed documentation.

        =================
        
        0.3 (2009-05-07)
        ----------------
        
        - Added support for introspection of "development eggs" (checkouts with
        ``PKG-INFO``, perhaps created via ``setup.py develop``).
        
        - Added a console script, ``pkginfo``, which takes one or more paths
        on the command line and writes out the associated information.  Thanks
        to ``runeh`` for the patch!
        
        - Added 'get_metadata' helper function, which dispatches a given path or
        module across the available distribution types, and returns a distribution
        object.  Thanks to ``runeh`` for the patch!
        
        - Made distribution objects support iteration over the metadata fields.
        Thanks to ``runeh`` for the patch!
        
        - Made Distribution and subclasses new-style classes.  Thanks to ``runeh``
        for the patch!
