        A Python interface to XSL-FO libraries.
        
        The packages helps to convert HTML to PDF, RTF, ODT, DOCX and WML using
        XSL-FO technology.
        
        
        Requirements:
        -------------
        
        - Java 1.4.0 or higher (1.5.X or 1.6.X are preferred)
        
        - csstoxslfo (included)
        
        - XFC-4.0 (www.xmlmind.com) for PDF support
        
        - XINC 2.0 (www.lunasil.com) for ODT, RTF, DOCX, WML support
        
        - mxTidy (egenix-experimental package from www.egenix.com)
        
        
        Installation:
        -------------
        
        - install zopyx.convert either using easy_install or by downloading the sources
        
        - $XFC_DIR must be set and point to the root of your XFC installation directory
        
        - $XINC_HOME must be set and to point to the root of your XINC installation directory
        
        
        Subversion repository:
        ----------------------
        
        - http://svn-public.zopyx.com/viewvc/python-projects/zopyx.convert/trunk/
        
        
        Usage:
        ------
        
        > from zopyx.convert import Converter
        > C = Convert('/path/to/some/file.html')
        > pdf_filename = C('pdf')
        > rtf_filename = C('rtf')
        > pdt_filename = C('odt')
        > wml_filename = C('wml')
        > docx_filename = C('docx')
        
        A very simple command-line converter is also available:
        
        > xslfo-convert --format rtf --output foo.rtf sample.html
        
        
        How zopyx.convert works internally:
        -----------------------------------
        
        - The source HTML file is converted to XHTML using mxTidy
        
        - the XHTML file is converted to FO using the great "csstoxslfo" converter
        written by Werner Donne.
        
        - the FO file is passed either to the external XINC or XFC converter to
        generated the desired output format
        
        - all converters are based on Java technology make the conversion solution
        highly portable across operating system (including Windows)
        
        
        Limitations:
        ------------
        
        - Works currently only on Linux/Unix, no Windows support so far
        
        - no image support right now (exceptions will be raised)
        
        
        Why XINC/XFC and not FOP?
        -------------------------
        zopyx.convert is build on the commercial converters XINC/XFC because these
        converters *just work*.  Depending on your needs to must make your choice
        between the several available additions. Why not Apache FOP? FOP has been
        evaluated in 2004 for the conversion to RTF/PDF and it was pretty much unusable
        at that time. Now in 2007 Apache FOP reached version 0.9.3 thinks are looking
        better. However open formats like ODT (Open-Office) and DOCX (Microsoft Office
        2007) have come up and need to be supported. XFC fills the gap by supporting
        RTF, ODT, DOCX and WML.

        0.3.1 (18.06.2007):
        
        - html2fo() and the converter constructor got a new 'encoding'
        parameter in order to specify the input encoding of the
        HTML file. This parameter will be passed down to Tidy in order
        to perform a proper conversion of non-ascii characters.
