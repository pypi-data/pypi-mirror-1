v0.4.0:

    * some backwards-incompatible API changes:
       * replace Esky.install_update(v) with Esky.auto_update().
       * new utility methods Esky.install_version(v)/Esky.uninstall_version(v).
       * rename Esky.fetch_update(v) to Esky.fetch_version(v)
       * merge VersionFinder.prepare_version into VersionFinder.fetch_version
    * made all VersionFinder methods take the target esky as first argument
      (in preparation for differential update support in a later version).
    * added support for freezing with cx_Freeze.
    * improved support for freezing with py2exe:
       * added a few well-known hacks to get it to play nice with common
         third-party packages (win32com, wxPython).
       * implemented a custom chainload() function to avoid using execv().
    * added ability to set the icon on each executable, for freezer
      modules that support it (currently py2exe and cx_Freeze on win32).
    * added more version-handling utility functions: get_all_versions,
      is_version_dir, is_installed_version_dir.
    * made Esky.cleanup() catch and ignore common errors.
    * added support for Python 3 (via distribute's "use_2to3" flag)
    * added a brief tutorial and example application


v0.3.0:

    * added ability to bundle MSVCRT as a private assembly (this is off
      by default, since you must have a valid license to redistribute it).
    * refactored to support multiple freezing backends.
        * added support for freezing with py2exe.
