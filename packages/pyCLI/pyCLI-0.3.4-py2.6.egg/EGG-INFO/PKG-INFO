Description: The ``cli`` package is a framework for making simple, correct command
        line applications in Python. With ``cli``, you can quickly add standard
        `logging`_, `testing`_, `profiling`_ to your CLI apps. To make it easier
        to do the right thing, ``cli`` wraps all of these tools into a single,
        consistent application interface.
