cli makes it easy for your scripts to do everything you know they should
With cli, you no longer have to dig through the standard library to make
your scripts do everything you know they should (log messages, pass unit 
and functional tests, perform well, ...). Instead, cli provides a
simple, consistent interface and encourages you and your scripts to do
the right thing.
