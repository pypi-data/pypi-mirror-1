Writing a Driver
++++++++++++++++

You create an AuthKit auth store driver by implementing the ``IAuthStore`` and ``IAuthStoreDriver`` classes.
The ``IAuthStore`` methods don't need to change and a combined base classs ``AuthStore`` has been created for you so all you need to do is derive your new class from ``AuthStore`` and implement all the methods begining ``_driver_`` documented in the API documentation for `IAuthStoreDriver <class-AuthKit.IAuthStoreDriver.html>`_ .

For example to create an in-memory auth store (probably not very useful) you might start like this::
    
    from authkit import AuthStore
    
    class InMemoryAuthStore(AuthStore):
        def _driver_create_auth_store(self):
            ...

Once you have implemented all the methods described in the  `IAuthStoreDriver <class-AuthKit.IAuthStoreDriver.html>`_ API documentation you will be able to package your class as an extension egg so that it can be used like one of the auth store drivers which AuthKit comes with and can be listed with ``driver_names()``. Note: This facility has not been implemented yet.
