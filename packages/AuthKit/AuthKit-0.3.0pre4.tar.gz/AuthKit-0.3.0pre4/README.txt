AuthKit
+++++++

WARNING: THIS CODE IS NOT PRODUCTION READY

Changes
=======

0.3 

Re-written from scratch to be a modular toolkit for building your own auth
framework rather than an all-in-one solution.
	
0.2

Re-written from scratch so to use SQLAlchemy only, old driver system considered
unnecessary and limiting. Also doesn't fit in with current Pylons
best-practice.

0.1 

Based on the web.auth 0.6 module from www.pythonweb.org, support for SQLObject
driver included
