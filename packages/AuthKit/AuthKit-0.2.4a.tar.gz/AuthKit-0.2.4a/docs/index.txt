AuthKit
+++++++

AuthKit is a series of useful parts that you can use as a whole or with other software to build your own auth system. 

Used as a whole, AuthKit is a complete system for adding authentication and authorisation facilities to your project to manage anything from simple username and password checking to sophisticated systems where multiple users access multiple applications with different permissions. AuthKit supports roles, groups, encrypted passwords, account disabling, sign in history and has an extensible driver interface for different store back-ends.

Documentation
=============

The current documentation is a work in progress and does not yet fully cover the full scope of the package but it will get you started.

Status
======

AuthKit is not finished. It hasn't been used in production yet and will almost certainly have serious bugs.
