        Summary
        =======
        
        *   Built for WSGI applications and middleware
        *   Sophisticated and extensible permissions system
        *   Built in support for HTTP basic, HTTP digest, form, cookie and OpenID
        authentication methods plus others
        *   Easily define users, passwords and roles
        *   Designed to be totally extensible so you can use the components to integrate

        Changes
        =======
        
        0.4 (**svn**)
        
        *** AS A RESULT OF THESE CHANGES THE DOCS ARE CURRENTLY OUT OF DATE ***
        
        * Added support for encrypted passwords
        * Fixed the IE7 bug in digest middleware
        * Adding SSO sub-directory, redirecting API, and CAS auth handler.
        * Fixed binding check to return none, instead of throwing an Exception (for
        performance reasons).
        * Moved start_response check outside of app_iter consumption since it must be
        called by this point to comply with WSGI.
        * Fixed consumption app iter in multi, loading entire response into ram.
        * Adding changelog
        * Added IP and Time based permission objects
        * Started unit tests
        * Extended the user management API and added SQLAlchemy driver and example
        * Restructured the authenticate middleware into induvidual pluggable components
        * Simplified the configuration file system
        * Added OpenID dependencies
        * Removed the larger SQLAlchemy based demos
        * The cookie module uses ``authkit`` as a default cookie name, not ``auth_tkt``.
        Any code which does anything manually with this cookie needs the name changing
        if it wasn't explicitly set to ``auth_tkt`` in the config file.
        
        0.3.0pre5
        
        * Changed the arguments to the authkit.authenticate.middleware() factory. You
        will need to update your middleware setup to use app_conf instead of
        config_paste for the app_conf dictionary.
        
        0.3
        
        * Re-written from scratch to be a modular toolkit for building your own auth
        framework rather than an all-in-one solution.
        
        0.2
        
        * Re-written from scratch so to use SQLAlchemy only, old driver system considered
        unnecessary and limiting. Also doesn't fit in with current Pylons
        best-practice.
        
        0.1
        
        * Based on the web.auth 0.6 module from www.pythonweb.org, support for SQLObject
        driver included
