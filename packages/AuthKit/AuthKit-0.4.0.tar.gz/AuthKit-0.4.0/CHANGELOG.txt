Changes

0.4 (**svn**)

*** AS A RESULT OF THESE CHANGES THE DOCS ARE CURRENTLY OUT OF DATE ***

* Added support for encrypted passwords
* Fixed the IE7 bug in digest middleware
* Adding SSO sub-directory, redirecting API, and CAS auth handler.
* Fixed binding check to return none, instead of throwing an Exception (for
  performance reasons).
* Moved start_response check outside of app_iter consumption since it must be
  called by this point to comply with WSGI.
* Fixed consumption app iter in multi, loading entire response into ram.
* Adding changelog
* Added IP and Time based permission objects
* Started unit tests
* Extended the user management API and added SQLAlchemy driver and example
* Restructured the authenticate middleware into induvidual pluggable components
* Simplified the configuration file system
* Added OpenID dependencies
* Removed the larger SQLAlchemy based demos
* The cookie module uses ``authkit`` as a default cookie name, not ``auth_tkt``.
  Any code which does anything manually with this cookie needs the name changing
  if it wasn't explicitly set to ``auth_tkt`` in the config file.

0.3.0pre5

* Changed the arguments to the authkit.authenticate.middleware() factory. You
  will need to update your middleware setup to use app_conf instead of
  config_paste for the app_conf dictionary.

0.3 

* Re-written from scratch to be a modular toolkit for building your own auth
  framework rather than an all-in-one solution.
	
0.2

* Re-written from scratch so to use SQLAlchemy only, old driver system considered
  unnecessary and limiting. Also doesn't fit in with current Pylons
  best-practice.

0.1 

* Based on the web.auth 0.6 module from www.pythonweb.org, support for SQLObject
  driver included
