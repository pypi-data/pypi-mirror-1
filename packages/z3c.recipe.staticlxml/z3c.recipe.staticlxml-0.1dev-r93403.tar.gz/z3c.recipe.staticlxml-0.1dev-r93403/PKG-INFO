Description: *******************************************************************
        Recipe for building and installing a static version of the lxml egg
        *******************************************************************
        
        This recipe automates the installation of the ``lxml`` python package
        and, additionally, builds it **statically** against dependent libraries
        like ``libxml2``, ``libxlst``.

        Supported options
        =================
        
        The recipe supports the following options:
        
        egg
        Set to the desired lxml egg, e.g. ``lxml`` or ``lxml==2.1.2``
        
        libxslt-url, libxml2-url
        The URL to download the source tarball of these libraries from.  Currently
        defaults to::
        
        http://dist.repoze.org/lemonade/dev/cmmi/libxslt-1.1.24.tar.gz
        http://dist.repoze.org/lemonade/dev/cmmi/libxml2-2.6.32.tar.gz
        
        build-libxslt, build-libxml2
        Set to ``true`` if these should be build.  Needed for a static build.
        
        static-build
        ``true``or ``false``
        
        xml2-loction
        Needed if ``libxml2`` is not built.
        
        xslt-loction
        Needed if ``libxml2`` is not built.
        
        xslt-config
        Path to the ``xslt-config`` binary.  Not needed if ``build-libxslt`` is
        set to true.
        
        xml2-config
        Path to the ``xml2-config`` binary.  Not needed if ``build-libxml2`` is
        set to true.
        
        force
        Set to ``true`` to force rebuilding libraries every time.
        
        
        Example usage
        =============
        
        We'll start by creating a buildout that uses the recipe::
        
        >>> xsltconfig = "foo"
        >>> xml2config = "bar"
        >>> write('buildout.cfg',
        ... """
        ... [buildout]
        ... parts = test1
        ... log-level = INFO
        ... index = http://dist.repoze.org/lemonade/dev/simple
        ...
        ... [test1]
        ... recipe = z3c.recipe.staticlxml
        ... xslt-config = %(xsltconfig)s
        ... xml2-config = %(xml2config)s
        ... """ % locals())
        
        Running the buildout gives us::
        
        >>> system(buildout)
        Installing test1.
        xslt-config: foo
        xml2-config: bar

        ================
        
        - Added ``iconv`` library, which enables fully static builds. This is
        actually a bug in lxml's setup. [seletz]
        - Updated docs, removed junk code [seletz]
        - Added tweaks needed for Mac OS X [seletz]
        - Added basic build steps for liblxml2, libxslt and lxml. [seletz]
        - Created recipe with ZopeSkel [seletz].
