0.5 (2009-03-16)
================

- The recipe checks for an existing egg before doing expensive
  download/compiles. Previously, the check was implicitly done *after*
  compiling libmxl/libxslt. The egg name is printed with a warning to delete
  it if this isn't a proper static egg.  [reinout]

- Fixed readme typos. [seletz]

0.4 (2009-02-18)
================

0.1 (2008-11-27)
