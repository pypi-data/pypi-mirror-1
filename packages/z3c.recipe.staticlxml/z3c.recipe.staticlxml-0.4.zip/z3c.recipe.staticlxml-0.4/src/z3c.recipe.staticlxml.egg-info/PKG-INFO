Description: *******************************************************************
        Recipe for building and installing a static version of the lxml egg
        *******************************************************************
        
        This recipe automates the installation of the ``lxml`` python package
        and, additionally, builds it **statically** against dependent libraries
        like ``libxml2``, ``libxlst``.

        Supported options
        =================
        
        The recipe supports the following options:
        
        **egg**
        Set to the desired lxml egg, e.g. ``lxml`` or ``lxml==2.1.2``
        
        **libxslt-url, libxml2-url**
        The URL to download the source tarball of these libraries from.  Currently
        defaults to::
        
        http://dist.repoze.org/lemonade/dev/cmmi/libxslt-1.1.24.tar.gz
        http://dist.repoze.org/lemonade/dev/cmmi/libxml2-2.6.32.tar.gz
        
        **build-libxslt, build-libxml2**
        Set to ``true`` (default) if these should be build, ``false`` otherwise.
        Needes to be ``true`` for a static build.
        
        **static-build**
        ``true`` or ``false``.  On OS X this defaults to ``true``.
        
        **xml2-loction**
        Needed if ``libxml2`` is not built.
        
        **xslt-loction**
        Needed if ``libxslt`` is not built.
        
        **xslt-config**
        Path to the ``xslt-config`` binary.  Not needed if ``build-libxslt`` is
        set to true.
        
        **xml2-config**
        Path to the ``xml2-config`` binary.  Not needed if ``build-libxml2`` is
        set to true.
        
        **force**
        Set to ``true`` to force rebuilding libraries every time.
        
        
        Example usage
        =============
        
        This is an example buildout::
        
        [buildout]
        parts =
        lxml
        pylxml
        develop = .
        
        log-level = DEBUG
        
        download-directory = downloads
        download-cache = downloads
        
        versions=versions
        
        [versions]
        lxml = 2.1.3
        
        
        [pylxml]
        recipe=zc.recipe.egg
        interpreter=pylxml
        eggs=
        lxml
        
        [lxml]
        recipe = z3c.recipe.staticlxml
        egg = lxml
        
        This will build a ``static`` version of the ``lxml`` egg, that is, it won't have
        any dependencies on ``libxml2`` and ``libxslt``.

        ================
        
        - Fix to prevent rebuilding lxml all the time, thus reducing the lxml tax. [seletz]

        ==================
        
        - Made ``static-build`` default to ``true`` on OS X [seletz]
        - Made ``build-libxslt` and ``build-libxml2`` default to ``true`` [seletz]
        - Document default options [seletz]
