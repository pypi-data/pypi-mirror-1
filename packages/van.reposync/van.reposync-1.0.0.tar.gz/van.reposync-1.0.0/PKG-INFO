Description: Mirror a pypi-style egg repository from a debian APT repository
        
        Disclaimer
        ----------
        
        This package depends on an as-yet-unreleased version of python-apt (0.8) for
        which it seems the only download location is debian's experimental
        distribution. Currently the version there is 0.7.91.
        
        While this code is tested for simple cases, a lot of the different failure
        modes have not been tested. So if it breaks for you, please add your failure to
        the automated tests and submit a patch!
        
        Use
        ---
        
        Doctest setup (so we can test the documentation):
        
        >>> import tempfile, os
        >>> tmp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
        
        >>> from van.reposync import tests
        >>> tests_dir = os.path.dirname(tests.__file__)
        >>> sources1_list = os.path.join(tmp_dir, 'sources1.list')
        >>> open(sources1_list, 'w').write(open(os.path.join(tests_dir, 'sources1.list'), 'r').read() % {'tests_dir': tests_dir})
        
        We provide one binary `van-reposync` which can be run to perform the
        synchronization. The first time it's run, it requires an --apt-sources
        parameter pointing at an apt sources.list file containing the apt-repositories
        you wish to mirror. It is important that the .list file contain matching deb
        and deb-src lines (mirroring needs both binary and source packages):
        
        >>> tests.runit('van-reposync sync --root %s --apt-sources %s' % (tmp_dir, sources1_list))
        
        After it's done, you will see that the directory you pointed the tool at
        contains an apt configuration, buildout configuration and tarballs linked into
        a pypi-style repository.
        
        The next run does not require the apt-sources command, and should be a lot faster:
        
        >>> tests.runit('van-reposync sync --root %s' % tmp_dir)
        
        TearDown
        
        >>> import shutil
        >>> shutil.rmtree(tmp_dir)
