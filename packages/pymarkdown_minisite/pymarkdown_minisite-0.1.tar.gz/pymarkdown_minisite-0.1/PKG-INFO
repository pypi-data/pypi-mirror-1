Description: 
        This example covers a nice setup.py file, which gets name and description for the PyPI from the docstrings in itself as well as in the main file (pymarkdown_minisite.py).
        
        The changelog is automatically extracted from the file Changelog.txt and appended to the long description for the PyPI.
        
        To customize it, you need to change the following:
        - The first line of this files docstring - it will be your name and description in PyPI. You must keep the dash (" - ") as seperator between name and description to make getting name and description work.
        - Every occurrence of "pymarkdown_minisite" in this file to the name of your module
        - Author, author_email, etc. in setup() to your preferred settings.
        - A list of all classifiers can be found via python setup.py register --list-classifiers
        - This docstring to a mainly static description of your program.Things which may change at times should go into your main file (here it's pymarkdown_minisite.py).
        - Your main files docstring, which provides the second paragraph (its first line is ignored).
        
        For updating your PyPI entry to a new version, you only need to change the __version__ parameter in your main file (here it is pymarkdown_minisite.py) and then run "python setup.py register" (no file release) or "python setup.py register sdist upload" to include a file release (sources).
