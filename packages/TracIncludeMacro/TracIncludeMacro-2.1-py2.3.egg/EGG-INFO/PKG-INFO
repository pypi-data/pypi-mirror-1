Description: Notes
        =====
        
        This macro lets you include various things.
        
        Currently supported sources:
        
        * HTTP - ``http:`` and ``https:``
        * FTP - ``ftp:``
        * Wiki pages - ``wiki:``
        * Repository files - ``source:``
        
        The default source is ``wiki`` if only a source path is given.
        
        An optional second argument sets the output MIME type, though in most
        cases the default will be correct.
        
        Permissions
        ===========
        
        The three remote sources (``http``, ``https``, and ``ftp``) require
        ``INCLUDE_URL`` to be rendered.
        
        Anyone can add a call to these, however they will not be shown. This is
        **not** a replacement for ``render_unsafe_content``, see below.
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        If ``[wiki] render_unsafe_content`` is off (the default), any produced
        HTML will be sanitized.
        
        :warn: This is a potential security risk! Please review the implications
        ``render_unsafe_content`` before using this feature.
        
        To enable the plugin::
        
        [components]
        includemacro.* = enabled
        
        Example
        =======
        
        Include another wiki page::
        
        [[Include(PageName)]]
        
        Include a reStructuredText__ file from the repository::
        
        [[Include(source:trunk/docs/README, text/x-rst)]]
        
        __ http://docutils.sf.net/rst.htm
        
        :tip: If you set the ``svn:mime-type`` property on the file, you can
        leave off the explicit MIME type.
