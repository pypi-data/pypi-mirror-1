Currently cifit only supports OSX (partly) and Debian & Ubuntu (systems with apt installed).

see docs/API.txt for the things given to you for free.

The idea behind this code is that you write a config file (.cft) that is in python, but you only run the code thru cifit.

Doing this gives you a bunch of built-ins that make managing systems easier.

Normally I run cifit from crontab every 5 minutes.

You should put your configs in a Version Control system (say subversion)  then it's also easy to update configs:

cft automatically puts the current directory to the basename of the .cft file that cifit runs, so to do a svn update:

files.run('svn update')

it's easy to manage your system or pear packages:

packages = ['apache2','ssh','php5']
for p in packages:
	pkg.installPackage(p)


it's easy to change or update your files: (on multiple runs it will not append it twice).
	files.append('/etc/issue',['This system is managed by cifit'])

It's easy to use sed like replacements on a file.
for example to turn magic_quotes off:
	files.sub("/etc/php5/apache2/php.ini",["/magic_quotes_gpc = On/magic_quotes_gpc = Off/"])

It's easy to keep apache running:
	if not procs.checkService('apache2'):
		procs.startService('apache2')
