within your main python file you get a bunch of stuff for free:


Classes (things to do if statements on, to make decisions.)
	hostname: the local machine's hostname
	hour: The current hour
	dow: The current day of the week
	platform: The current computer's platform

You can define your own classes simply by doing this:
	classes.classes[Key] = Value
	Changes you make are instantly available to you.

functions:
	FILES:
		run(cmd)

			append is way to append lines in files if the line is not already in the file (exact match only)
		sub(files,subs,out='REPLACE')
			sub is a sed-like subsitution for lines in files.
				
	PROCESSES:
		stop_service(svcname)
