Changes in 0.11

* Fixed bug on windows when the full path of nonforking.py contains a
  space.

* On unix there is no longer a need to make the arguments to the
  constructor of Process be picklable or for and instance of a
  subclass of Process to be picklable when you call the start method.

* On unix proxies which a child process inherits from its parent can
  be used by the child without any problem, so there is no longer a
  need to pass them as arguments to Process.  (This will never be
  possible on windows.)
