Description: 
        Package for using processes which mimics the threading module, and
        allows the sharing of objects between processes.  Communication
        between processes happens via sockets or named pipes.
        
        The 'processing.Process' class follows the API of 'threading.Thread'.
        One can also use a manager to create shared objects.  The types
        supported by default are: Lock, RLock, Condition, Event, Semaphore,
        BoundedSemaphore, Queue, list, dict, set.  For example
        
        >>> from processing import Manager, Repr
        >>> manager = Manager()
        >>> l = manager.list(range(10))
        >>> l.reverse()
        >>> print l
        <Proxy[list] object at 0x00c33470)>
        >>> print Repr(l)
        [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
