============================================
 Installation of the ``processing`` package
============================================

If you have the correct C compiler setup then the source distribution
can be installed the usual way::

   python setup.py install

Without the C compiler you can skip compilation of the C-extensions in
the ``connection`` sub-package by instead doing ::

   python setup.py build_py install --skip-build

Everything should work the same (but slower) except that on Windows
normal sockets will be used for communication between processes
instead of named pipes.

Binary Windows builds for Python 2.4 and Python 2.5 are also available
at

    http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/processing


Running test scripts
--------------------

To run the test scripts using Python 2.5 do ::

    python -m processing.test

on earlier versions do ::

    python -c "from processing.test import main; main()"

This will run each test script twice: once using processes and once
using threads.
