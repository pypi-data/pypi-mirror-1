Description: 
        Package for using processes which mimics the threading module, and
        allows the sharing of objects between processes.  Communication
        between processes happens via sockets or (on Windows) named pipes.
        
        The ``processing.Process`` class follows the API of ``threading.Thread``.
        One can also use a *manager* to create shared objects.  The types
        supported by default are ::
        
        Lock, RLock, Condition, Event, Semaphore,
        BoundedSemaphore, Queue, list, dict, Namespace.
        
        For example::
        
        >>> from processing import Manager
        >>> manager = Manager()
        >>> l = manager.list(range(10))
        >>> l.reverse()
        >>> print l
        [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
        >>> print repr(l)
        <Proxy[list] object at 0x00E1B3B0>
        
        After installation you can run the test scripts by doing either ::
        
        python -m processing.test
        
        on Python 2.5 or ::
        
        python -c "from processing.test import main; main()"
        
        on earlier versions.  This will run each test script twice: once using
        processes and once using threads.
        
        See ``README.txt`` and ``doc/index.html`` for more information.
