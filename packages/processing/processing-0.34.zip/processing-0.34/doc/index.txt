Description
===========

The `processing` package is intended to be an analogue of the
`threading` module, but using processes instead of threads.  It runs
on both Windows and Unix.  A sub-package `processing.dummy` has the
same API, but is a thin wrapper around `threading`.

Communication between processes uses sockets or named pipes.
Synchronization primitives are built around the platform's mutexes and
semaphores.  

Data can be shared between processes either by using shared memory or
by using proxies to objects in a server process.
