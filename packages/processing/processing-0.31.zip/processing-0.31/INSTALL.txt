==========================================
 Installation of the `processing` package
==========================================

If you are using Windows then binary builds for Python 2.4 and Python 2.5 
are available at

    http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/processing

Otherwise, if you have the correct C compiler setup then the source
distribution can be installed the usual way::

   python setup.py install

Note that Linux is the only unix on which `processing` has been
tested.  On other unices (or older versions of Linux) it may be
necessary to edit `setup.py` to disable support for posix message
queues and perhaps also posix named semaphores.  The part to edit
reads ::

    macros = dict(
        USE_SENDFD=1,
        USE_POSIX_SEMAPHORE=1,
        USE_POSIX_QUEUE=1
        )
    libraries = ['rt']

Note that if you set `USE_POSIX_SEMAPHORE=0` then many of the
functions in the `processing` namespace like `Lock()`, `Queue()` or
`LocalManager()`.  However, one can still create a server process
manager using `manager = processing.Manager()` and then do `lock =
manager.Lock()` etc.

If necessary you can skip compilation of the C extension completely by
doing ::

   python setup.py build_py install --skip-build


Running test scripts
--------------------

To run the test scripts using Python 2.5 do ::

    python -m processing.test

on earlier versions do ::

    python -c "from processing.test import main; main()"

This will run each test script twice: once using processes and once
using threads.
