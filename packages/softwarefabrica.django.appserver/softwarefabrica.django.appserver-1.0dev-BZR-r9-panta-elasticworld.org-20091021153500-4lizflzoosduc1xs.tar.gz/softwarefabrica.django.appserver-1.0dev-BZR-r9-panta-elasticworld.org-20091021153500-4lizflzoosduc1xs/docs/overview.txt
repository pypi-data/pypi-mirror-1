What is this?
=============

This package is a stand-alone wrapping of CherryPy WSGI server to serve Django
applications without the need of an external web server.
This work has been inspired by the articles of `Eric Florenzano`_, `Steven Wilcox`_,
and by `DjangoCerise`_ (by Loic d'Anterroches). Some code is derived directly by `DjangoCerise`_.
