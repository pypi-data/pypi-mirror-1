        What is this?
        =============
        
        This package is a stand-alone wrapping of CherryPy WSGI server to serve Django
        applications without the need of an external web server.
        This work has been inspired by the articles of `Eric Florenzano`_, `Steven Wilcox`_,
        and by `DjangoCerise`_ (by Loic d'Anterroches). Some code is derived directly by `DjangoCerise`_.
