Changes
-------

0.6 (2009-06-10)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Introduce the notion of ``CompileError`` and ``RenderError``.  A
  ``CompileError`` should be raised by a template if the template
  cannot be parsed or compiled. A ``RenderError`` should be raised if
  there is any run-time error during template rendering.

* Introduce ``render`` in the API and de-emphasize the use of ``lookup``.
  Normally templates are rendered by calling ``render``.

* When a template is looked up and there is a ``CompileError`` during
  its creation, fall back on original template.

* When a template is rendered using the top-level ``render`` function
  and there is a ``RenderError`` during the rendering process, fall
  back on the original template.

* Remove ``original_source`` and ``samples`` methods from
  ``IManagedTemplate`` interface. These are better handled by directly
  using the ``ITemplateDatabase`` API.

* Some fixes in the interfaces, bringing them more inline with the code.

* Expose ``collection``, ``next_collection`` and ``root_collection``
  functions.
