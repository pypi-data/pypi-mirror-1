Some ideas
==========

* each collection is registered under an id, not equal to the path.

* a collection could also have a display title

* templates are identified using collection id + template path

* a collection id could be based on a dotted name + template dir name
  (up to the system, but provide utility functionality for this?)

* a Grok CustomizableView would automatically register the collection if
  necessary, and hooks into the template lookup system.
  (megrok.custom) (megrok.custom.Collection?)
