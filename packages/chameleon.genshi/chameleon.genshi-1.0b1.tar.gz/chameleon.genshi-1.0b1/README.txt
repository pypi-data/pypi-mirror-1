Overview
========

This package provides a fast Genshi template implementation based on
the Chameleon template compiler. It's largely compatible with
``genshi.template``.

Compiler notes
--------------

1. Match templates defined in included templates are not applied to
the calling document.

Development
-----------

If you want to use the code directly from trunk (recommended only for
development and testing usage), provide ``chameleon.genshi==dev`` as your
dependency.
