in no particular order, some notes on things that I think ought to happen to this code:

 * Profiling.  As far as I know, none has been done, and I expect that the code is *very* slow. Then, obviously, optimizations should be considered.
   See also http://mail.zope.org/pipermail/zope-dev/2009-February/034866.html
 * Documentation.  I'm trying to keep user and developer documentation both up-to-date and helpful, but I'm not sure I'm doing a very good job of
   keeping it helpful.  Please let me know what's missing or unclear.
 * I want to figure out how to make a PasteScript template to auto-generate the entry point for a plugin package, but I never seem to find the time
   to learn how to write PasteScript templates.
 * Better debugging tools/APIs are one of my highest priorities for this package in the short and long term.  I'd like to make it very easy to see
   what will be autoincluded, turn on and off autoinclusion for individual packages, and freeze a ZCML file to capture static autoinclusion information
   (a la pip).

One day I also want to add another directive(s) to autoinclude subpackages' ZCML; this is a frequent annoyance for me (see
https://svn.openplans.org/svn/opencore/trunk/opencore/configuration/configure.zcml for an illustrative example)
