Introduction
============

Simple integration of jqueryui in Plone, like collective.js.jquery.

It is different from collective.jqueryui in many ways:

* no skin dirs (js and css are in resource dirs)
* no all the bunch of files and documentations from original jqueryui
* this one is minified
* just add all jqueryui to portal_js, and default css to portal_css
