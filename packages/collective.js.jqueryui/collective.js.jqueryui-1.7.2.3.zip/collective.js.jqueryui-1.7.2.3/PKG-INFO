Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Simple integration of jqueryui in Plone, like collective.js.jquery.
        
        It is different from collective.jqueryui in many ways:
        
        * no skin dirs (js and css are in resource dirs)
        * no all the bunch of files and documentations from original jqueryui
        * this one is minified
        * just add all jqueryui to portal_js, and default css to portal_css (if you apply the profile)
        
        Notes
        =====
        
        Plone3.3 include the last JQuery (1.3.2). So please update your products to use the JQuery included in Plone, or you will include it twice.
