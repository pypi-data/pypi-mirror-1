Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Simple integration of jqueryui in Plone, like collective.js.jquery.
        
        It is different from collective.jqueryui in many ways:
        
        * no skin dirs (js and css are in resource dirs)
        * no all the bunch of files and documentations from original jqueryui
        * this one is minified
        * just add all jqueryui to portal_js, and default css to portal_css (if you
        apply the profile)
        
        Notes
        =====
        
        Plone 3.3 include the last JQuery (1.3.2). But collective.js.jquery doesn't
        add it, it replace it.
        Changelog

        --------------------
        
        * Add profile ``withjqtools``, a profile registering the jquery UI bundle
        without the ``tabs`` plugin. This plugin conflicts with the same plugin
        from jquery tools. Note that ``plone.app.jquerytools`` must be availabe in
        your system, since it's profile is applied as dependency. It's not added
        to the setup dependencies of this package. [rnix]
