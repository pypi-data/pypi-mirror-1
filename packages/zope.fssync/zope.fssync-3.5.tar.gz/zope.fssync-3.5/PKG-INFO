Description: zope.fssync Package
        ===================
        
        This package provides filesystem synchronization utilities for Zope
        3. It is used by the zope.app.fssync package.
        
        See src/zope/fssync/README.txt for the details.
        
        
        Changes
        =======
        
        3.5
        ---
        
        - Added the support for empty directories in snarf format. Now
        directories can be explicitly described by snarf.
        
        - Synchronizers can now return callbacks from the load
        method. This allows for fix ups to be run later. This is useful
        when adding multiple objects at the same time that depend on
        each other. Callbacks can in turn return callbacks.
        
        - Add support to FSMerger to allow locally modified files to be
        overwritten by files returned from the server. The purpose of
        this is to avoid conflicts after commit on files that are
        formatted differently on the server from local versions.
        
        3.4.0b1
        -------
        
        Refactoring of zope.fssync and zope.app.fssync into two clearly
        separated packages:
        
        - zope.fssync contains now a Python API that has no critical dependencies
        on Zope, the ZODB, and the security machinery.
        
        - zope.app.fssync contains a protected web-based API and special
        synchronizers for zope.app content types.
        
        Other major changes are
        
        - synchronizers (i.e. serialization/de-serialization adapters) are created
        by named utilities which use dotted class names as lookup keys
        
        - added doctests
        
        - support for large files
        
        - adapters for pickler, unpickler and handling of persistent pickle ids
        
        - binaries are no longer merged
        
        - case-insensitive filesystems and repositories use disambiguated names on
        export and the original names on import
        
        - export and import of directly provided interfaces
        
        - direct export to archives/direct import from archives
        
        - addressed encoding problems on Mac OSX
