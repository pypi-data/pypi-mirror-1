PickleShare - a small 'shelve' like datastore with concurrency support

Like shelve, a PickleShareDB object acts like a normal dictionary. Unlike 
shelve, many processes can access the database simultaneously. Changing a 
value in database is immediately visible to other processes accessing the 
same database.

Concurrency is possible because the values are stored in separate files. Hence
the "database" is a directory where *all* files are governed by PickleShare.

Example usage::
    
    from pickleshare import *
    db = PickleShareDB('~/testpickleshare')
    db.clear()
    print "Should be empty:",db.items()
    db['hello'] = 15
    db['aku ankka'] = [1,2,313]
    db['paths/are/ok/key'] = [1,(5,46)]
    print db.keys()

This module is certainly not ZODB, but can be used for low-load 
(non-mission-critical) situations where tiny code size trumps the 
advanced features of a "real" object database.

Version note: this is an early beta version of the module. It has been tested (and works)
in Linux, extensive Windows testing to follow. This will probably end up as 
the interactive persistence system for IPython 0.7.2+, to make inter-ipython-session
data sharing possible in real time.

A 'pickleshare' script will be installed for "administration"/testing.
