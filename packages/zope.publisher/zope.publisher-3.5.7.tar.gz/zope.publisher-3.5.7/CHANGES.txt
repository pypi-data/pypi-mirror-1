CHANGES
=======

3.5.7 (2009-04-06)
------------------

- Move any ``QUERY_STRING`` submitted with a POST request to a new key in
  the environment, ``X-POST-QUERY_STRING``, to prevent the Python 2.6 version
  of ``cgi.FieldStorage`` from concatenating it onto the form data.

- Pin buildout to the Zope 3.4.0 KGS index.

3.5.6 (2009-02-14)
------------------

Bugs fixed:

* An untested code path that incorrectly attempted to construct a NotFound was
  fixed, with a test.


3.5.5 (2009-02-04)
------------------

* LP #322486: setStatus() now allows any int()-able status value.


3.5.4 (2008-09-22)
------------------

Bugs fixed:

* LP #98440: interfaces lost on retried request

* LP #273296: dealing more nicely with malformed HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE headers
  within getPreferredLanguages().

* LP #253362: dealing more nicely with malformed HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET headers
  within getPreferredCharsets().

* LP #98284: Pass the ``size`` argument to readline, as the version of
  twisted used in zope.app.twisted supports it.

* Fix the LP #98284 fix: do not pass ``size`` argument of None that causes
  cStringIO objects to barf with a TypeError.


3.5.3 (2008-06-20)
------------------

Bugs fixed:

* It turns out that some Web servers (Paste for example) do not send the EOF
  character after the data has been transmitted and the read() of the cached
  stream simply hangs if no expected content length has been specified.


3.5.2 (2008-04-06)
------------------

Bugs fixed:

* A previous fix to handle posting of non-form data broke handling of
  form data with extra information in the content type, as in::

    application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8

3.5.1 (2008-03-23)
------------------

Bugs fixed:

* When posting non-form (and non-multipart) data, the request body was
  consumed and discarded. This makes it impossible to deal with other
  post types, like xml-rpc or json without resorting to overly complex
  "request factory" contortions.

* https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope2/+bug/143873

  The zope.publisher.http.HTTPCharsets was confused by the Zope 2
  publisher, which gives missleading information about which headers
  it has.

3.5.0 (2008-03-02)
------------------

Features added:

* Added a PasteDeploy app_factory implementation.  This should make
  it easier to integrate Zope 3 applications with PasteDeploy.  It
  also makes it easier to control the publication used, giving far
  greater control over application policies (e.g. whether or not to
  use the ZODB).

3.4.2 (2007-12-07)
------------------

* Made segmentation of URLs not strip (trailing) whitespace from path segments
  to allow URLs ending in %20 to be handled correctly. (#172742)

3.4.1 (2007-09-29)
------------------

No changes since 3.4.1b2.

3.4.1b2 (2007-08-02)
--------------------

* zope.publisher now works on Python 2.5.

* Fix a problem with request.get() when the object that's to be
  retrieved is the request itself.


3.4.1b1 (2007-07-13)
--------------------

No changes.


3.4.0b2 (2007-07-05)
--------------------

* Fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/122054:
  HTTPInputStream understands both the CONTENT_LENGTH and
  HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH environment variables. It is also now tolerant
  of empty strings and will treat those as if the variable were
  absent.


3.4.0b1 (2007-07-05)
--------------------

* Fix caching issue. The input stream never got cached in a temp file
  because of a wrong content-length header lookup. Added CONTENT_LENGTH
  header check in addition to the previous used HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH. The
  ``HTTP_`` prefix is sometimes added by some CGI proxies, but CONTENT_LENGTH
  is the right header info for the size.

* Fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/98413:
  HTTPResponse.handleException should set the content type


3.4.0a1 (2007-04-22)
--------------------

Initial release as a separate project, corresponds to zope.publisher
from Zope 3.4.0a1
