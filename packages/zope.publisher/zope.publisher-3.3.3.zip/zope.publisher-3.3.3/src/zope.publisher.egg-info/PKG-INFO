Description: Overview
        --------
        
        zope.publisher allows you to publish Python objects on the web.  It
        has support for plain HTTP/WebDAV clients, web browsers as well as
        XML-RPC and FTP clients.  Input and output streams are represented by
        request and response objects which allow for easy client interaction
        from Python.  The behaviour of the publisher is geared towards WSGI
        compatibility.

        it has.
