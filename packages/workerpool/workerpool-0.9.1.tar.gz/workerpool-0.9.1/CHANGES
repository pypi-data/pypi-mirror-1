Changes
=======

0.9.1
-----

* Changed ``WorkerPool.map`` to behave more like Python's built-in `map` method.
  In consequence, you can no longer define a custom job class to be used by the
  ``WorkerPool.map`` method. This will probably change before a 1.0 release.
* Added a unit test for the new ``WorkerPool.map`` functionality.


0.9
---

* Initial public release.
