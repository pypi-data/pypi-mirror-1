Description: Performing tasks in many threads made fun!
        
        This module facilitates distributing simple operations into jobs that are sent to worker threads, maintained by a pool object.
        
        It consists of these components:
        
        1. Jobs, which are single units of work that need to be performed.
        2. Workers, who grab jobs from a queue and perform them.
        3. Worker pool, which keeps track of workers and the job queue.
