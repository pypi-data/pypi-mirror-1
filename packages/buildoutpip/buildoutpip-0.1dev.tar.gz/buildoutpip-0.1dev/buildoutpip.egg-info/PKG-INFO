Description: This is a buildout extension that allows to buildout from a pip requirements file.
        
        This was created very quickly to show my friend that it could be done. I don't need this right now,
        but I can see this being very useful for Pinax users.
        
        TODO:
        * allow to open local requirements
        * implement -e and -f requirements options
        * write tests
        
        Here is an example of a buildout file.
        
        [buildout]
        extensions = buildoutpip
        requirements =
        http://github.com/pinax/pinax/raw/master/requirements/0.7/release.txt
        parts = pip
        eggs =
        
        [pip]
        recipe=zc.recipe.egg
        eggs = ${buildout:eggs}
