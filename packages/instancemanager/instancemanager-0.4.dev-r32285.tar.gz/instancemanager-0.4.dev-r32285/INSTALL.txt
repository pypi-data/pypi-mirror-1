Instancemanager can be installed using the normal 'python setup.py
install' magic. Note that (at least on my computer), the actual
'instancemanager' script gets installed somewhere deep in the python
library directory instead of in a normal executable place. To remedy
that, do something like::

  sudo python setup.py install --install-script=/usr/local/bin

The first time you run instancemanager (just type 'instancemanager'
and press Enter), it creates a '.instancemanager' directory in your
home directory. There you'll find a 'userdefaults.py' that you can
customise to your local needs.

Following that, create a file called '<yourproject>.py' (can be empty)
in the '.instancemanager/' directory, customising that perhaps with
project-specific settings (just copy the few items that you want to
change from 'userdefaults.py'). Then you're set for typing in
'instancemanager --create yourproject'. Or perhaps even handier,
'instancemanager yourproject fresh', as that does everything from
creating the instance to installing your products.

Instancemanager creates an 'instancemanager.log' logfile in
'~/.instancemanager/', btw, should you want to get an information
overload about what's going on. (The first time you run it, it creates
the logfile in the current directory as '~/.instancemanager' doesn't
exist yet).

If you want the bash shell to complete your instancemanager commands,
read the instruction on the top of the bash_completion file.
