  I started this project, based on per-project shell scripts I wrote
  for a couple of company projects. They improved from project to
  project, but it was a lot of work to back-port the improvements: so
  I made it into a separate program. That way, it can also be useful
  to others.

  I took the basic quickinstall script that Reinout wrote for use
  inside Plone and extended that to be smarter about which Products
  actually get upgraded.  In everyday use of instancemanager, if I
  note some small things that itch me, I scratch them and commit.

  Added the backup / restore action which allows you to make an online
  backup of your running instance database to a location you can set
  in project.py.
