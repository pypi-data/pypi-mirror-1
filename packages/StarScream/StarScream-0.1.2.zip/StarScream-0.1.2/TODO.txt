- Crap the binary egg doesn't contain the scripts directory that holds all the javascript files! It'sd probably not included because setuptools knows it isn't a module. Need to fix this ASAP.
- I don't think the dimensions plugin is necessary for the latest version of jQuery
- Add a BSD license thingee at the top of each script file
- Add a JavaScript timer that changes a band on the top right (which fills up when the time on the slide has been exceeded)

Images are a problem because, oftentimes, you want them to be resized to fit the area that you're displaying them in. However, Firefox does not do bicubic interpolation, so resized images sometimes look terrible (enough for people to notice? eh, maybe not). The solution might be to display images through flash instead (but wouldn't performance take a huge dive?).

Should there be a tool that helps you pick out compatible text and background colors?

It would be nice to have an author's copy of the handout generated as well. But I don't feel like worrying about that for the first release.
