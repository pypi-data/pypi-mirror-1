- I think the title slide also needs to be zoomable (sometimes it gets too large)
- I don't think the dimensions plugin is necessary for the latest version of jQuery
- Can't we get some kind of gradient effect on the header text?
- Add a JavaScript timer that changes a band on the top right, which fills up when the time on the slide has been exceeded (now I'm sure that this is a good idea, at least for practice sessions)
- Images should fit themselves to the available space, if they are only element on the slide. If they are not, then I don't know.

An interesting way to handle resizing of images might be by using the canvas tag. Also, I think good gradient effects can only be achieved through usage of the canvas tag.

You ought to be able to do some nifty transitions using canvas as well.

Should there be a tool that helps you pick out compatible text and background colors?

It would be nice to have an author's copy of the handout generated as well. But I don't feel like worrying about that for the first release.
