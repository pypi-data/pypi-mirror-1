Description: Overview
        ========
        
        This is a recipe to set up and configure Hudson_ in a Jetty_ servlet container.
        
        .. _Hudson : http://hudson-ci.org/
        .. _Jetty : http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/
        
        
        Basic setup
        -----------
        
        A basic buildout configuration using this recipe looks like this::
        
        [buildout]
        
        develop =
        eggs =
        
        parts =
        jetty-download
        hudson-download
        hudson
        
        [jetty-download]
        recipe = gocept.download
        url = http://download.eclipse.org/jetty/stable-7/dist/jetty-distribution-7.0.1.v20091125.tar.gz
        md5sum = b29813029fbbf94d05e1f28d9592813f
        strip-top-level-dir = true
        
        [hudson-download]
        recipe = gocept.download
        url = http://hudson-ci.org/download/war/1.348/hudson.war
        md5sum = 20e2e5c91784e05bf0757d3abacd1687
        
        [hudson]
        recipe = collective.recipe.hudson
        jetty-location = ${jetty-download:location}
        hudson-location = ${hudson-download:location}
        
        
        This will download both Jetty and Hudson and create an executable Jetty
        environment in ``parts/hudson``. It will also create a control script in
        ``bin/hudson``. The name of the script is the name of the section.
        
        To test the setup run ``bin/hudson fg`` and check the console output. By default
        this will run a Jetty server on port 8070. The hudson instance is accessible in
        a browser at ``http://127.0.0.1:8070/hudson/``.
        
        Hudson will write all its log files into ``var/hudson/log``. All its
        configuration included jobs and past runs will go into ``var/hudson/data``. The
        directory name in ``var`` will have the name of the recipe section.
        
        
        Options
        -------
        
        The recipe supports the following options:
        
        host
        Name or IP address of the Jetty server, e.g. some.server.com.
        Defaults to ``127.0.0.1``.
        
        port
        Server port. Defaults to ``8070``.
        
        java-opts
        Optional. Parameters to pass to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) used to
        run Jetty. Each option is specified on a separated line.
        If you run into memory problems it's typical to pass::
        
        [hudson]
        ...
        java-opts =
        -Xms512M
        -Xmx1024M
        ...
