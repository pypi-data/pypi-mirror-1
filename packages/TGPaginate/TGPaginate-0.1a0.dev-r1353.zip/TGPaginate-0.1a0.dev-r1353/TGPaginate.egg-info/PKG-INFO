Description: Still a work in progress.
        This is a branch from the TG paginator that allows multiple paginations and
        support for Ajax.
        
        Right now it's focused on AjaxPaginatedGrid, it's a new widget that interacts
        with the pagination decorator to provide fast access to the data and
        interaction with other scripts. Check the widget browser for a demo.
        Uses Prototype.
        
        Tested and works with Opera, FireFox and IE6 (please report how it behaves with
        other browsers).
