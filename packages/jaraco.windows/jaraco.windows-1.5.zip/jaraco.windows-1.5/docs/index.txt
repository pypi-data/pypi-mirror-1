Changes
-------

1.5
~~~
* NB!! Switched the order of the parameters for symlink and link to match the
  signature found in the os module. This will absolutely break any implementations
  that worked with jaraco.windows prior to 1.5.

1.4
~~~

* Added more robust support for symlink support (including a symlink traversal
  routine that works even when the target is locked). This method uses explicit
  reparse point parsing, using the new reparse module.
* Added support for hardlinks.
* Added jaraco.windows.lib for locating loaded modules.
* Added command line parameters to environ to allow override of default
  append/replace behavior.
* Added power monitoring utilities.
* Began work on GUI testing objects in jaraco.windows.gui.test, based on watsup.
* Added filesystem.GetBinaryType
* Added filesystem.SHFileOperation (useful for sending items to a Recycle Bin).
* Updated enver to support appending to a non-existent variable.
* Added a 'show' option to xmouse
* Added routines to support the Microsoft Data Protection API (DPAPI).

1.3
~~~

* Added -U option to enver

1.2
~~~

* Added this documentation
* Updated the project website to use PYPI directly.
* Improved deployment support (fixes issues with easy_install)
* Fixed issue with PATH and PATHEXT handling in enver.

1.1
~~~

* Added support for persistent environment variable setting (inspired by
  enver.py)

1.0
~~~

* Initial release
* Includes xmouse script for enabling/disabling focus-follows-mouse
