opportunities
=============

The ``opportunities`` attribute contains a list of all of the homepage URLs in the parsed subscription list for which a corresponding feed or subscription list URL was not found.

It is expected that feed readers using listparser can choose to run feed and subscription list autodiscovery software against the list of opportunity URLs.
