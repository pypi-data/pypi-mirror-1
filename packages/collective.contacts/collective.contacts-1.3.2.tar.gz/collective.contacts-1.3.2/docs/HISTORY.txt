Changelog
=========

SVN
----------------

1.3.2
----------------

* Included a custom referencobrowser_popup to show only objects that are
  allowed to be referenced inside the reference browser pop up.
  (Used when relating a person with an organization for example)

1.3.1
----------------

* Fixed display issues with rich text fields

* Added sector and subsector drop downs to the advanced organizations search

* Added a "Go back" link, when doing a quick search.

* [FIXED] was using the same id for translating both work and personal email
  in the search for persons template.
  
* Replaced the way content was retrieved for the views. Now it uses the catalog
  and, in the case of the persons, it uses the advanced query capabilities
  so it will sort using last name first and then first name.

* Added 2 sortable fields to the catalog, one for the last name and the other
  for the first name. They are added and indexed on installation.

* Added types names translation to the old i18n (probably a Plone bug?).

1.3.0
----------------

* Did an override over the contentviews template to workaround a possible bug of Plone when having the default page as a portal_action

* Found a way to get the 'Work' schemata title to be translated to spanish.

* Added some classes to the views, so forms and buttons are hidden when printing

* Added the "Select all" checkbox to all tables.

* Added an uninstall profile.

* When a user has permission to view an address book, it will see the 3
  main tabs with the 3 main views.

* Removed the border when inside a search or a search result. This "fixes"
  the issue where the wrong tab was selected when inside a search or search
  results.

* Added checkboxes to send email and export inside a group view.

* Fixed missing translations under the "Send emails page".

* Added "go back" and "Advanced search" buttons properly when getting or not
  getting search results.

* Finished with the country and states fields, added them to the search
  templates.

* Fixed a typo with the email spanish translation

* Added a note when sending emails about opening the default email client


1.2.0
----------------

* Added Sectors and Sub sectors drop downs to organizations, where you can
  select a "sector" and then the "sub sectors" are automatically updated
  using KSS (Same behaviour as countries and states). This sectors are
  loaded in the address book itself

* Replaced the Country and State text entries with a drop down for all countries
  and, using kss, a drop down with states for each country. This was mainly
  taken from GetPaid, so most of the credit goes for those great gentlemen.

* Title for the group view page

* Moved some fields to the default schemata, so instead of a drop down, they
  are shown as tabs

* Replaced the advanced search link with buttons.

* Fixed a bug with the advanced search. Was giving some errors when searching
  persons based on their organization.

* The import script now imports persons even if they had no organization.

* Quick search feature can now return results if part of a string was
  entered. And if several words are used, it does an OR of all of them.

* Added "No results found" string when no results are found, instead of
  showing an empty table.

* Removed all required fields, only Name and Last name are required for
  persons, and just the name for organizations.

* If persons or organizations have no email set, then the checkbox for sending
  them an email is disabled. Same if a group has no members, or members with
  no email.
