        =========
        
        This product provides an address book where you can add Persons, Organizations and Groups
        
        The address book has 3 customized views, one for Persons, one for Organizations and one for Groups.
        
        The product is fully internationalized, so if you want it in your language, you just need to add another folder to the locales folder and add your language there.
        
        It also features search capabilities, export, import and ability to send mail to several people.
        
        Searching:
        There's a quick search and an advanced search.
        From the quick one, you can put any text and it will show you all users, organizations, or groups that have that text (or part of it) in any of their fields.
        From the advanced one, you can specify text (or part of it) for each field from persons or organizations to do a more precise search.
        
        Export:
        At the moment you can export your persons or organizations to a csv file. It exports all fields from them, you can't filter.
        
        Import:
        You can import Persons or organizations, but csv has to have very precise format, so importing a csv that was exported using this exporter is reccomended.
        
        Sending mail:
        This product does not provide any form to send mails from the portal, what it does is provide you a mailto: with all persons, or organizations that you have selected, so you can send the email with your favorite email client without needing to copy&paste all of them.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.2.0
        ----------------
        
        * Added Sectors and Sub sectors drop downs to organizations, where you can
        select a "sector" and then the "sub sectors" are automatically updated
        using KSS (Same behaviour as countries and states). This sectors are
        loaded in the address book itself
        
        * Replaced the Country and State text entries with a drop down for all countries
        and, using kss, a drop down with states for each country. This was mainly
        taken from GetPaid, so most of the credit goes for those great gentlemen.
        
        * Title for the group view page
        
        * Moved some fields to the default schemata, so instead of a drop down, they
        are shown as tabs
        
        * Replaced the advanced search link with buttons.
        
        * Fixed a bug with the advanced search. Was giving some errors when searching
        persons based on their organization.
        
        * The import script now imports persons even if they had no organization.
        
        * Quick search feature can now return results if part of a string was
        entered. And if several words are used, it does an OR of all of them.
        
        * Added "No results found" string when no results are found, instead of
        showing an empty table.
        
        * Removed all required fields, only Name and Last name are required for
        persons, and just the name for organizations.
        
        * If persons or organizations have no email set, then the checkbox for sending
        them an email is disabled. Same if a group has no members, or members with
        no email.
