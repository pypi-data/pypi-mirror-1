This is webskine, an easy to run weblog that was fun to program.
It uses AJAX calls -- actually, asynchronous JSON requests -- to
create, edit and delete posts in place. Most of the functionality
comes from Paste, Cheetah and jsonstore (on the server side) and
jquery and TinyMCE (on the client side). I also wrote two Python
modules in the process of creating webskine, atomstorage and
jsonstore.

The icons used come from http://www.ndesign-studio.com/resources/pixel_icons.htm
