Description: Overview
        ========
        This is a Trac plugin that adds an admin panel for every custom ticket field that is of type 'select' in the [ticket-custom] section of trac.ini. These panels behave very similarly to the 'Components,' 'Milestones,' 'Priorities,' etc. panels.
        
        Options
        =======
        This plugin allows the following option to be added to the [ticket-custom] section in trac.ini:
        
        <FIELDNAME>.panel = <PANELNAME>
        This is the string that will display as the title of the panel in the left-hand panel selection area in the Trac 'Admin' section.
