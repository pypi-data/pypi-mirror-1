MySQL 5 Pyrex Installation
==========================

This library has the following prerequisites:

- Python 2.4.2 or newer (does not work with 2.5, yet)
- MySQL 5.0.15 or newer (may not work with 5.1)

This library also uses setuptools.  If you do not have setuptools already
installed, the installer will download and automatically install it.

To install, run the following:

    python setup.py install

Note: It will probably take a lot of effort to get this to compile and work on
Windows.  For example, the installer relies on running the mysql_config script
to determine how to link against MySQL.  This does not appear to be included
with the MySQL Windows installation.

Notes
=====
If you get:

The required version of setuptools (>=0.6b3) is not available, and
can't be installed while this script is running. Please install
a more recent version first.
 
Then run (as root):
python ez_setup.py -U setuptools
