Description: This is a MySQL interface for Python that is written in Pyrex.
        
        It is an effort to provide an object-oriented interface to the new Statement
        interface introduced in MySQL 5.  It also provides a specialized interface to
        the "classic" MySQL API that should be extremely easy to use.
        
        It specifically does not conform to the Python DB API (PEP 249).  I wanted to
        express a different style of API.  One could probably make a relatively close
        wrapper, though.
