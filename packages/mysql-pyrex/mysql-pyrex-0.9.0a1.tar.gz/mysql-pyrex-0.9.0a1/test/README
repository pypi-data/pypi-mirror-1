These unittests require a MySQL 5.0 server running on localhost.

Additionally, you will need to add a user with the following command:

    GRANT ALL ON py_mysql_test.* TO py_mysql_test@localhost

The tests will dynamically create the database (called py_mysql_test) as
needed.

Also, the default MySQL priviledges includes an entry that can cause problems
(takes precedence for localhost connections and allows any username to
connect).  To remedy this, do the following:

    DELETE FROM user WHERE user='';
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
