Description: Plone Runscript Recipe
        ======================
        
        Abstract
        --------
        
        This is a buildout recipe for zope/plone which runs a script
        using **zopectl** in a zope instance.
        
        Recipe options
        --------------
        
        instance-home
        The INSTANCE_HOME. This can commonly be found in the ${instance:location}
        buildout variables.
        
        zeo-home
        If you are using a zeo server then you must define this option so zopectl
        can connect to your database.  This can commonly be found in the
        ${zeoserver:location} buildout variable.
        
        script
        The path to the script that will be run. If not specified the script name
        is taken form the part name with a ``.py`` suffix added  and assumed to be
        location in ${buildout:bin-directory}.
        
        args
        The arguments for the script.
        
        The script is run using the instance startup script, which is assumed to be
        named like the basename part of the instance-home directory.

        --------------
        
        - Long overdue release [seletz]
        
        - added support for zeo by adding a 'zeo-home' option which works in the same
        manner as the 'instance-home' option. the zeo is started and then stopped
        once the script has been run. [claytron]
        
        - Document the .py suffix default [wichert]
        
        - Allow specifying a custom script as well [wichert]
        
        - Expand the documentation a little bit [wichert]
