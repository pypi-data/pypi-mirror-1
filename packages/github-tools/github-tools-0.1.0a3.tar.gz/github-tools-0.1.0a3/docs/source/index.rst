Welcome to github.tools' documentation!
========================================

PasteScript template, Paver tasks and Sphinx extension to setup a new package
and easily host it on GitHub (including its documentation).

Setting up a root branch for gh-pages and setting Sphinx html build directory as a repository
is quite complex; especially since Sphinx put its source and static files
in directories named "_static" and "_source" and that gh-pages doesn't want to serve them.

The Sphinx extension (github.tools.sphinx) corrects the last problem; some paver
tasks (github.tools.task.*) take care of creation of a Git submodule to host
the built html documentation; The PasteScript template create the basic layout and
pavement.py script to get started.

This extension requires git (tested with 1.6.2.4), a GitHub user account and 
python 2.5.

Installation:
-------------

Assuming easy_install is installed, simple execute...::

	easy_install github-tools
	
Usage:
------

If you are starting from scratch, create the basic layout with paster::

	paster create -t gh_package <project name>
	
The project name will be used for pypi and for your Github repository
(http://github.com/<user>/<project name>). You can change it later
in your __init__.py package.

To finish your development environment setup, create a virtual environment
and deploy your package in development mode::

	cd <project name>
	python bootstrap.py --no-site-packages
	
The basic package comes with a virtualenv boostrap script
to create an  isolated Python environments. To activate this environment
in your shell, run::

	source ./virtual-env/bin/activate
	# or .\virtual-env\Scripts\activate.bat on windows

Finally::

	paver generate_setup minilib develop.

Paver add a setup.py file to your package and a portable paver library
(required by setup.py), and deploy your application in development mode; the src folder
which contains your package is added to the python path.

You are ready to write your package (in src/) and its ducomentation (in docs/source).
You should probably start tracking your project now::

	git init
	git add .
	git commit -m "initial import"  

When you are ready to share your work, you will need to 
create a repository at GitHub and push your local repository. Paver can do it for you.
Paver will need your GitHub user name and token to create the repository. You can
set them with the following command::

	git config --global github.user <user>
	git config --global github.token <token>
	
You can find your token on you Github account page.

Then, to create the repository and upload your project::

	paver gh_register
	
Once the project is created, you can create your gh-pages branch and upload it to github::

	paver gh_pages_create gh_html
	
Paver will create a submodule of your project at docs/build/html,
create a gh-pages root branch and push the branch to your project.
It then build the html doc. To clean the html build folder, it update the submodule
(you will lose any uncommitted and push changes), remove every files and directory
(except ,git/) and rebuild the documentation. It is your responsibility to push
the new built and to update the submodule reference (a submodule point to specific
commit on a remote repository, not to the HEAD of a specific branch).

When your documentation can be published, simply push  gh-pages submodule to GitHub::

	paver gh_pages_update -m "update docs with..."

You might also want to update the submodule reference::

	git add docs/build/html
	git commit -m "update gh-pages submodule"
