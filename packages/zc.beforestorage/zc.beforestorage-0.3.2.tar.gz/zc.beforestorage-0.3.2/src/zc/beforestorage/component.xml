        The time before which data will be read from the base storage.  This is
        of the form: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSS, where trailing time data is
        optional. That is: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS, YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM,
        YYYY-MM-DDTHH, and YYYY-MM-DD, are all valid forms.   Also valid is
        the case-insensitive string 'now', which is the same as not passing an
        argument.  Also, the case-insensitive argument 'startup' opens the
        storage as of the time at module load.  This is to prevent a possible
        window ibetween the opening of the underlying filestorage and the
        opening of the beforestorage.
