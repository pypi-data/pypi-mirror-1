0.1a3 (2009-08-24)
==================
- Wrote some documentation. More will follow in the next release.
- Removed the Plone egg dependency, because it causes complications with Plone < 3.2.
- Rewrote the tests for the WSAPI calls.
- Fixed the get_workflow call to return only the transitions the current authenticated users can perform.
- Fixed a bug in the Plone service adapter's set_properties method, where the ISO 8601 format wasn't being parsed correctly.
- Removed a few lines that assume CMF type factories and management of objects. This part can be handled by the serviced container object's api, which abstracts the process of creation and deletion.
- The post_object call now derives the to-be-created object's id from the path.
- Modified the get_schema method to fix the Not Found? error. I'm not sure why it wasn't finding the object, but something tells me it has to do with it the transaction not completing.

0.1a2 (2009-07-29)
==================
- Package name change from wsapi4plone to wsapi4plone.core.

0.1a1 (2009-07-08)
==================
- Initial release.
