<h1>About ZContact</h1>
<div class="paragraph">
  <p>ZContact was originally an example application that went along side
  a small course on Zope 3, the web application framework used to write
  ZContact.  The course was taught by Paul Carduner, and is still
  available online at <strong>_fill in the blank_</strong>.</p>
  <p>When the brief course had finished, the example application was
  still quite rudimentary in its functionality.  Jeff Elkner, who
  actually had use for an online contact manager decided to support the
  further development of ZContact into what it is today.</p>
