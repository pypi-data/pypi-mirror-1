Terms
=====

Terms are used to provide choices for sequence widgets or any other construct
needing them. Since Zope 3 already has sources and vocabularies, the base
terms class simply builds on them.

Thus, let's create a vocabulary first:

  >>> from zope.schema import vocabulary
  >>> ratings = vocabulary.SimpleVocabulary([
  ...     vocabulary.SimpleVocabulary.createTerm(0, '0', u'bad'),
  ...     vocabulary.SimpleVocabulary.createTerm(1, '1', u'okay'),
  ...     vocabulary.SimpleVocabulary.createTerm(2, '2', u'good')
  ...     ])

Now we can create the terms object:

  >>> from z3c.form import term
  >>> terms = term.Terms()
  >>> terms.terms = ratings

Getting a term from a given value is simple:

  >>> terms.getTerm(0).title
  u'bad'
  >>> terms.getTerm(3)
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  LookupError: 3

When converting values from their Web representation back to the internal
representation, we have to be able to look up a term by its token:

  >>> terms.getTermByToken('0').title
  u'bad'
  >>> terms.getTerm('3')
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  LookupError: 3

However, often we just want the value so asking for the value that is
represented by a token saves usually one line of code:

  >>> terms.getValue('0')
  0
  >>> terms.getValue('3')
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  LookupError: 3

You can also iterate through all terms:

  >>> [entry.title for entry in terms]
  [u'bad', u'okay', u'good']

Or ask how many terms you have in the first place:

  >>> len(terms)
  3

Finally the API allows you to check whether a particular value is available in
the terms:

  >>> 0 in terms
  True
  >>> 3 in terms
  False

Now, there are several terms implementations that were designed for particular
fields. Within the framework, terms are used as adapters with the follwoing
discriminators: context, request, form, field, and widget.

The first terms implementation is for ``Choice`` fields:

  >>> import zope.schema

  >>> ratingField = zope.schema.Choice(
  ...     title=u'Rating',
  ...     vocabulary=ratings)

  >>> terms = term.ChoiceTerms(None, None, None, ratingField, None)
  >>> [entry.title for entry in terms]
  [u'bad', u'okay', u'good']

A similar terms implementation exists for a ``Bool`` field:

  >>> truthField = zope.schema.Bool()

  >>> terms = term.BoolTerms(None, None, None, truthField, None)
  >>> [entry.title for entry in terms]
  [u'yes', u'no']

Finally, there is a terms adapter for all collections:

  >>> ratingsField = zope.schema.List(
  ...     title=u'Ratings',
  ...     value_type=ratingField)

  >>> terms = term.CollectionTerms(None, None, None, ratingsField, None)
  >>> [entry.title for entry in terms]
  [u'bad', u'okay', u'good']
