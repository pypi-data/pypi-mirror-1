Current supported platforms
===========================

Linux 
-----

It needs kernel 2.4 or higher and the libacl library installed (with
development headers, if installing from rpm). This library is available
on all modern distributions.

The level of compliance is level 2 (see IMPLEMENTATION), plus some extra
functions; and as my development is done on Linux, I try to implement
these extensions when it makes sense.


FreeBSD
-------

The current tested version is 7.0. FreeBSD supports all the standards
functions, but 7.0-RELEASE seems to have some issues regarding the
acl_valid() function when the qualifier of an ACL_USER or ACL_GROUP
entry is the same as the current uid. By my interpretation, this should
be a valid ACL, but FreeBSD declares the ACL invalid. As such, some
unittests fail on FreeBSD.


Other platforms
---------------

For any other platforms, volunteers are welcome - read the PORTING file.
