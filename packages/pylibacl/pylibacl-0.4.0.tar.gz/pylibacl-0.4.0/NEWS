Version 0.4
===========

License
-------

Starting with this version, pylibacl is licensed under LGPL 2.1,
Febryary 1999 or any later versions (see README and COPYING).

Linux support
-------------

A few more Linux-specific functions:

- add the ACL.equiv_mode() method, which will return the equivalent
  octal mode if this is a basic ACL and raise an IOError exception
  otherwise

- add the acl_extended(...) function, which will check if an fd or path
  has an extended ACL

FreeBSD support
---------------

FreeBSD 7.x will have almost all the acl manipulation functions that
Linux has, with the exception of __getstate__/__setstate__. As a
workaround, use the str() and ACL(text=...) methods to pass around
textual representations.

Interface
---------

At module level there are now a few constants exported for easy-checking
at runtime what features have been compiled in:

- HAS_ACL_FROM_MODE, denoting whether the ACL constructor supports the
  mode=0xxx parameter

- HAS_ACL_CHECK, denoting whether ACL instances support the check()
  method

- HAS_ACL_ENTRY, denoting whether ACL manipulation is possible and the
  Entry and Permset classes are available

- HAS_EXTENEDED_CHECK, denoting whether the acl_extended function is
  supported

- HAS_EQUIV_MODE, denoting whether ACL instances support the
  equiv_mode() method

Internals
---------

Many functions have now unittests, which is a good thing.


Version 0.3
===========

Linux support
-------------

Under Linux, implement more functions from libacl:

- add ACL(mode=...), implementing acl_from_mode
- add ACL().to_any_text, implementing acl_to_any_text
- add ACL comparison, using acl_cmp
- add ACL().check, which is a more descriptive function than validate
