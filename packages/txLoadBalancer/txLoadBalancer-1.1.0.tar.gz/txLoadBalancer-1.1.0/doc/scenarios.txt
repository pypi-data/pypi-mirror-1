Classic Load Balancing
----------------------

Scenario:
    * n Services to be balanced
    * 1 Manager service that distributes load across n services

Problems:
    * number of remote connections limited by the number of file descriptors a
      system can open


Hierarchical LoadBalancing
--------------------------

Scenario:
    * many nested Classic Load Balancing scenarios

Problems:
    * latency is increased with each level added


Peered Load Balancing
---------------------

Scenario:
    * n services to be balanced 
    * m services can be managers, where m is anywhere from 1 to n (with Classic
      Load Balancing being a special case of Peered Load Balancing)
    * the managers are pre-configured by humans
