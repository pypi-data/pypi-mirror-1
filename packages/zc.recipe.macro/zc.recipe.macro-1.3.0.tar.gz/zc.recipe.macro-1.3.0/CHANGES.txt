CHANGES
=======

1.3.0 (2009-07-22)
------------------

- The recipe option for result sections is now pulled from the following
  sources, in this order:

    1) recipe in the parameters section of the macro target
    2) result-recipe in the parameters section for the macro target
    3) result-recipe in the macro invocation
    4) recipe in the macro definition

- Correct a rest error, that prevent the package of being installed with
  docutils 0.4.

1.2.5 (2009-03-05)
------------------

- Removed version sections from the documentation.
- Improved test coverage.
- Put QUICKSTART.txt under test, using manuel.
- Macro invocations will grow a result-sections value that lists the sections
  they modified or created.
- README.txt is now mostly Manuellified.

1.2.4 (2008-07-18)
------------------

- Fixed a bug that made self-targetting invocations fail when the macro utilized
  default values and the option that read the default came out the Options
  iteration first, added a regression test.
- Changed the test setup so that buildouts are tested by calling methods rather
  than creating a subprocess.  This allows for the --coverage flage to work in
  bin/test, and makes debugging and mimmicking the test output significantly
  easier.
- Fixed addition of targets so that they will show up properly when one calls
  buildout.keys().
