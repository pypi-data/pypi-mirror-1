Description: Macro Quickstart
        ================
        
        zc.recipe.macro is a set of recipes allowing sections, or even parts, to be
        created dynamically from a macro section and a parameter section.  This enables
        the buildout to keep its data seperate from its output format.
        
        Basic Use
        ---------
        
        In the most basic use of a macro, a section invokes the macro on itself, and
        uses itself as the parameter provider.
        Buildout::
        
        [buildout]
        parts = hard-rocker
        
        [rock]
        question = Why do I rock $${:rocking-style}?
        
        [hard-rocker]
        recipe = zc.recipe.macro
        macro = rock
        rocking-style = so hard
        
        Result::
        
        [hard-rocker]
        recipe = zc.recipe.macro:empty
        result-sections = hard-rocker
        rocking-style = so hard
        question = Why do I rock so hard?
        
        The recipe gets changed to zc.recipe.macro:empty, which is a do nothing recipe,
        because the invoking secion must be a part in order to execute recipes, and
        buildout demands that parts have a recipe, so it couldn't be emptied.
        
        Default Values
        --------------
        
        It is possible to include default values for parameters in a macro.
        
        Buildout::
        
        [buildout]
        parts = hard-rocker
        
        [rock]
        question = Why do I rock $${:rocking-style}?
        rocking-style = so hard
        
        [hard-rocker]
        recipe = zc.recipe.macro
        macro = rock
        
        Result::
        
        [hard-rocker]
        recipe = zc.recipe.macro:empty
        result-sections = hard-rocker
        rocking-style = so hard
        question = Why do I rock so hard?
        
        Creating Parts
        --------------
        
        Of course, there wouldn't much point to this if one could only create sections
        with a dummy recipe.  This is where the result-recipe option comes in.
        
        Buildout::
        
        [buildout]
        parts = hard-rocker
        
        [rock]
        question = Why do I rock $${:rocking-style}?
        
        [hard-rocker]
        recipe = zc.recipe.macro
        result-recipe = zc.recipe.macro:test
        macro = rock
        rocking-style = so hard
        
        Result::
        
        [hard-rocker]
        recipe = zc.recipe.macro:test
        result-sections = hard-rocker
        question = Why do I rock so hard?
        rocking-style = so hard
        
        Targets
        -------
        
        Often, one wants to create multiple new sections.  This is possible with the
        targets option.  This is only useful, however, if one can provide multiple
        sources for parameters.  Fortunately, you can.  Each new section can optionally
        be followed by a colon and the name of a section to use for parameters.
        
        Buildout::
        
        [buildout]
        parts = rockers hard-rocker socks-rocker tired-rocker
        
        [rock]
        question = Why do I rock $${:rocking-style}?
        rocking-style = $${:rocking-style}
        
        [hard-rocker-parameters]
        rocking-style = so hard
        
        [socks-rocker-parameters]
        rocking-style = my socks
        
        [tired-rocker-parameters]
        rocking-style = all night
        
        [rockers]
        recipe = zc.recipe.macro
        result-recipe = zc.recipe.macro:empty
        macro = rock
        targets =
        hard-rocker:hard-rocker-parameters
        socks-rocker:socks-rocker-parameters
        tired-rocker:tired-rocker-parameters
        
        Result::
        
        [rockers]
        recipe = zc.recipe.macro:empty
        result-sections = hard-rocker socks-rocker tired-rocker
        
        [hard-rocker]
        recipe = zc.recipe.macro:empty
        rocking-style = so hard
        question = Why do I rock so hard?
        
        [socks-rocker]
        recipe = zc.recipe.macro:empty
        rocking-style = my socks
        question = Why do I rock my socks?
        
        [tired-rocker]
        recipe = zc.recipe.macro:empty
        rocking-style = all night
        question = Why do I rock all night?
        
        In the previous example we hardcoded the result parts after the invoker in
        ${buildout:parts}.  This is brittle, because someone might change the names of
        the targets or alphabetize the parts list. An invocation will have a list of
        the sections it modified in its result-sections variable, which is created when
        the macro is executed.
        
        Buildout::
        
        [buildout]
        parts = ${rockers:result-sections}
        
        [rock]
        question = Why do I rock $${:rocking-style}?
        rocking-style = $${:rocking-style}
        
        [hard-rocker-parameters]
        rocking-style = so hard
        
        [socks-rocker-parameters]
        rocking-style = my socks
        
        [tired-rocker-parameters]
        rocking-style = all night
        
        [rockers]
        recipe = zc.recipe.macro
        result-recipe = zc.recipe.macro:test
        macro = rock
        targets =
        hard-rocker:hard-rocker-parameters
        socks-rocker:socks-rocker-parameters
        tired-rocker:tired-rocker-parameters
        
        Result::
        
        [hard-rocker]
        question = Why do I rock so hard?
        recipe = zc.recipe.macro:test
        rocking-style = so hard
        
        [socks-rocker]
        question = Why do I rock my socks?
        recipe = zc.recipe.macro:test
        rocking-style = my socks
        
        [tired-rocker]
        question = Why do I rock all night?
        recipe = zc.recipe.macro:test
        rocking-style = all night
        
        
        Special Variables
        -----------------
        
        zc.recipe.macro uses __name__ to mean the name of the section the macro is
        being invoked upon.  This allows one to not know the name of particular
        section, but still use it in output.
        
        Buildout::
        
        [buildout]
        parts = rockers
        
        [rock]
        question = Why does $${:__name__} rock $${:rocking-style}?
        
        [hard-rocker-parameters]
        rocking-style = so hard
        
        [socks-rocker-parameters]
        rocking-style = my socks
        
        [tired-rocker-parameters]
        rocking-style = all night
        
        [rockers]
        recipe = zc.recipe.macro
        result-recipe = zc.recipe.macro:empty
        macro = rock
        targets =
        hard-rocker:hard-rocker-parameters
        socks-rocker:socks-rocker-parameters
        tired-rocker:tired-rocker-parameters
        
        Result::
        
        [rockers]
        recipe = zc.recipe.macro:empty
        result-sections = hard-rocker socks-rocker tired-rocker
        
        [hard-rocker]
        question = Why does hard-rocker rock so hard?
        recipe = zc.recipe.macro:empty

        CHANGES
        =======
        
        1.2.5 (unreleased)
        ------------------
        
        - Removed version sections from the documentation.
        - Improved test coverage.
        - Put QUICKSTART.txt under test, using manuel.
        - Macro invocations will grow a result-sections value that lists the sections
        they modified or created.
        - README.txt is now mostly Manuellified.
        
        1.2.4 (2008-07-18)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed a bug that made self-targetting invocations fail when the macro utilized
        default values and the option that read the default came out the Options
        iteration first, added a regression test.
        - Changed the test setup so that buildouts are tested by calling methods rather
        than creating a subprocess.  This allows for the --coverage flage to work in
        bin/test, and makes debugging and mimmicking the test output significantly
        easier.
        - Fixed addition of targets so that they will show up properly when one calls
        buildout.keys().
