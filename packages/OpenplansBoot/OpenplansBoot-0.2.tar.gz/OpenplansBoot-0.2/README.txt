 OpenplansBoot
===============

This is a "bootstrap" package that is used to generate new deployments
of the OpenPlans software stack, the web-based group collaboration
toolkit that powers `openplans.org <http://www.openplans.org/>`_ and
other websites.


Usage
=====

This package provides a 'new_openplans_site' command, which will
create a directory structure useful for managing an ongoing OpenPlans
deployment.  Included in the generated directory structure is a
'newbuild.sh' command, which will launch a lengthy build of the myriad
parts of the OpenPlans software.

For more detail, please see `Getting Started with OpenPlans
