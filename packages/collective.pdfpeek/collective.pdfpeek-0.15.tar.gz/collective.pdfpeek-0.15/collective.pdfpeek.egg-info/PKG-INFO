Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        A Plone product that generates image thumbnail previews of PDF files uploaded
        to Archetypes based content objects.
        
        This product, when installed in a Plone 3.x site, will automatically generate
        preview and thumbnail images of each page of uploaded PDF files and store
        them annotated onto the content object containing the pdf file.
        
        Requires GNU ghostscript, PyPDF and PIL!
        
        The image generation currently takes place on object modified events.
        I am working on an implementation with a clock server process.
        This way the user does not have to wait for the images to be generated.
