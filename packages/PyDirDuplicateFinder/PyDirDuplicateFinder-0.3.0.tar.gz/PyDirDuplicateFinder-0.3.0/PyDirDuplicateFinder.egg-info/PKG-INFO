Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This application help you cleaning your filesystem from duplicate files. The duplicate meaning here is:
        *two or more files have the same content but can have different names*.
        
        You can use it in this way::
        
        Usage: duplicatefinder.py [options] [directories]
        
        Analyse all files in one or more directories and manage duplicate files (the
        same file present with different names)
        
        Options:
        --version             show program's version number and exit
        -h, --help            show this help message and exit
        -a ACTION, --action=ACTION
        choose an action to do when a duplicate is found.
        Valid options are print,rename,move,ask; print is the
        default
        -r, --recursive       also check files in subdirectories recursively
        -p PREFIX, --prefix=PREFIX
        prefix used for renaming duplicated files when the
        'rename' action is chosen. Default is "DUPLICATED"
        -m PATH, --move-path=PATH
        the directory where duplicate will be moved when the
        'move' action is chosen
        -v, --verbose         more verbose output
        -q, --quiet           do not print any messages at all
        
        Filters:
        Use those options to limit and filter directories and files to check.
        Options belowe that rely on file or directory name support usage of
        jolly characters and can also be used multiple times
        
        -s MIN_SIZE, --min-size=MIN_SIZE
        indicate the min size in bytes of a file for being
        checked. Default is 128. Empty file are always ignored
        --include-dir=INCLUDE_DIR
        only check directories with this name
        --exclude-dir=EXCLUDE_DIR
        do not check directories with this name
        --include-file=INCLUDE_FILE
        limit the search inside file with that name
        --exclude-file=EXCLUDE_FILE
        ignore the search inside file with that name

        TODO
        ====
        
        * More tests coverage (maybe some tests can be merged togheter).
        * Controls recursion maximum depth.
        * Internationalization (at least italian).
        * A "move to trash" action (dependency on `trash-cli`__ can be a great idea).
        * Release this as a Debian/Ubuntu/Kubuntu package (I'll really love this).
        
        __ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/trash-cli/

        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.3.0
        -----
        
        * The runnable script name has been changed to **duplicatefinder.py**.
        * You can now pass multiple target directories as parameters.
        * Added a **--action=ask** option for choosing at every duplicate what action perform (interactive mode).
        * Added the **--include-dir** option for limit the search only to specific directories.
        * Added the **--exclude-dir** option for skipping the search from some directories.
        * Added the **--include-file** option for match only some files in the search.
        * Added the **--exclude-file** option for skipping files from the search, based on file name.
        * Using a wrong directory name was not handled, but was producing only abnormal termination.
        * More kindly handle of the *break* (CTRL+C) user's action.
        * Added the **--verbose** option to print some more message infos.
        * Added the **--quiet** option to output nothing at all.
        * Removed the *_same_file* function. Python already have a `filecmp`__ module (hoping this is faster)!
        * Added environment for automated tests, and tests too (use the *--action=tests*).
        * Some fixes to the command line help.
