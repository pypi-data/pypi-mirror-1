        --version             show program's version number and exit
        -h, --help            show this help message and exit
        -a ACTION, --action=ACTION
        Choose an action to do when a duplicate is found.
        Valid options are print,rename,move; print is the
        default.
        -r, --recursive       Also check files in subdirectories recursively.
        -p PREFIX, --prefix=PREFIX
        Prefix used for renaming duplicated files when the
