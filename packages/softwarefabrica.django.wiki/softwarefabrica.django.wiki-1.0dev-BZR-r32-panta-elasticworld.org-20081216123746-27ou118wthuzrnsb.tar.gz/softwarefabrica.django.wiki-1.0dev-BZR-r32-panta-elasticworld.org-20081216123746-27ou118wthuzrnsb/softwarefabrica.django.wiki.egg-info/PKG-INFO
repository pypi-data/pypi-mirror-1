        This is meant to be used as a component in developing full-fledged wiki
        applications, but it also provides a fully working stand-alone application.

        appreciated. See below on how you can contribute.
        
        If you want to actively collaborate and provide code, documentation, tests or
        bug fixes, please feel free to create a new Bazaar branch in Launchpad, and tell
        us about it! See the collaboration_ section for more information.
