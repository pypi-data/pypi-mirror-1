What is this?
=============

This is a flexible wiki application for the `Django`_ web framework.

This is meant to be used as a component in developing full-fledged wiki
applications, but it also provides a fully working stand-alone application. 

Your help and feedback is precious. Suggestions and contributions are very much
appreciated. See below on how you can contribute.

If you want to actively collaborate and provide code, documentation, tests or
bug fixes, please feel free to create a new Bazaar branch in Launchpad, and tell
us about it! See the collaboration_ section for more information.
