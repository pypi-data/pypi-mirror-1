Forms
=====

Almost all the forms are automatically generated by the generic views (see the
`views documentation`_).

There are two additional, simple forms that are used by the ``v_wikipage_edit``
view: ``PageForm`` and ``PageContentForm``. These are built using the extended
``ModelForm`` mechaninsm provided by `softwarefabrica.django.forms`_.

See also the `models documentation`_, `views documentation`_, and `templates
documentation`_.
