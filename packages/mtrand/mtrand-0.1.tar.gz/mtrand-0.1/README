mtrand
======

mtrand implements the Mersenne Twister PRNG for Numeric and Scipy. It is
intended to replace the RANLIB PRNG currently in Scipy. All of the probability
distributions implemented by the RANLIB-based module in Scipy are available in
mtrand with the exception of the multivariate normal (which ought to be done in
Python anyways).

mtrand has only been tested with
    Python 2.4.1
    Numeric 24.0b2
    Mac OS X 10.4

mtrand requires a recent Numeric, preferably 24.0b2. It does not work with
numarray or the new scipy.base (aka Numeric3). It could be easily ported to
numarray, but I won't be doing it. I will be porting it to scipy.base shortly as
it gets integrated into Scipy.

I would be interested in hearing reports from users.
