It seems that manually specifying an IP to update to will not work. The 
remote site will always use the IP it autodetects. I thinks this is 
being handled correctly here, so it must be the site's fault.

Another site's fault is that it won't accept updates for multiple hosts, 
so we are currently working around this, by doing several updates, each 
for a single host.

BTW, the docs do not even state how multiple hosts should be separated 
in the request, but the dyndns API wants "x,y,z". I have tried this, but 
it will not work with dnsomatic.

Maybe, all of the above points should be discussed with the API guy, who 
seems open to discussion.
