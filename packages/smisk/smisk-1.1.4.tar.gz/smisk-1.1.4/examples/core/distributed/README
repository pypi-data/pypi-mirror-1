This demo shows how to create and run distributed processes.

process.py
  This comprises the web application.
  You can run it without arguments like this:
  ./process.py
  Or give it a port and optionally a hostname to bind to:
  ./process.py 127.0.0.1:5000
  (This process is programmed to die after 4 requests in order to test
  fail-over and load balancing. You can disable this by editing the self-
  explaining instance variable called "die_after_num_requests" in
  process.py to have the value -1.)

lighttpd.conf
  After you have started one process on port 5000, this configuration will
  setup a FastCGI-connection between lighttpd and the process and serve
  requests just as it would with a "local" process.
  This is how it gets down:
  lighttpd -Df lighttpd.conf

spawn.py
  Spawns several processes at once.
  To spawn 4 processes which accepts local connections on port 5000 to 5004:
  ./spawn.py 5000 4 127.0.0.1
