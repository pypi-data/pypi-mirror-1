        Summary
        =======
        
        Smisk is a simple, high-performance and scalable web service framework
        written in C, but controlled by Python.
        
        It is designed to widen the common bottle necks in heavy-duty web services.
        
        More information at the `Smisk website <http://trac.hunch.se/smisk>`_
        
        
        Getting Started
        ===============
        
        * Install with ``easy_install smisk``.
        * Download from the `Smisk website <http://trac.hunch.se/smisk>`_
        * Download from the `Smisk PyPI page <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/smisk>`_
        
        
        Examples
        ========
        
        This is a minimal Smisk service::
        
        from smisk import Application
        class MyApp(Application):
        def service(self):
        self.response.headers = ['Content-Type: text/plain']
        self.response("Hello World!")
        
        MyApp().run()
        
        And here we have a WSGI compatible application::
        
        import smisk, sys
        from smisk.wsgi import Gateway
        def hello_app(env, start_response):
        start_response("200 OK", [('Content-Type', 'text/plain')])
        return ["Hello, World!"]
        
        Gateway(hello_app).run()
        
        More examples `available here... <http://trac.hunch.se/smisk/browser/examples>`_

        * Full WSGI support – passes the wsgiref validation tests
        * Iterable request makes reading input data simple
        * Stream implements writelines for optimized sending of chunks of strings.
        * Response implements a Stream.writelines proxy, automatically calling begin()
        * Callable response makes responses simpler. Based on writelines
