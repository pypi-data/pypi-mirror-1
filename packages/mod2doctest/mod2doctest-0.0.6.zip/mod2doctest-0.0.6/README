mod2doctest
===========

mod2doctest is a module that converts a python module to a :mod:`doctest` 
compatible docstring.  

It's kind of like taking a python script, pasting it into an interactive
interpreter and then copying the output back into a docstring.  

But mod2doctest does it for you and also has many conveinance to make this 
process easier like adding ellipse markers for memory id / traceback and 
provides formating features.
