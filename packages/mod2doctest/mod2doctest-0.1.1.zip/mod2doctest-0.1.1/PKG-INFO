Description: mod2doctest
        ===========
        
        mod2doctest is a module that converts a python module to a doctest
        compatible docstring.
        
        It's kind of like taking a python script, pasting it into an interactive
        interpreter and then copying the output back into a docstring.
        
        With mod2doctest you can set up a test the "quick and dirty" way -- just by
        making a module that tests your code, running it, and then inspecting the
        output.  Then, you can use mod2doctest to take a snapshot of the output and
        convert it to a permanent test fixture.
        
        Also has many convenience to make this process easier like adding ellipse
        markers for memory id / trace back and provides several formating features.
