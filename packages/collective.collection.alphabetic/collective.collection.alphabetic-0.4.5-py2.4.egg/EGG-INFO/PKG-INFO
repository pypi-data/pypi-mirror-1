        Installation
        =============
        
        If you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
        recipe to manage your project, just do this:
        
        * Add ``collective.collection.alphabetic`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:
        
        |    [buildout]
        |    eggs =
        |        collective.collection.alphabetic
        
        * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug:
        
        |    [instance]
        |    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
        |    zcml =
        |        collective.collection.alphabetic
        
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with:
        
        |    $ ./bin/buildout
