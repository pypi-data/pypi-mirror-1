Installation
=============

If you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, just do this:

* Add ``collective.collection.alphabetic`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:

    |    [buildout]
    |    eggs =
    |        collective.collection.alphabetic

* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug:

    |    [instance]
    |    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    |    zcml =
    |        collective.collection.alphabetic

* Re-run buildout, e.g. with:

    |    $ ./bin/buildout
