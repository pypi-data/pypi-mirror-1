3.5.0 (unreleased)
------------------

- Performance related change to
  `zope.app.keyreference.persistent.KeyReferenceToPersistent.__cmp__`.

- Added support for new `ZODB.ConflictResolution.PersistentReference` behavior
  to persistent key references so that they can now, in many cases, allow
  conflict resolution when they are used as keys or set members in ZODB
  `BTrees` data structures.

3.4.0 (2007-10-24)
------------------

- Initial release independent of the main Zope tree.
