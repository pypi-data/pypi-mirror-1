3.6.1 (2010-03-07)
------------------

- Adapted tests for Python 2.4
- Added license file

3.6.0 (2009-01-39)
------------------

- Move all functionality to new ``zope.keyreference`` package. This
  package only provides backward-compatibility imports now.

3.5.0b2 (unknown)
-----------------

- Performance related change to the conflict resolution code in
  ``zope.app.keyreference.persistent.KeyReferenceToPersistent.__cmp__``.

- Added support for new `ZODB.ConflictResolution.PersistentReference` behavior
  to persistent key references so that they can now, in many cases, allow
  conflict resolution when they are used as keys or set members in ZODB
  `BTrees` data structures.

- Move zope.testing to the "test" extra require, because it's only needed for testing.

3.4.0 (2007-10-24)
------------------

- Initial release independent of the main Zope tree.
