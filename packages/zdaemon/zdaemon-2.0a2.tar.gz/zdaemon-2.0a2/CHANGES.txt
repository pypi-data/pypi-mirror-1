zdaemon Changelog
*****************

zdaemon 2.0a2 (2007/01/08)
==========================

New Features
------------

- Added support for setting environment variables in the configuration
  file.  This is useful when zdaemon is used to run programs that need
  environment variables set (e.g. LD_LIBRARY_PATH).

- Added a command to rotate the transcript log.

zdaemon 2.0a1 (2006/12/21)
==========================

Bugs Fixed
----------

- In non-daemon mode, start hung, producing annoying dots
  when the program exited.

- The start command hung producing annoying dots if the deamon failed
  to start.

- foreground and start had different semantics because one used
  os.system and another used os.spawn

New Features
------------

- Documentation

- Command-line arguments can now be supplied to the start and
  foreground (fg) commands

- zdctl now invokes itself to run zdrun.  This means that it's
  no-longer necessary to generate a separate zdrun script.  This
  especially when the magic techniques to find and run zdrun using
  directory sniffing fail to set the path corrrectly.

- The daemon mode is now enabled by default.  To get non-deamon mode,
  you have to use a configuration file and set deamon to off
  there. The old -d option is kept for backward compatibility, but is
  a no-op.

zdaemon 1.4a1 (2005/11/21)
==========================

Fixed a bug in the distribution setup file.

zdaemon 1.4a1 (2005/11/05)
==========================

First semi-formal release.

After some unknown release(???)
===============================

 - Made 'zdaemon.zdoptions' not fail for --help when __main__.__doc__
   is None.

After zdaemon 1.1
=================

 - Updated test 'testRunIgnoresParentSignals':
  
  o Use 'mkdtemp' to create a temporary directory to hold the test socket
    rather than creating the test socket in the test directory.
    Hopefully this will be more robust.  Sometimes the test directory
    has a path so long that the test socket can't be created.
  
  o Changed management of 'donothing.sh'.  This script is now created by
    the test in the temporarary directory with the necessary
    permissions. This is to avoids possible mangling of permissions
    leading to spurious test failures.  It also avoids management of a
    file in the source tree, which is a bonus.

 - Rearranged source tree to conform to more usual zpkg-based layout:
   
   o Python package lives under 'src'.

   o Dependencies added to 'src' as 'svn:externals'.

   o Unit tests can now be run from a checkout.

 - Made umask-based test failures due to running as root emit a more
   forceful warning.

zdaemon 1.1 (2005/06/09)
========================

 - SVN tag:  svn://svn.zope.org/repos/main/zdaemon/tags/zdaemon-1.1

 - Tagged to make better 'svn:externals' linkage possible.
