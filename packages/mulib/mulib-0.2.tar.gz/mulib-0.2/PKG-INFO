Description: 
        Mulib is a REST web service framework built on top of
        eventlet.httpd. Httpd parses incoming HTTP request and generates
        the response; mulib takes care of locating the object which will
        handle the request (url traversal) and calling the appropriate
        callback method based on the method of the request. Code written
        using mulib looks like a series of subclasses of mu.Resource which
        override methods such as handle_get or handle_post, making it easy
        to implement web services.
        
        The stacked traversal code also knows how to traverse python
        objects like dicts and lists. Using that style, it is possible to
        easily interact with compositional data structures through the
        Web.
