Mulib is a rest web service framework built on top of
eventlet.httpd. Httpd parses the http request and generates the
response; mulib takes care of locating the object which will handle
the request (url traversal) and calling the appropriate callback
method based on the method of the request. Code written using mulib
looks like a series of subclasses of mu.Resource which override
methods such as handle_get or handle_post, making it easy to implement
web services.

The stacked traversal framework knows how to traverse python objects
like dicts and lists, so it is possible to access compositional data
structures through the Web.

The wiki at http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Mulib is likely to be a
more current source of information than this README.  Questions,
patches, and general discussion go to the eventlet/mulib mailing list:

== limitations ==

* Sorely lacking in documentation
* Not enough test coverage -- the goal is 100%, but we are not there yet.
* Does not fit well on toast with brie.

== getting started ==

% python
>>> from mulib import mu
>>> help(mu)

Also, look at the examples in the examples directory.

== requirements ===

Mulib runs on Python version 2.3 or greater, with the following dependenceis:
* [[eventlet]]
* [http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/simplejson simplejson]
