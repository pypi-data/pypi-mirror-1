Change Log
==========

pyopencv-2.0.wr1.0.0 pre-beta release
-------------------------------------

- The first release of PyOpenCV. Many fundamentals of OpenCV have been
ported to Python. However, there is still some functionality not fully
available. Lots of small issues need ironing out. Just tell me which
parts you want PyOpenCV to improve and I will take time to improve them.
