Description: PyOpenCV brings Willow Garage's Open Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV)
        verion 2.0 to Python. The package takes a completely new and different
        approach in wrapping [http://opencv.willowgarage.com OpenCV] from traditional
        swig-based and ctypes-based approaches. It is intended to be a successor of
        [http://code.google.com/p/ctypes-opencv/ ctypes-opencv] and to provide Python
        bindings for OpenCV 2.0. ctypes-based approaches like ctypes-opencv, while
        being very flexible at wrapping functions and structures, are weak at
        wrapping OpenCV's C++ interface. On the other hand, swig-based approaches
        flatten C++ classes and create countless memory management issues. In
        PyOpenCV, we use Boost.Python, a C++ library which enables seamless
        interoperability between C++ and Python. PyOpenCV will offer a better
        solution than both ctypes-based and swig-based wrappers:
        * Provide a Python interface similar to the new C++ interface of
        OpenCV 2.0, including features that are available in the existing C
        interface but not in the C++ interface,
        * Preserve C++ data structures and avoid memory management issues,
        * Run at a speed nearer to OpenCV's native speed than existing wrappers.
        
        In addition, we use [http://numpy.scipy.org NumPy] to provide fast indexing
        and slicing functionality to OpenCV's dense data types like Vec-like,
        Point-like, Scalar, Mat, and MatND, and to offer the user an option to work
        with their multi-dimensional arrays in NumPy. It is well-known that NumPy is
        one of the best packages (if not the best) for dealing with multi-dimensional
        arrays in Python. OpenCV 2.0 provides a new C++ generic programming approach
        for matrix manipulation (i.e. MatExpr). It is a good attempt in C++. However,
        in Python, a package like NumPy is without a doubt a better solution. By
        incorporating NumPy into PyOpenCV to replace OpenCV 2.0's MatExpr approach, we
        seek to bring OpenCV and NumPy closer together, and offer a package that
        inherits the best of both world: fast computer vision functionality (OpenCV)
        and fast multi-dimensional array computation (NumPy).
