Description: grokui.admin: A basic grok admin UI
        ***********************************
        
        The replacement for the former ``grok.admin`` package.
        
        The internal name of the admin UI is:
        Grok Application Interface Application or, for short GAIA.
        
        GAIA is itself a Grok application and a subproject to the core Grok
        development. Its main goal is making developing of Zope 3 and Grok
        applications a faster and smarter job with more fun for everybody.
        
        
        Login - what is my username/password?
        =====================================
        
        Before you can use the admin UI, you first must log in.
        
        The username and password of the manager principal (kind of super
        user) can be found in the file ``buildout.cfg`` in the root of your
        subversion checkout.
        
        In case you do not know, what 'subversion checkout' means, look for a
        file ``site.zcml`` in your installation.
        
        Users of ``grokproject``, might find this file in
        ``<installdir>/parts/app/site.zcml``.
        
        
        Using the admin-UI
        ==================
        
        After login you can visit some of the main management topics, as
        described below:
        
        On top of the admin-UI you can always find three links to the main
        management activities currently possible with GAIA:
        
        
        Applications
        ============
        
        * List of all instanciated applications
        
        * You can add new instances of Grok applications
        
        * You can rename instances of Grok applications
        
        * For each installed application you can directly call:
        
        - the object browser (telling you more about this concrete object)
        
        - the class browser (telling you more about the class of your app)
        
        * For each available application type you can directly call:
        
        - the class browser (telling you more about the class of your app)
        
        * You can delete your installed applications.
        
        
        Server
        ======
        
        * Start/Restart the server. Caution! This does not work, if the server
        was started in 'foreground mode' (with 'zopectl fg').
        
        * Pack the ZODB. This removes old data from the database, freeing up
        disk space. In a production environment, you might want to pack the
        ZODB automatically from `cron`. This can be done using a command
        like the following::
        
        curl -q -s -u admin:admin "http://localhost:8080/server?pack=1&days=1"
        
        which will remove old data older than one day. If you leave out the
        `days` parameter, all old data will be removed.
        
        * Get basic information about the running Zope system.
        
        * Enter a message to be displayed on top. You can, for example, leave
        a message here for your co-admins. To delete the message, just enter
        the empty string in the appropriate input box.
        
        
        Documentation
        =============
        
        * From here you get starting points to the more elaborated
        documentation features of Grok, namely:
        
        - The object browser:
        
        helps browsing the ZODB and other objects.
        
        - The class browser:
        
        gives documentation to classes, packages and other things, which
        are not instances.
        
        
        Bugs, Caveats and Ways to Get Help
        ==================================
        
        The Grok admin UI was developed basically during a Google Summer of
        Code project.
        
        It is still full of bugs.
