Description: basketweaver
        ============
        
        ``basketweaver`` is a tool for creating your own package index out of a directory full
        of eggs. You can then point to this index with e.g. ``zc.buildout`` or ``setuptools``
        and thus be independant of PyPI.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Here is a quick example on how to install and use it::
        
        easy_install basketweaver
        cd <a/directory/with/eggs/>
        makeindex *
        
        This will create an ``index`` folder with links to all eggs.
        
        You can then make point a webserver to this directory and use this link in your ``zc.buildout``
        configuration or ``easy_install`` command.
