TODO list for OpenKremlin. This contains important as well as hypothetical
ideas for future development.

Misc
----
* OpenKremlin website!

User interface
--------------
* Transparent splitfile joining (treat .kgb.001, .kgb.002 etc as single archive)
* "Stream" incomplete files as they are downloaded
* (?) Full Tkinter-based GUI

Crypto code
-----------
* Lack of support for the "old" RC4 variant
* NB! Cryptography keys/buffers are not locked in memory, nor wiped after use
* Does not yet handle SAFER-encrypted archives
* The NewDES cipher is extremely slow due to a pure-Python implementation
* Does not implement ASCII-armored (uuencoded) message decryption
