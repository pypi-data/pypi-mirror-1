parallel-pprocess (0.2.4-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Set buffer sizes to zero for the file object wrappers
    around sockets: this may prevent deadlock issues.

parallel-pprocess (0.2.3-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Added convenient message exchanges, offering methods
    handling common situations at the cost of having to
    define a subclass of Exchange.
  * Added a simple example of performing a parallel
    computation.
  * Improved the PyGmy raytracer example to use the newly
    added functionality.

parallel-pprocess (0.2.2-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Changed the status testing in the Exchange class,
    potentially fixing the premature closure of channels
    before all data was read.
  * Fixed the PyGmy raytracer example's process accounting
    by relying on the possibly more reliable Exchange
    behaviour, whilst also preventing erroneous creation of
    "out of bounds" processes.
  * Added a removed attribute on the Exchange to record
    which channels were removed in the last call to the
    ready method.

parallel-pprocess (0.2.1-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Updated copyright and licensing details (FSF address,
    additional works).

parallel-pprocess (0.2-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low
