About

**django_future** is a tool for scheduling jobs on given times.


-----
Usage
-----

First of all, you need to have **django_future** installed; for your
convenience, recent versions should be available from PyPI.

Use the ``django_future.schedule_job`` function to schedule new jobs:

    >>> from django_scheduledjobs import schedule_job
    >>> import datetime
    >>> schedule_job(datetime.datetime(2010, 10, 10),
    ...              'myproject.myapp.handlers.dosomething')

To run outstanding jobs, use the Django management command 'runscheduledjobs'.
