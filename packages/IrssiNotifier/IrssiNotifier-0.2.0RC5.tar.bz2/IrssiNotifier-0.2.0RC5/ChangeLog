Irssi Notification 0.2.0 (?/May/2007)
http://irssinotifier.ufsoft.org/svn/tags/0.2.0

05-11-2007: Pedro Algarvio <ufs@ufsoft.org>
	* Dropped the `irclib` dependency. We now use our own unicode aware
	version of irclib.
	* We now also handle change nick for users that change their nicks into
	one we have as friend.
	* The gobject timeout is now lower, meaning, the pop-up message will be
	faster, less time will pass from the time the user send the message and we
	get the notification, this still does not mean a higher cpu usage.
	* If we pass both --gui and --debug we won't fork another process, we keep
	the same and get the logging on the console.
	* We now also make use of irclib's helper functions, so, we stop doin' the
	split stuff to know the nicks.
