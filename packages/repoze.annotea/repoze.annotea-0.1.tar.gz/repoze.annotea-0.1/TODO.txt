repoze.annotea TODOs
====================

- [_] Add a paster template for an instance, including creation of a
      'bin/annotea' script for starting / stopping the server.

- [_] Make the 'export_annotations' script write out a directory tree,
      allowing a static server to "mirror" the annotations.  This will also
      allow exporting / preserving any inline XHTML body for the annotation
      (which is the only form annozilla uses).

- [_] Alternatively, inject the inline XHTML into the mega-document.

- [_] Write an import script which can consume one of these formats, to
      permit a full dump-reload cycle.

- [_] Add authentication, tying annotations to a specific user.

- [_] Add a "my annotations" view (GET + POST?) to enable slurping out
      and later uploading only annotations belonging to a given user.

- [_] Test with other clients (see
      http://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/Projects#clients ).
