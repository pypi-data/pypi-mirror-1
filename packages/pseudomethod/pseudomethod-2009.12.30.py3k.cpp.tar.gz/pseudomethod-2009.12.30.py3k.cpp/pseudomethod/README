DESCRIPTION: pseudomethod - dynamically call ordinary functions as bound methods

SUMMARY:
pseudomethod is a pure python module.
pseudomethod hacks python's ast tree, adding the following syntax sugars: '..' '...' '....'  
pseudomethod can 'subclass' restricted, uninheritable python types like types.CodeType (compiled python code object)
pseudomethod can 'flatten' ugly nested function calls by sequentially binding their return values
