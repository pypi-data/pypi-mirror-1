        Introduction
        ============
        
        The idea behind this is to enable in Plone the ability to open external link in different
        browser windows.
        
        The right way to do this is to look for the **rel="external"** attribute on link elements.
        
        As far as **Kupu** and **TinyMCE** don't support the **rel** attribute, here we also look for
        the **class="external-link"** attribute.
        
        Also anchor's *title* will be changed/completed runtime with a more accessible message that
        warn user that a new window will be opened.
