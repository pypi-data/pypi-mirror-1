# `django-cherry`

`django-cherry` is a Django application which makes it easy to run your Django
project under the [CherryPy WSGI server][cp-wsgi]. The main command is defined
using [django-boss][djboss], a simple but powerful framework for creating and
running Django management commands.

  [cp-wsgi]: http://www.cherrypy.org/browser/trunk/cherrypy/wsgiserver/__init__.py
  [djboss]: http://bitbucket.org/zacharyvoase/django-boss/


## Installation

The usual:

    easy_install django-cherry # OR
    pip install django-cherry

Then just add `'djcherry'` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` setting.

Youâ€™ll need to have [django-boss][djboss] installed, although that will be
automatically handled by setuptools.


## Usage

`django-cherry` is used primarily from the command-line:

    $ djboss cherry --help
    usage: djboss cherry [-h] [-i INTERFACE] [-p PORT] [-s SOCKET]
                         [-t MIN_THREADS] [-m MAX_THREADS] [-l LOGGER]
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -i INTERFACE, --interface INTERFACE
                            A TCP network interface to listen on (default:
