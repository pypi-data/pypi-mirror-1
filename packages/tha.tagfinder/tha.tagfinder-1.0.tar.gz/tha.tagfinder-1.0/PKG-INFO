Description: tha.tagfinder
        =============
        
        tha.tagfinder is a library for finding trunks and tags in an svn hierarchy.
        Including options for not descending into specific directories and so.
        
        
        More details in src/tha/tagfinder/USAGE.txt .
        
        
        Usage of tha.tagfinder
        ======================
        
        .. :doctest:
        
        The goal of tha.tagfinder is to traverse though an svn structure and return
        tags and trunks.
        
        Three imports are needed:
        
        >>> from tha.tagfinder import extracter
        >>> from tha.tagfinder import finder
        >>> from tha.tagfinder import lister
        
        You need a startpoint, which is either an svn url or a directory name.  Our
        test fixture provides an svn repository:
        
        >>> repo_url
        'file://.../repo'
        
        Give your startpoint to a lister, in this case an SvnLister, with an optional
        list of directory names that should be ignored:
        
        >>> startpoint = lister.SvnLister(repo_url, ignore=['sandbox'])
        
        Choose an extractor.  Normally the BaseExtracter, but you can subclass it:
        
        >>> info_extracter = extracter.BaseExtracter
        
        Lastly, set up a finder with the startpoint and the extractor.  Optionally
        pass in stop_indicators that, when found in a directory, will stop the finder
        from recursing in that directory:
        
        >>> info = finder.Finder(startpoint, info_extracter,
        ...                      stop_indicators=[])
        
        The main usage is to query this info object for the projects it has found:
        
        >>> print(info.projects)
        [<tha.tagfinder.extracter.BaseExtracter object at ...,
        <tha.tagfinder.extracter.BaseExtracter object at ...]
        
        Every project object has attributes that are provided by the extracter.  So
        subclass the extracter if you need extra attributes of your own:
        
        >>> project = info.projects[1]
        >>> project.name
        'project1'
        >>> project.location
        'file://.../repo/project1'
        >>> project.tags
        ['0.1', '0.2', '0.3-bugfix']
        >>> project.tag_location('0.2')
        'file://.../repo/project1/tags/0.2'
