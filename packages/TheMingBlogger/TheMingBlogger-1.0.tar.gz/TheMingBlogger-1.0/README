Description
-----------

The TheMingBlogger generates blogs and their indices on the fly.  All
you need is Python 2.2 or greater in the cgi-bin and permalink data
files for the blog which are uploaded to the entries directory of each
blog. Example blogs are included.  The TheMingBlogger can be used
stand-alone with its own script or you can drop the blog server
directory into a Ming Server installation.

For an entry written at:

  Wed Jan  4 09:56:19 MST 2006

the permalink filename is

  20060104095619

The first line of this entry's file is:


		Title:Topic
such as:

		Frogs Rain From The Sky:The Usual

The rest of an entry is simply HTML.
