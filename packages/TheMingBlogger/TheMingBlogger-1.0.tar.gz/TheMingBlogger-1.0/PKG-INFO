Description: The TheMingBlogger generates blogs and their indices on the fly.  All
        you need is Python in the cgi-bin and permalink data files for the blog
        which are uploaded to the entries directory of each blog. Example blogs
        are included.  The TheMingBlogger can be used stand-alone with its own
        script or you can drop the blog server directory into a Ming Server
        installation and it will pull in the blogs automatically.
