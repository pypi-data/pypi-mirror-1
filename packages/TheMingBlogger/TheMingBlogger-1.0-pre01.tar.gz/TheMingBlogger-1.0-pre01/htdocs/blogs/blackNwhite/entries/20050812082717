dog chair:being

<p>The dog came from The Valley.  The chair came from Jackson Hole.

<p>The dog is half red heeler, half greyhound. The chair half
comfortable, half broken.

<p>The dog breathes.  The chair smells.

<p>Brindled: black and brown and white. Stained: sweat on green velour,
scratches on faux maple.

<p>Given away by poverty.  Given away by wealth.

<p>Unknowable.  Completely known.
