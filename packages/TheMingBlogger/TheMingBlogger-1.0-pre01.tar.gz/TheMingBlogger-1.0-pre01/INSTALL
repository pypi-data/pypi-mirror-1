Ming Blog Server Installation
=============================
billy-bob@billy-bob-ming.com

Note: You will need Python version 2.2 or greater!

The Easy Way
------------

Run the following command from a shell prompt:

	python setup.py install

A user-friendly script will guide you through the installation
procedure, prompting you to choose where you'd like to install
each package component.


The Hard Way
------------

If you don't feel like chatting with the interactive script, you
can just pass the right parameters to the 'install' command above.
The install script expects any of the following --install-x options:

      OPTION        |  DESTINATION PATH FOR:
--------------------|--------------------------------------------------
 --install-lib      |  'TheMingBlogger' Python package
 --install-scripts  |  'blogger.cgi' script (for stand-alone usage)
 --install-htdocs   |  example blogs (enter your web server's htdocs
                    |  directory path)

If you omit some of them, the relative components will not be installed
(even if the same component was required by the interactive installer).

If you don't set ANY of them, or if you try to use any install
command other than 'install' (ie: 'install-lib'), the installation
script will fall back to interactive mode.


Setup
=====

If you are using the Blog Server as a stand-alone application,
make sure you installed 'blogger.cgi' to cgi-bin. Then, open
it with a text editor and replace the BLOGS_DIRECTORY variable with
your site's doc root directory path. Make sure that blogger.cgi is
world-executable.

If you are using it on top of The Ming Server, just add the
BLOGS_DIRECTORY variable to ming.cgi or to whatever your Ming Server's
executable file is.  The Ming Server will then handle your blogs
automatically.

If you've installed the Blog Server (stand-alone) and the example docs,
you should now have something like:

   cgi-bin
      blogger.cgi
      TheMingBlogger
         (blog modules)
   htdocs
	  examples.html
      blogs
        black
        blackNwhite
        simplestripe
