Description: Fluid is a set of procedures to study fluids, focused for
        ocean and atmosphere analysis.
        
        It's able to estimate/convert basic variables such as mixing ratio,
        saturation vapor pressure and air viscosity, and estimate heat fluxes
        between air-sea interface.
        
        Great structure modifications are expected in upcoming versions.
        
        Until version 1.0 I'll try to keep backward compatibility, but I
        can't guarantee.
        
        I started to develop this package while being funded by SAAC-IAI, CAPES and FAPESP.
