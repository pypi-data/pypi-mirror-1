Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Allows to export and import AT objects contents and hierarchy.
        
        It supports also other contents or objects via plugins (ZCA).
        This part  mainly targeted for a developper audiance, so see interfaces.py / adapters.py.
        
        
        Products.csvreplicata Installation
        ======================================
        
        To install Products.csvreplicata into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
        using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:
        
        * When you're reading this you have probably already run
        ``easy_install Products.csvreplicata``. Find out how to install setuptools
        (and EasyInstall) here:
        http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall
        
        * If you are using Zope 2.9 (not 2.10), get `pythonproducts`_ and install it
        via::
        
        python setup.py install --home /path/to/instance
        
        into your Zope instance.
        
        * Create a file called ``Products.csvreplicata-configure.zcml`` in the
        ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
        should only contain this::
        
        <include package="Products.csvreplicata" />
        
        .. _pythonproducts: http://plone.org/products/pythonproducts
        
        
        Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
        recipe to manage your project, you can do this:
        
        * Add ``Products.csvreplicata`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.
        
        ::
        
        [buildout]
        ...
        eggs =
        ...
        Products.csvreplicata
        
        * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug
        
        ::
        
        [instance]
        recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
        ...
        zcml =
        Products.csvreplicata
        
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with:
        
        $ ./bin/buildout
        
        You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
        from another package's configure.zcml file.
        
        
        Because its top level Python namespace package is called ``Products``, this
        package can also be installed in Zope 2 as an old style **Zope 2 Product**.
        
        For that, move (or symlink) the ``csvreplicata`` folder of this project
        (``Products.csvreplicata/Products/csvreplicata``) into the ``Products`` directory of
        the Zope instance it has to be installed for, and restart the server.
        
        You can also skip the ZCML slug if you install this package the **Zope 2
        Product** way.
