        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages Slimbox_ for `hurry.resource`_. It relies on
        hurry.jquery for the dependency.
        
        .. _Slimbox: http://www.digitalia.be/software/slimbox2
        .. _`hurry.resource`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hurry.resource
        
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        You can import Slimbox from ``hurry.slimbox`` and ``.need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page::
        
        from hurry.slimbox import slimbox
        
        .. in your page or widget rendering code, somewhere ..
        
        slimbox.need()
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``hurry.resource``,
        and making sure that the original resources are published to some URL.
        
        The package has already been integrated for Grok_ and Zope 3. If you depend
        on the `hurry.zoperesource`_ package in your ``setup.py``, the above example
        should work out of the box. Make sure to depend on the `hurry.zoperesource`_
        package in your ``setup.py``.
        
        .. _`hurry.zoperesource`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hurry.zoperesource
        
        .. _Grok: http://grok.zope.org
        
        Preparing hurry.slimbox before release
        ======================================
        
        This section is only relevant to release managers of ``hurry.slimbox``.
        
        When releasing ``hurry.slimbox``, an extra step should be taken. Follow the
        regular package `release instructions`_, but before egg generation (``python
        setup.py register sdist upload``) first execute ``bin/slimboxprepare``. This
        will download the Slimbox library and place it in the egg. (The version number
        is currently hardcoded in the hurry.slimbox.prepare module).
