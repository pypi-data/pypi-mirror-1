Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        A simple integration of CMFBibliographyAT with FacultyStaffDirectory
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Add ``fsd.bibliographyat`` to the ``eggs`` option and ``zcml`` slug
        option of your buildout.cfg.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        A ``BibliographyFolder`` can be added either within the FSDDirectory instance
        or individually for every ``FSDPerson`` object. On the person level you can
        select a new supplementary view 'Co-author publications' displaying all
        publications within the FSD instance where the firstname and fullname matches
        against the author list of a publication.
        
        The implementation covers the following usecases:
        
        - persons create their own bibliography folder on the person level and
        maintain their "primary" publications there
        
        - a global bibliography folder in the FSD root or within another Person
        object contains bibliography entries
        
        Three new bibliography views are available:
        
        - ``base_view`` - as it comes with CMFBibliography
        - ``Primary author view`` - shows all entries of a persons bibliography folder
        (basically identically with base_view)
        - ``Co-author view`` - list bibliography entries from other bibliography folders
        where the fullname of the current person matches one of the authors of
        any found entry
        - ``Primary+Co-author view`` combines primary and co-auther view
