Description: This project has been superseded by the ``AddOns`` package; as it turns out,
        the term "add-on" is a much better way to describe what the package does.
        This final release is just a stub that wraps the ``AddOns`` package to provide
        a backward-compatible API.
        
        Please use the `AddOns`_ package in future, by performing the following renames
        in your code::
        
        Old Name            New Name
        ---------------     ----------------
        peak.util.roles     peak.util.addons
        Role                AddOn
        ClassRole           ClassAddOn
        roledict_for        addons_for
        role_key            addon_key
        
        And of course, you should change your ``install_requires`` to depend on
        ``AddOns`` instead of ``ObjectRoles``.
