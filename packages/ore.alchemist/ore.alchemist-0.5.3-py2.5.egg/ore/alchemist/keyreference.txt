Alchemist KeyReferences
-----------------------

An adapter that adapts alchemist mapped objects to a zope
keyreference.

This allows for usage of intids for relationally persisted objects
which in conjunction with additional packages allows for using many
standard zope techniques and components with relationally stored
content.

Beaware that referencing relationally stored objects persistently
within the zodb has implications for applications. ie. for example
persistence the notion that another process is interacting directly
with the database in read/write fashion could delete a relationally
stored object would result in a previously stored keyreference to that
object returning None. Also changing the primary key structure of any
underlying table of objects with extant keyreferences will render
extant references.
