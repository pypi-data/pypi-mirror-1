 - batching, ordering support

 - generic container ui based on annotation values.

--

changeset - use migrate schema generator support

validated properties - automatically 

sa2zs.py - fk support, automatically convert to object references, depends on ordering and keeping
           track of mappers



- Relational Database Support

  everything sqlalchemy supports, with the additional restriction that
  mysql < 5 need not apply. we heavily rely on introspection features.

  need to check unicode settings against database.

- sa2zs.py

  fairly good individual column support, support for fk relationships
  non existent atm.

  conversion to object fields and many2many relations depending on
  property settings.

  relations are mapper based, we do translation based on table
  structures, we need to move to mapper based definitions.

  could do just do an overlay on top of 

  needs tests for binding, date fields
