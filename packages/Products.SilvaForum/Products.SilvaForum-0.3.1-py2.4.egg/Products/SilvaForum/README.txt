What is it?
-----------

SilvaForum is an extension for Silva 2.x that provides a classic
discussion forum environment. Site visitors to create topics (subjects
or questions) and add comments to existing topics. SilvaForum can be
integrated with OpenID authentication and a CAPTCHA to prevent
*spambots* from attempting to post.

Installating SilvaForum
-----------------------

See INSTALL.txt for installation instructions, plus how to activate
the Silva Forum stylesheet.

Using SilvaForum
----------------

Visit the SMI (Silva Management Interface) to create a 'Silva Forum'
object: this will serve as the root of the forum. The public views of
the Forum allow (registered) clients to add topics (subjects) to the
forum, and comments (messages) to the topics. The topics and comments
are accessible from the SMI for editing and moderation purposes.

Access
------

Forums can be either exposed to the public, with authentication on the
forms, or they can only be viewed by authorized users.

Probably the forum is already viewable by the public. If not, go to
the access tab of the forum in the SMI and from the 'public view
access restrictions' choose the setting 'Anonymous' and click 'set
restrictions'. This will allow the public to see and navigate the
forum, however if any form input is submitted the user will be
prompted for their login.

If the forum should only be viewed by authorized individuals, go to
the access tab in the SMI and from the 'public view access
restrictions', choose the setting 'Authorized', and click 'set
restrictions'. This only allows authorized users to access and view
the forum and users will be prompted for login when entering the
forum.

Logging out with Internet Explorer
----------------------------------

Users using Internet Explorer have to explicitly logout with an
unknown username and password, otherwise, IE will keep the current
user logged in.
