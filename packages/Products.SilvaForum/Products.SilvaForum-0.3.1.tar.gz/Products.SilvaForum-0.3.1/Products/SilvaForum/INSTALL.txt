=====================
Installing SilvaForum
=====================

Dependencies
------------

  * SilvaForum depends on Silva 2.0.1 or later, and thus requires a fully working
    Zope/Silva 2.x install

Installation instructions
-------------------------

Unpack the SilvaForum-<version>.tar.gz tarball into the Products directory in
which Silva is installed. Reboot Zope and visit http://<your host>/<silva
root>/manage_services in your browser. Click on service_extensions, find the
'SilvaForum' gray box and click the 'install' button.

IMPORTANT STYLING NOTES: 
------------------------

When the SilvaForum extension is installed there are CSS files and other
resources located in the service_resources folder of your Silva root in its
SilvaForum folder. You can find these in:

/[yourSilva]/service_resources/SilvaForum/forum.css

To enable this place a tal:block with a condition in the head_inject *within*
the tal:block that defines 'model', thus:

<tal:block define="model request/model|here">
  <!-- your conditions go here -->
</tal:block>:

This is the condition block for detecting SilvaForum pages:

<tal:comment replace="nothing"> _______ SilvaForum CSS _______ </tal:comment>
<tal:block condition="python:model.meta_type == 'Silva Forum' 
                      or model.meta_type == 'Silva Forum Topic'
                      or model.meta_type == 'Silva Forum Comment'">
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="all"
    tal:attributes="href python:context.get_root_url()+'/service_resources/SilvaForum/forum.css'" />
</tal:block>

Now when a user visits a Forum, the forum.css stylesheet should also be
referenced by your layout. Probably it will be the last stylesheet referenced
so it will 'win' in a conflict with other stylesheets.

Note that the files in service_resources are on the file system and should not
be edited because they won't survive upgrades. If you're not satisfied with the
forum.css you can change the path in the head_inject to reference your own
forum.css file somewhere else.

For information about usage of the product, and contact information, see
README.txt.
