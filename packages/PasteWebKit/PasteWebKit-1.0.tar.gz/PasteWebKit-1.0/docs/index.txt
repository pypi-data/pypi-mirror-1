About WebKit
------------

This is a reimplementation of the `Webware
<http://webwareforpython.org>`_ WebKit servlet API.  This
implementation uses `WSGI <http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0333.html>`_
internally very heavily, and builds upon the framework-neutral tools
and services in Paste.

It also changes the installation and configuration process
considerably, making this a more traditional Python package.

However, *applications* are meant to be portable to this system with
very little effort.  You may encounter a few
``NotImplementedExceptions`` for some methods that seemed obscure, but
API compatibility *is* a goal, and any problems can be `submitted as a
bug <http://pythonpaste.org/trac/newticket?component=webkit>`_.

Status
------

Paste WebKit reimplements a stable API.  Paste WebKit itself is very
stable.  This is primarily a bridge project for bringing old Webware
code into the WSGI environment.  No non-bugfix development on Paste
WebKit is planned.
