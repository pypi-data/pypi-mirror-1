Description: Twill script recorder
        * Functional testing of web projects, and thus regression testing as well.
        
        * Performance testing: by loading the web application and monitoring
        your servers it helps you to pinpoint bottlenecks, giving a detailed
        report of performance measurement.
        
        * Load testing tool to expose bugs that do not surface in cursory testing,
        like volume testing or longevity testing.
        
        * Stress testing tool to overwhelm the web application resources and test
        the application recoverability.
        
        * Writing web agents by scripting any web repetitive task, like checking if
        a site is alive.
