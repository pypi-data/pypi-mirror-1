        Released under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 2.0
        
        This is a generic content migration framework, which should help you write
        your own content migrations. It has no UI and no value on its own, but
        makes it easy to write certain type of content migrations.
        
        This extends the ATContentTypes migration framework to provide three useful
        extensions:
        
        o A CustomQueryWalker can be used to specify a more specific catalog query
        for a walker to use (e.g. which content to actually migrate). This can
        be used with any migrator.
        
        o A BaseInlineMigrator is similar to BaseMigrator, but does not migrate by
        copying the old object to a temporary location, creating a new object and
        applying migration methods. Instead, migration methods are applied in-place.
        This simplifies the code significantly, because attributes, local roles etc.
        does not need to be copied over.
        
        Note that whereas BaseMigrator works in terms of self.old and self.new as
        the objects being migrated, BaseInlineMigrator only has a single object,
        stored in self.obj. This can be used with any walker.
        
        o An extension of this class called FieldActionMigrator uses the
        action-based migration framework for Archetypes fields, found in field.py.
        Please refer to that file for full details, but briefly, you specify a list
        of attributes to migrate at the storage level, instructing the migrator
        whether to rename, transform, unset or change the storage for an attribute.
        
        Please see the docstrings in walker.py, migrator.py and field.py for full
        details. For examples, see tests/cmtc.py and tests/testATFieldMigration.py.
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.0 - 2008-09-17
        ----------------
        
        - Update documentation to fit the code.
        [pbugni]
        
        - Modify CatalogWalker to root the search at the portal passed in. This
        makes it possible to only migrate in parts of a site.
        [wichert]
        
        - Correct path handling, cleanup classifiers, make short description short.
        [wichert]
        
        - Use standard naming convention for the contentmigration package.
        [wichert]
        
        - Be more graceful with schema mismatches.
        [wichert]
        
        - Replaced deprecated transaction.commit(1) with
        transaction.savepoint(optimistic=True).

        1.0b4 - 2007-06-11
        ------------------
        
        - Add import for os so egg can be built.
        [derek_richardson]
        
        - Added missing `configure.zcml`.
        [witsch]
        
        - Reorganize contentmigration trunk for eggification. If you are using the
        trunk as a product, pin to the previous revision or change your external
        to use src/Products/contentmigration.
        [derek_richardson]
        
        - First eggified release.
