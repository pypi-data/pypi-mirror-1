        See "docs/tutorial" for Tutorial documentation.  THIS TUTORIAL IS A BIT DATED and may not include
        all the steps needed.  The 'sampleremember' code is the most up-to-date.

        HISTORIC ISSUE (only relates to code based on SampleRemember version 1.0)
        
        If you based your code on an earlier version of SampleRemember (v 1.0)
        you may have an incorrectly registered GenericSetup "Import Step" that
        is stuck in your site, which might be preventing other GenericSetup
        profiles from running.
        
        I posted a How-To on plone.org called "GenericSetup: Uninstalling
        Import Steps" (which also details doing this manually in Clouseau),
        but if you're anxious:
        
        NOTE: The bad step may be called "remember-useraddr" or
        "sampleremember-defaultmember" or it may be called
        "YourProductNameHere-default".  The correct one is
        "remember-useradder", so don't delete that one.
        
        Instructions for removing this step are to create an External Method
        that calls the following code::
        
        from Products.GenericSetup import profile_registry, EXTENSION
        from Products.CMFPlone.interfaces import IPloneSiteRoot
        from Products.CMFCore.utils import getToolByName
        
        setup = getToolByName(self, 'portal_setup')
        
        setup.setImportContext('profile-myproduct:default')
        
        ir = setup.getImportStepRegistry()
        #print ir.listSteps()  # for debugging and seeing what steps are available
        
        # delete the offending step
        try:
        del ir._registered['myproduct-badstep']
        except KeyError:
        pass
        # commit the changes to the zodb
        import transaction
        txn = transaction.get()
        txn.commit()
        
        Changelog
