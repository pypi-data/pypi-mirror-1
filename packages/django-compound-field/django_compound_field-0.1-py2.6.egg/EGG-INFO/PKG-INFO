Description: == django compound field ==
        
        This addon allows you to define compound fields, e.g.
        
        {{{
        class AddressField(CompoundField):
        phone = models.CharField(max_length=30)
        mobile = models.CharField(max_length=30)
        fax = models.CharField(max_length=30)
        email = models.EmailField()
        }}}
        
        compound fields have no representation in the database, they just contribute the fields one by one to their carrier model.
        
        == KNOWN BUGS ==
        
        * you cannot nest compound fields (because the metaclass collects only Fields, and a CompoundField is not a Field)
        
        * you cannot assign the whole compound field during keyword based creation.
        
        * the fields in the carrier model are added out-of-order at the end.
