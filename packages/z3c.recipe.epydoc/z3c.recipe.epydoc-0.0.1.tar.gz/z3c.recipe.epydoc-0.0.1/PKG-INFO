        ====================
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        This buildout recipe generates epydoc documentation for you project
        
        Usage Instructions
        ------------------
        
        Let's say you have a package called ezineserver. In the buildout.cfg file of your package, add a ``docs`` section
        that looks like this::
        
        [docs]
        recipe = z3c.recipe.epydoc
        eggs =
        z3c.recipe.epydoc
        ezineserver
        doc = ezineserver
        
        Be sure to include it in the parts, as in::
        
        [buildout]
        develop = .
        parts = docs
        
        Now you can rerun buildout.  The recipe will have created an
        executable script in the bin directory called ``docs``.
        
        This script will run the epydoc documentation generation tool on your
        source code.
        
        To generate documentation simply run ``docs`` script::
        
        $ ./bin/docs
        
        This generates all the documentation for you and placed it in the
        parts directory.  You can then open it up in firefox and take a look::
        
        $ firefox parts/docs/index.html
        
        And that's it!
