1.0
---

- widget now can return zope DateTime or python datetime
  [Jensens]

- widget now displays time input only if ``show_hm`` is set to ``True``
  (as does CalendarWidget)

- locale for parsing the date in bda.indellidatetime.converter is obtained
  from the site_property `default_language`
  (widged was simply using 'de' before)
  this might break your testcases since for a default plone site the english dateformat is
  expected. you need to set the default language in your testsuite's `setUp` method to fix this.
