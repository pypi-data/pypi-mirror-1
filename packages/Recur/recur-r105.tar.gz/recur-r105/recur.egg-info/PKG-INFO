Description: 
        The recur module provides iterators for datetime objects. Recurrence patterns can be provided in natural language strings like "every 3 days" or "Sept 14" (currently, only a English Locale is provided). For example, this code:
        d = recur.Recurrence(datetime.date(1999, 11, 28), "-5 each month")
        Will make "d" an iterator, producing datetime.date objects starting with datetime.date(1999, 12, 26), and then proceeding to the fifth-from-last date of each succeeding month.
        The recur module now includes a Worker class, which spawns new threads as needed to accomplish recurring tasks. Subclass it and override its "work" method. You can set its "paused" and "terminated" attributes to True/False as needed to manage a recurring task.
