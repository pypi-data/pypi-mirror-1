1.1.2 (2008-04-14)
------------------

- Bug: When a package path contained anywhere the word "test", it was ignored
  from the coverage report. The intended behavior, however, was to ignore
  files that relate to setting up tests.

- Bug: Sort the results of `os.listdir()` in `README.txt` to avoid
  non-deterministic failures.

- Bug: The logic for ignoring unit and functional test modules also used to
  ignore modules and packages called `testing`.

- Change "Unit test coverage" to "Test coverage" in the title -- it works
  perfectly fine for functional tests too.


1.1.1 (2008-01-31)
------------------

- Bug: When the package was released, the test which tests the availability of
  an SVN revision number failed. Made the test more reliable.


1.1.0 (2008-01-29)
------------------

- Feature: The ``main()`` coverage report function now accepts the arguments
  of the script as a function argument, making it easier to configure the
  script from buildout.

- Feature: When the report directory does not exist, the report generator
  creates it for you.

- Feature: Eat your own dog food by creating a buildout that can create
  coverage reports.

- Bug: Improved the test coverage to 100%.
