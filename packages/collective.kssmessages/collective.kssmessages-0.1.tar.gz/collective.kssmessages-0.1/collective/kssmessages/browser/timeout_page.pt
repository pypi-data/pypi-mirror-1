<h1>Timeout error</h1>

<p>
  The server took too long to complete the operations. Possible reasons 
  are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The server had to perform an intensive operation and could not complete 
    it in time. For example, if you enter a first name 
    and the server must search the entire phone book for matches then it 
    may take too long to respond.
  </li>
  <li>
    The server took too long to return data to your computer. For example, 
    if the server did manage to retrieve the matches in the example above 
    then the result may be so large that it takes too long to send it to 
    your computer.
  <li>
    A network error occurred while the operation was being processed. This 
    is not indicative of a server error. It usually indicates that communication 
    was disrupted between your computer and the server.
  </li> 
</ul>

<p>
There is a high probability that the operation did take place on the server, 
or, if it is an intensive operation, it may still be processing. In either 
case you may want to <a tal:attributes="href request/came_from"><b>reload</b></a> 
the page that you are currently on. If the operation was supposed to 
save data it may now be visible on the page.
