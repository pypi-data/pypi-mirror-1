Changelog for archetypes.kss

    (name of developer listed in brackets)

archetypes.kss - 1.2.5 Released 2008-01-03

    - Changed 'saveField' to not require 'value' explicitly
      but to take it from the request if missing.
      This was done to support the use of 
        saveField-kssSubmitForm: currentForm();
      which is needed for multi-valued form variables.
      [raphael]

archetypes.kss - 1.2-1 Released 2007-09-10

    - UID refactoring for fields (inline editing) support
      [mborch]

    - Make sure inline edit is not active in the versioning preview. 
      (fixes #6958). From now on, the kss_inline_editable
      variable can be defined to False in a template and this will
      cause the contained widgets to be not inline editable
      even though their condition would allow it.
