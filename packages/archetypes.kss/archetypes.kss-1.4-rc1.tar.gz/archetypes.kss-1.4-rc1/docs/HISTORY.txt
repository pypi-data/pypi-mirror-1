        saveField-kssSubmitForm: currentForm();
      which is needed for multi-valued form variables.

    - Make sure inline edit is not active in the versioning preview. 
      (fixes #6958). From now on, the kss_inline_editable

      cause the contained widgets to be not inline editable
      even though their condition would allow it.
