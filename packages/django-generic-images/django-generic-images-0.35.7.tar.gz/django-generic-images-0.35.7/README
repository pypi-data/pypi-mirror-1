django-generic-images is a generic images pluggable django app.
License: MIT.
Author: Mikhail Korobov

This app provides image model (useful managers, methods and fields)
that can be attached to any other Django model using generic relations.
It also provides admin multi-image uploader (based on
GearsUploader, http://bitbucket.org/kmike/gearsuploader/) with client-side
image resizing, animated progress bar and before-upload image previews.

Requirements: django 1.1 (or trunk).

django-composition (http://bitbucket.org/daevaorn/django-composition/) is
required if you want to use ImageCountField or UserImageCountField.

There is an image gallery app
(django-photo-albums, http://bitbucket.org/kmike/django-photo-albums)
based on django-generic-images.
