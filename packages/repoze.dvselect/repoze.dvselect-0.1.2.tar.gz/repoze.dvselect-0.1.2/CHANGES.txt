``repoze.dvselect`` Changelog
=============================

0.1.2 (2009-07-11)
------------------

- Docs: fleshed out the example, including an annotated ``URISpace``
  file and details on configuring the application via Python.

- Docs: remove spurious ``[filter:dvselect]`` section from the example
  Paste INI file:  the middleware no longer requires configuration.

- Docs: point the user to the PyPI package docs page for detailed
  documentation (makes a traversable link on the main PyPI page).


0.1.1 (2009-07-10)
------------------

- Fix bug in the middleware entry point, which still required the
  ``urispace`` argument, even though it didn't need it.


0.1 (2009-07-05)
----------------

- Initial release.

  The released version has a backward incompatibility with earlier SVN
  versions of the pacakge:  the middleware no longer holds / applies
  a private ``repoze.urispace`` parser to the request URI;  instead, it
  expects that the ``repoze.urispace`` middleware has already added
  assertions to the environment based on the URI.
