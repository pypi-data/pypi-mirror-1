``repoze.dvselect`` Changelog
=============================

0.1 (2009-07-05)
---------------

- Initial release.

  The released version has a backward incompatibility with earlier SVN
  versions of the pacakge:  the middleware no longer holds / applies
  a private ``repoze.urispace`` parser to the request URI;  instead, it
  expects that the ``repoze.urispace`` middleware has already added
  assertions to the environment based on the URI.
