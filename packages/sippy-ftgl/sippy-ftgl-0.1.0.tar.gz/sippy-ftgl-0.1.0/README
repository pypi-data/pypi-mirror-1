This is a Python binding for the FTGL library.  

It requires the following:
* FTGL v2.1.3~rc5 
* Freetype v2.3.9

Once installed (see INSTALL for instructions), your Python application can use FTGL as follows.

First, import the module:
        import FTGL

Usage is the same as the C++ API, with the following caveats:

* font.BBox method
  * Instead of font.BBox(...), one first creates a BBox
        bbox = FTGL.BBox()
  * now pass in the font and string value
        bbox.setValuesUsingFont(font, str)
