Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        CroppableImageField is a drop-in replacement for the Archetype field
        ImageField. Includes support for:
        
        * Generating cropped thumbnails so that a collection of images can
        have thumbnails with a common aspect ratio independent of their
        individual aspect ratios. CroppableImageField lets you indicate
        which part of the image to crop from. You can configure
        CroppableImageField to crop from the top, middle or bottom of an
        image.
        
        * Dynamic rescaling of the original image.
        
        (Other cropping or clipping products already exist. All have slightly
        varying features.)
