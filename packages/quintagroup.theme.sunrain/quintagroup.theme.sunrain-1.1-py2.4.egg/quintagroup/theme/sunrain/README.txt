  * Logo. Default logotype dimensions - 188px width and 78px height. In case your logo height is bigger than the default one - portal-header area will be extended according to your logo height.

If your logo is smaller than the default one - it will be placed in the middle of logotype area.

  * Additional view for static portlets. SunRain theme comes with two additional views for static text portlet. To use them - go to portlets management screen ('Manage portlets'), select 'Static Stylish portlet' from the list of available portlet types.
