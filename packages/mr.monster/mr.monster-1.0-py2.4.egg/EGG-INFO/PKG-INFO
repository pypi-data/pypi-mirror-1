Description: Mr Monster
        ==========
        
        **He's fearsome.**
        
        About
        -----
        
        Mr Monster is a WSGI middleware designed to make it easy to locally test
        pipelines that will eventually be served behind apache with a rewrite rule in
        place.
        
        The configuration is very simple, the easiest case being::
        
        [filter:monster]
        use = egg:mr.monster#rewrite
        autodetect = true
        
        which simply adds the correct VirtualHostBase/Root declarations.
        
        Options
        -------
        
        :autodetect:
        Pick a host and port from the inbound request
        
        :host:
        Set the canonical hostname to pass to Zope. If used you must provide a port.
        
        :port:
        Set the canonical port.  If used you must provide a host.
        
        :internalpath:
        A path in the form `/foo/site` that is the base of your application in Zope.
        
        :externalpath:
        A path in the form `/bar/baz` to filter from a request using _vh_bar syntax.
