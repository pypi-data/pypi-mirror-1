Description: **ConfigObj** is a simple but powerful config file reader and writer: an *ini
        file round tripper*. Its main feature is that it is very easy to use, with a
        straightforward programmer's interface and a simple syntax for config files.
        It has lots of other features though :
        
        * Nested sections (subsections), to any level
        * List values
        * Multiple line values
        * Full Unicode support
        * String interpolation (substitution)
        * Integrated with a powerful validation system
        
        - including automatic type checking/conversion
        - and allowing default values
        - repeated sections
        
        * All comments in the file are preserved
        * The order of keys/sections is preserved
        * Powerful ``unrepr`` mode for storing/retrieving Python data-types
        
        Release 4.7.0 improves performance adds features for validation and
        fixes some bugs.
