Welcome to sprained!

Sprained is an integration between the spread toolkit,
(http://spread.org), which provides an implementation of group
messaging based on virtual synchrony and twisted,
(http://twistedmatrix.com), which provides a single threaded
asynchronous programming structure.

Please note that sprained has nothing to do with spreadsheets nor does
it have anything to do with the other twisted project with the
unfortunate name of "spread", (which has nothing to do with either
spreadsheets nor virtual synchrony).
