Description: Welcome to sprained!
        
        Sprained is an integration between the spread toolkit,
        (http://spread.org), which provides an implementation of group
        messaging based on virtual synchrony and twisted,
        (http://twistedmatrix.com), which provides a single threaded
        asynchronous programming structure.
        
        Please note that sprained has nothing to do with spreadsheets nor does
        it have anything to do with the other twisted project with the
        unfortunate name of "spread", (which has nothing to do with either
        spreadsheets nor virtual synchrony).
