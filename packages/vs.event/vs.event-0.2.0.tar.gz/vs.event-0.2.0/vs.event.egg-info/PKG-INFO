        ========
        
        ``vs.event`` provides an extendes event functionality for Plone
        
        Features
        ========
        
        - recurring events (based on p4a.ploneevent)
        - a new calendar widget
        - real support for all-day events
        - working iCal/vCal export for all-day events
        - full integration with Plone4Artists calendar (must be installed seperately)
        - support for supplementary-events (one master event and several depending events)
        
        Supplementary events
        ====================
        
        There are case where some particular event in reality consists of several date.
        E.g. for conference  you need an event for the conference date itself. However
        you often have additional supplementary events like a deadline for a
        call-for-papers or a registration deadline. With ``vs.event`` you create an
        event for the conference itself and so-called ``supplementary events`` for the
        call-for-papers and the registration deadline. The supplementary dates are
        events themselves but linked with the primary event (using the Archetypes
        references). So with ``vs.event`` you will see all supplementary events for the
        main event or jump directly from a supplementary event to its main event.  This
        feature is optional and can be disabled through the ZMI in portal_calendar ->
        vs_event_supplementary_events.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Add ``vs.event`` to the ``eggs`` and ``zcml`` options of your buildout.cfg.
        Create a new Plone site using the ``vs.event`` profile or install ``vs.event``
        through the quick installer of Plone.
        
        Known bugs and limitations
        ==========================
        
        - the localization of the date picker widget support only 'en' and 'de'
        so far. The date picker widget will use/present the US date format for
        languages other than German.
        
        - tooltip showing title/time within the P4A calendar does display
        all-day events properly
