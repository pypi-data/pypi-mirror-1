collective.skinny
=================

An example implementation of a separate, public-facing skin as
discussed at:

Look at the package's ``configure.zcml`` file for instructions on how
to activate the public skin.

This package is meant as a template to be copied and modified.  Make
sure you replace all occurrences of ``collective`` and ``skinny`` when
you do so.  I plan to make this package a ZopeSkel template once it's
proven to be robust.
