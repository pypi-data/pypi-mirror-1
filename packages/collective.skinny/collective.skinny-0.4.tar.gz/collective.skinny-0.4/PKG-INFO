        Usage
        -----
        
        Look at the package's ``configure.zcml`` file for instructions on how
        to activate the public skin to actually see it.
        
        This package is both an example and a library.  The easiest way to
        start using it is to just copy the package and modify.
        
        The better way is to use it as a library and extend it with your own
        package.  When doing so, you'll probably want to start out by
        subclassing and overriding through ZCML the main view, which lives in
        ``main.Main``.  Look at the ``configure.zcml`` file for pointers.
        
        To get started, look at the ``templates/`` directory.  The ``main.pt``
        template is where everything is wired together.  You can render other
        templates in the same directory by saying ``view/render_spam``, which
        will render the ``spam.pt`` template.
        
        Writing views for content objects works similarly.  Look at
        ``templates/content/document.pt`` to see how this can work.  This
        template is found and used because it corresponds to the
        ``portal_type`` of the content object you're displaying.  Thus, you
        can make your own view for Smart Folders by putting a ``topic.pt``
        template into the same directory, to give an example.  If no content
        view is found, we'll try and display Plone's default view for you.
        
        All of Plone's views such as ``@@plone_context_state`` and friends are
        available as usual in templates.  In addition, there's a handy
        shortcut for looking up tools: Using ``view/portal_spam`` will return
        the ``portal_spam`` tool from your Plone site.  (Try
        ``view/portal_url`` for a working example ;-).
        
        Screenshot
        ----------
        
        The example in this package looks something like this:

        Feedback
        --------
        
        I'd like to make this package work as easy as possible for you.  Let

        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.4 - 2009-04-16
        ----------------
        
        - Don't leak Plone views like ``folder_listing`` anymore in the public
        skin.
        
        0.3 - 2009-01-26
        ----------------
        
        - No longer require ``python:`` statements for rendering parts; use
        ``view/render_$part``.
        
        - Make portal tools available through ``view/portal_url`` and the
        like.
        
        - Add a ``render_viewlet`` convenience function to ``base.py`` that
        allows the reuse of Plone's viewlets in the public skin.  Look at
        ``main.MyNavigation`` for a usage example.
        
        0.2 - 2009-01-22
        ----------------
        
        - Instead of displaying the login form when an Unauthorized error is
        raised, display a 404 page in the public skin.  This will make pages
        like ``/edit`` invisible.
        
        0.1 - 2009-01-22
        ----------------
