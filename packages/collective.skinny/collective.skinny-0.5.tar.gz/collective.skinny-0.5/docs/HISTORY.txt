Changelog
=========

0.5 - 2009-04-20
----------------

- Allow any non-HTML resources from Plone to be served.  The previous
  "no leak" fix turned out to be a bit too strict, e.g. it wouldn't
  allow images from content to be served in the public skin.

- Patch site_properties to return the empty list for
  ``typesUseViewActionInListings`` so that images and files don't get
  a ``/view`` at the end when looking at the public skin, and thus can
  be skinned with Skinny.  To make you own view for images, add a
  ``templates/content/image.pt``.

0.4 - 2009-04-16
----------------

- Don't leak Plone views like ``folder_listing`` anymore in the public
  skin.

0.3 - 2009-01-26
----------------

- No longer require ``python:`` statements for rendering parts; use
  ``view/render_$part``.

- Make portal tools available through ``view/portal_url`` and the
  like.

- Add a ``render_viewlet`` convenience function to ``base.py`` that
  allows the reuse of Plone's viewlets in the public skin.  Look at
  ``main.MyNavigation`` for a usage example.

0.2 - 2009-01-22
----------------

- Instead of displaying the login form when an Unauthorized error is
  raised, display a 404 page in the public skin.  This will make pages
  like ``/edit`` invisible.

0.1 - 2009-01-22
----------------

- Initial release
