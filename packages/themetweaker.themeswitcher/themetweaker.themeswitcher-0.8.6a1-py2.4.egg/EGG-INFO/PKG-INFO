        Requires sd.common: (not on pypi) svn co http://tracker.trollfot.org/svn/projects/sd.common/trunk/
        Requires z3c.unconfigure 1.0.1: (included from setup.py) http://pypi.python.org/pypi/z3c.unconfigure/1.0.1

        Installing ThemeSwitcher
        ============
        sd.common is currently only available from its subversion repository. The subversion location is http://tracker.trollfot.org/svn/projects/sd.common/trunk/ .
        
        Installing ThemeSwitcher in plone through quickinstaller is not all together necessary. At this point it only gives you an actions tab on your folders. Everything else is zcml declared.
        
        Using ThemeSwitcher
        ============
        With quickinstaller installation:
        ------------
        Each folder will have a 'ThemeSwitcher' tab that will bring up the switcher form. Here you will be able to choose from a list of installed themes that use browserlayer to register themselves. How do I know if the theme is registered as a browserlayer? Look to see if the theme contains a 'browserlayer.xml' file, if it does, chances are it is registered as a browserlayer.
        
        Without quickinstaller installation:
        ------------
        Same as with installation except, you will need to manually type the switcher form path. e.g. "http://localhost:8080/plonesite/folder1/switcherform", because the actions tabs have not been installed.

        To Do List (for developer)
        ============
        TODO (pumazi) 'localconf' Do we still need this functionality?
        TODO (pumazi) write tests for verifying local settings
        TODO (catherine-w, pumazi) write documentation
        TODO (esteel, pumazi) use gloworm to change viewlet ordering on the subfolder basis [requires that each subfolder have a viewletsettingsstorage (via localconf?)]
