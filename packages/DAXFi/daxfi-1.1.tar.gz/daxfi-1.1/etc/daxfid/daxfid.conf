# You can create a section with the level name in this file to modify
# some configurable variables; the plug-ins for this level are supposed
# to be in a directory named %runlevel%.d under %xmlrules_dir%.
# E.g., for the runlevel "default" the plug-ins must be stored in
# /etc/daxfid/xmlrules.d/default.d/ in files named Sxxname.py
