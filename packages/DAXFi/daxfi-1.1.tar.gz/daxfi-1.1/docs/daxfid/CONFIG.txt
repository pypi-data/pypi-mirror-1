  The /etc/daxfid/daxfid.conf file for the daxfid daemon

This is a configuration file with the style of a '.ini' Windows file.

There's a main section, called 'DEFAULT'; here you have to set, with
the 'daemon' variable, if you want daxfid to terminate after the first
run or if it must remain active in the background; the default is
to automatically select its behavior.
Set 'conf_dir' to the directory where daxfid can found runlevel
directory and the plug-ins to execute.

The most important variable to set in the 'DEFAULT' section
is 'runlevel': it's the name of the set of plug-ins to run.
You have to create a directory under 'conf_dir' (usually in /etc/daxfid/)
named as the runlevel name followed by '.d' (e.g.: for the runlevel
'foobar' you have to create /etc/daxfid/foobar.d/)
Inside this directory, any file matching the shell pattern "S*.py"
is considered a plug-in, and then "executed".

Another important variable is 'firewall'; it specifies the kind
of firewall you're using: set it to 'ipchains' if you have a Linux
kernel 2.2.*, set it to 'iptables' if you use the netfilter
firewall of kernels 2.4.*, use 'ipfwadm' if you have an old 2.0
kernel or 'ipfilter' for ipfilter on any operating system supporting it;
using 'auto' daxfid tries to autodetect your firewall.
I *strongly* recommend that you leave this option set to 'auto'.

You can create inside /etc/daxfid/daxfid.conf a section with the name
of the runlevel; the followings options can be present both in 'DEFAULT'
section and in the runlevel specific one.  The latter settings
take precedence.

The 'xmlrules_dir' option indicates where to find the set of rules
written as XML files.

Options 'remote_ip', 'local_ip' and 'interface' specifies the
IP of the remote net (a good value for this is '0/0'), the IP
of the local system (leave it 'auto' if in doubt) and the
interface we're working with (idem).


  The plug-in files

As written above, plug-ins file for a given configuration are stored
in a directory named /etc/daxfid/{runlevel}.d/.
They are executed in alphabetical order considering
only the files with name like "S*.py"; a good example is "S20tcp.py":
"20" is used only to order a set of plug-ins in a specific way.

In these file must be declared a Python function called 'run_this()'
that is executed by daxfid.

For infos on how to write these functions, read INTERNALS.txt.

Normally plug-in files are stored in /etc/daxfid/rules.d/ and in the
directories of the various runlevel there're only links to these rules.


  The XML files

The files in /etc/daxfid/xmlrules.d/ are XML representations of
a set of firewall rules, for more infos, see INTERNALS.txt.
