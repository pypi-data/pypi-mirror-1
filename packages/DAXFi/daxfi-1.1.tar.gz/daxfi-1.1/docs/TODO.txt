# DAXFi todo

  daxfi package
* pf support.
* ipfw support.
* ipmasqadm support.
* get_with_order() method for RuleData objects.
* ipfilter: rewrite the Rule class in a cleaner way.
* the DTD is currently ignored.
* cleaner way to import C modules.
* introduce sanity checks for XML rule definitions.
* what about the 'forward' chain?
* manage the 'return' target.
* write a dummy firewall.
* rules accounting?
* introduce support for QoS?
* extend the _create() method.
* should the 'limit' section be considered FATAL for non-iptables firewalls?
* better methods to manage attribute negations.
* force stricter checks where needed.
* write a 'make clean' target for C code.
* default values for log.priority and log.level.
* C code is quite ugly.
* Python code, too.

  daxfid script
* tcplisten.py/udplisten.py examples work only for Linux (see netstat code).
* GLOBAL_COUNTER is really ugly!  See 'sched' module?
* use signal handlers SIGUSR* for enable/disable verbose mode.
* cleanup the code.
* how to send commands to a running instance of daxfid?  Via a
  client/server system?


  misc
* check C and Python code with rats, lint and pychecker.
* use distutil module.
* create deb/rpm/tgz packages.
* extend UML docs.
* better testsuite.


###
# Bugs

* my English is horrible.
* your face, too.
* many others!


###
# Ideas for a better tomorrow

* is it possible to write a "shell" so that we can send commands
  to daxfid (in daemon mode)?  From the shell we can show status
  informations on the firewall and the system...
* the C modules can directly return a RuleData object, or at least
  a dictionary object; it's also possible to _execute_ the rules
  direcly through the C modules (a RuleData object, an action and
  an optional rule number should be supplied).
* an editor for XML rules?
