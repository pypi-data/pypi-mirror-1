The daxfidump command dumps the current set of running rules of
your firewall.
The resulting XMLs are written in files in the current directory;
these files are named "daxfiXML_XX.xml" (one file for every rule is
created).

If you specify the "-s" option the rules are dumped in a sigle
file, named "daxfiRules.xml".

daxfidump takes in account rules in user-defined chains and
chain policy.
