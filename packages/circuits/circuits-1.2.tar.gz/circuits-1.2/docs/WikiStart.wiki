== Overview ==
'''circuits''' is a '''Lightweight''', '''Event''' driven '''Framework'''
with a strong '''Component''' Architecture. circuits also includes
a lightweight web framework (''with some similar features to [http://www.cherrypy.org CherryPy]''). circuits also includes various I/O (''Input/Output') and Networking components useful for networking applications.

Components communicate with one another by propagating Events on Channels
throughout the System. Each Component has a set of Event Handlers that
can listen for or filter Events on one or more Channels. Components react to Events and in turn expose further Events into the System. Each Component
is capable of managing it's own Events as well as those of other Components.
Complex directed graph structures can be created with Component Registrations,
this gives a level of hierarchy and separation of concern.

circuits' has a clean architecture and has no external dependencies on any
other library. It's simplistic design is unmatchable and delivers a
powerful framework for building large, scalable, maintainable applications
and systems. circuits' comes with a host of library of standard components
that can be quickly used to build your application or system, whether it be
an IRC Bot, Desktop Application, Web Server, Web Application, Network Server,
Distributed Application or just a simple script! There is also a collection
of [wiki:recipes Community Recipes and Components].

=== Quick Examples ===

==== Hello World! ====
{{{
#!python
>>> from circuits import Event, Component
>>>
>>> class App(Component):
...   def hello(self):
...      print "Hello World!"
>>> app = App()
>>> app.start()
>>> app.push(Event(), "hello")
Hello World!
}}}

==== Hello Web! ====
{{{
#!python
from circuits.web import Server, Controller

class Root(Controller):

   def index(self):
      return "Hello World!"

(Server(8000) + Root()).run()
}}}

This will serve {{{Hello World!}}} on http://127.0.0.1:8000/
