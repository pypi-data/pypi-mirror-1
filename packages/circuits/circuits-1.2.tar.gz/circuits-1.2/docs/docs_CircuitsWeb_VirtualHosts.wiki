= How to do Virtual Hosting =

circuits.web has a built-in dispatcher for supporting Virtual Hosts.

Put simply this means you can develop an application
that can serve different parts of itself for different
virtual hosts. For example, say you have an application
mounted at '''/''' on http://domain.com/ you could map:
 * http://foo.domain.com/ -> /foo
 * http://bar.domain.com/ -> /bar

== Example ==

{{{
#!python
#!/usr/bin/env python

from circuits.web import Server, Controller
from circuits.web.dispatchers import VirtualHosts

class Root(Controller):

   def index(self):
      return "I am the main vhost"

class Foo(Controller):

   channel = "/foo"

   def index(self):
      return "I am foo."

class Bar(Controller):

   channel = "/bar"

   def index(self):
      return "I am bar."

domains = {
        "foo.localdomain:8000": "foo",
        "bar.localdomain:8000": "bar",
        }

(Server(8000) + VirtualHosts(domains) + Root() + Foo() + Bar()).run()
}}}
