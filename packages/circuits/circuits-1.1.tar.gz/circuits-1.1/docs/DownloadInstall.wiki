= Downloading and Installing Circuits =

[[TOC]]

Circuits can be installed in any number of ways; using setuptools'
{{{easy_install}}}, from source, or using a binary installer. It's
highly recommended that you try to install circuits using setuptools
or from source.

== Setuptools ==
To install Circuits using setuptools' {{{easy_install}}}
run the following command in your terminal/console:

{{{
#!sh
$ easy_install circuits
}}}

''Windows Users'': Run the above in your __Command Prompt__.

== Source ==
To install Circuits from source:

 1. Download Circuits from either:
  * [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/circuits/> Python Package Index]
  * [http://trac.softcircuit.com.au/circuits/downloads> Circuits Website]

 2. Extract archive and Install:
{{{
#!sh
$ tar zxvf circuits--xxx.tar.gz
$ python setup.py build install
}}}

''Windows Users'':
 * Use your favorite tool to extract the archive, eg: Winzip
 * Open your __Command Prompt__ to the extracted path.
 * Type: {{{python setup.py build install}}}

=== Specifying an alternative installation path ===
To specify an alternative installation path, use one of the following options:
 * {{{--prefix=<path>}}} to install to <path>
 * {{{--home=<home>}}} to install to home directory <home>

=== Installing in Development mode ===
To install circuits in development mode, use the {{{develop}}} command
instead of {{{install}}} This allows you to easily update/upgrade circuits
and not have to worry about re-installing.

== Prerequisites ==
 * Python 2.5 or greater (''Also works with Python 3.x``)

=== Setting up setuptools: ===
On Windows:
 download http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py and then run it from
 the command line.

On UNIX:
 If you have curl or  wget installed you can do this with a single command:

{{{
#!/sh
$ curl http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py | sudo python
}}}

== Validate the installation: ==
To check your installation of circuits, type:

{{{
#!sh
$ python -c "import circuits"
}}}

If everything worked, nothing should be displayed.

Also try and run the [source:examples/hello.py Hello World!] example:

{{{
#!sh
cd examples
python hello.py
}}}

You should get the following output:

{{{
~/circuits/examples
$ python hello.py
Hello World
}}}
