        =================
        
        This is a app provides a view that handles redirection of feeds to the
        feedburner url. It is based on a stack overflow question:
        
        http://stackoverflow.com/questions/870979/redirect-django-feed-to-feedburner
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Rewrite your urls.py file that uses django's builtin feed view and replace it
        with ``django_feedburner.views.redirect_feed``.
        
        See this example ``urlpatterns``::
        
        urlpatterns = patterns('',
        (r'^feeds/(?P<url>.*)/$', 'django.contrib.syndication.views.feed', {'feed_dict': feeds}),
        )
        
        To use the redirections write::
        
        urlpatterns = patterns('',
        (r'^feeds/(?P<url>.*)/$', 'django_feedburner.views.redirected_feed', {'feed_dict': feeds}),
        )
        
        
        Know you must specify which feeds should get redirected. You can specify this
        with the ``FEEDBURNER_URLS`` setting. This must be a ``dict`` which holds the
        complete urls as keys that should get redirect. The values must be either an
        absolute url to the feedburner url or a path that starts with a slash. This
        values will be prefixed with ``http://feeds.feedburner.com``.
        
        To redirect the ``latest`` feed from the example above to feedburner's
        ``example-latest`` feed we must write::
        
        FEEDBURNER_URLS = {
        '/feeds/latest/': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/example-latest',
        }
        
        or a bit shorter::
        
        FEEDBURNER_URLS = {
        '/feeds/latest/': '/example-latest',
        }
        
        
        You can change the prefixed url with the ``FEEDBURNER_URL_PREFIX`` setting.
