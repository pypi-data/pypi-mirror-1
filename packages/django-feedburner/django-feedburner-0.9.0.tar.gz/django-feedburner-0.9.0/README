feedburner url. It is based on a stack overflow question:

Installation
============

Rewrite your urls.py file that uses django's builtin feed view and replace it
with ``django_feedburner.views.redirect_feed``.

See this example ``urlpatterns``::

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        (r'^feeds/(?P<url>.*)/$', 'django.contrib.syndication.views.feed', {'feed_dict': feeds}),
    )

To use the redirections write::

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        (r'^feeds/(?P<url>.*)/$', 'django_feedburner.views.redirected_feed', {'feed_dict': feeds}),
    )


Know you must specify which feeds should get redirected. You can specify this
with the ``FEEDBURNER_URLS`` setting. This must be a ``dict`` which holds the
complete urls as keys that should get redirect. The values must be either an
absolute url to the feedburner url or a path that starts with a slash. This
values will be prefixed with ``http://feeds.feedburner.com``.

To redirect the ``latest`` feed from the example above to feedburner's
``example-latest`` feed we must write::

    FEEDBURNER_URLS = {
        '/feeds/latest/': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/example-latest',
    }

or a bit shorter::

    FEEDBURNER_URLS = {
        '/feeds/latest/': '/example-latest',
    }


You can change the prefixed url with the ``FEEDBURNER_URL_PREFIX`` setting.
