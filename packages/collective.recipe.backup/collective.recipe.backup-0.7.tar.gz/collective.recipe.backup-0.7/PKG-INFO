Description: .. contents::
        
        ``bin/repozo`` is a zope script to make backups of your Data.fs. Looking up
        the settings can be a chore. And you have to pick a directory where to put the
        backups. This recipe provides **sensible defaults** for your common backup
        tasks. Making backups a piece of cake is important!
        
        - bin/backup makes a backup.
        
        - bin/restore restores the latest backup.
        
        - bin/snapshotbackup makes a full backup, separate from the regular
        backups. Handy for copying the current production database to your laptop or
        right before a big change in the site.

        Detailed Documentation
        **********************
        
        Example usage
        =============
        
        Just to isolate some test differences, we run an empty buildout once::
        
        >>> ignore = system(buildout)
        
        The simplest way to use it to add a part in ``buildout.cfg`` like this::
        
        >>> write('buildout.cfg',
        ... """
        ... [buildout]
        ... parts = backup
        ...
        ... [backup]
        ... recipe = collective.recipe.backup
        ... """)
        
        Running the buildout adds a backup, snapshotbackup and restore scripts to the
        ``bin/`` directory and, by default, it creates the ``var/backups`` and
        ``var/snapshotbackups`` dirs::
        
        >>> print system(buildout) # doctest:+ELLIPSIS
        Installing backup.
        backup: Created /sample-buildout/var/backups
        backup: Created /sample-buildout/var/snapshotbackups
        Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/backup'.
        Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/snapshotbackup'.
        Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/restore'.
        <BLANKLINE>
        >>> ls('var')
        d  backups
        d  snapshotbackups
        >>> ls('bin')
        -  backup
        -  buildout
        -  restore
        -  snapshotbackup
        
        
        Backup
        ------
        
        Calling ``bin/backup`` results in a normal repozo backup. We put in place a
        mock repozo script that prints the options it is passed (and make it
        executable). It is horridly unix-specific at the moment.
        
        >>> import sys
        >>> write('bin', 'repozo',
        ...       "#!%s\nimport sys\nprint ' '.join(sys.argv[1:])" % sys.executable)
        >>> #write('bin', 'repozo', "#!/bin/sh\necho $*")
        >>> dontcare = system('chmod u+x bin/repozo')
        
        By default, backups are done in ``var/backups``::
        
        >>> print system('bin/backup')
        --backup -f /sample-buildout/var/filestorage/Data.fs -r /sample-buildout/var/backups
        INFO: Backing up database file: ...
        
        You can also tell the backup to be more quiet with ``--quiet`` or
        ``-q``.  That is useful at least for cronjobs.  Warnings or errors are
        still shown.  In our case the mock repozo script still prints something::
        
        >>> print system('bin/backup --quiet')
        --backup -f /sample-buildout/var/filestorage/Data.fs -r /sample-buildout/var/backups
        
        
        Restore
        -------
        
        You can restore the very latest backup with ``bin/restore``::
        
        >>> print system('bin/restore')
        --recover -o /sample-buildout/var/filestorage/Data.fs -r /sample-buildout/var/backups
        INFO: Restoring...
        
        You can also restore the backup as of a certain date. Just pass a date
        argument. According to repozo: specify UTC (not local) time.  The format is
        ``yyyy-mm-dd[-hh[-mm[-ss]]]``.
        
        >>> print system('bin/restore 1972-12-25')
        --recover -o /sample-buildout/var/filestorage/Data.fs -r /sample-buildout/var/backups -D 1972-12-25
        INFO: Date restriction: restoring state at 1972-12-25.
        INFO: Restoring...
        
        
        Snapshots
        ---------
        
        For quickly grabbing the current state of a production database so you can
        download it to your development laptop, you want a full backup. But
        you shouldn't interfere with the regular backup regime. Likewise, a quick
        backup just before updating the production server is a good idea. For that,
        the ``bin/snapshotbackup`` is great. It places a full backup in, by default,
        ``var/snapshotbackups``.
        
        >>> print system('bin/snapshotbackup')
        --backup -f /sample-buildout/var/filestorage/Data.fs -r /sample-buildout/var/snapshotbackups -F
        INFO: Making snapshot backup:...
        
        
        Supported options
        =================
        
        The recipe supports the following options, none of which are needed by
        default. The most common one to change is ``location``, as that allows you to
        place your backups in some system-wide directory like
        ``/var/zopebackups/instancename/``.
        
        location
        Location where backups are stored. Defaults to ``var/backups`` inside the
        buildout directory.
        
        keep
        Number of full backups to keep. Defaults to ``2``, which means that the
        current and the previous full backup are kept. Older backups are removed,
        including their incremental backups. Set it to ``0`` to keep all backups.
        
        datafs
        In case the ``Data.fs`` isn't in the default ``var/filestorage/Data.fs``
        location, this option can overwrite it.
        
        full
        By default, incremental backups are made. If this option is set to 'true',
        bin/backup will always make a full backup.
        
        debug
        In rare cases when you want to know exactly what's going on, set debug to
        'true' to get debug level logging of the recipe itself. Repozo is also run
        with ``--verbose`` if this option is enabled.
        
        snapshotlocation
        Location where snapshot defaults are stored. Defaults to
        ``var/snapshotbackups`` inside the buildout directory.
        
        gzip
        Use repozo's zipping functionality. 'false' by default. Set it to 'true'
        and repozo will gzip its files. Note that ``*.fs`` becomes ``*.fsz``, not
        ``*.fs.gz``.
        
        additional_filestorages
        Advanced option, only needed when you have split for instance a
        ``catalog.fs`` out of the regular ``Data.fs``. Use it to specify the extra
        filestorages. (See explanation further on).
        
        
        We'll use all options::
        
        >>> write('buildout.cfg',
        ... """
        ... [buildout]
        ... parts = backup
        ...
        ... [backup]
        ... recipe = collective.recipe.backup
        ... location = ${buildout:directory}/myproject
        ... keep = 3
        ... datafs = subfolder/myproject.fs
        ... full = true
        ... debug = true
        ... snapshotlocation = snap/my
        ... gzip = true
        ... """)
        >>> print system(buildout) # doctest:+ELLIPSIS
        Uninstalling backup.
        Installing backup.
        backup: Created /sample-buildout/myproject
        backup: Created /sample-buildout/snap/my
        Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/backup'.
        Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/snapshotbackup'.
        Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/restore'.
        <BLANKLINE>
        
        Backups are now stored in the ``/myproject`` folder inside buildout and the
        Data.fs location is handled correctly despite not being an absolute path::
        
        >>> print system('bin/backup')
        --backup -f /sample-buildout/subfolder/myproject.fs -r /sample-buildout/myproject -F --verbose --gzip
        INFO: Backing up database file: ...
        
        The same is true for the snapshot backup.
        
        >>> print system('bin/snapshotbackup')
        --backup -f /sample-buildout/subfolder/myproject.fs -r /sample-buildout/snap/my -F --verbose --gzip
        INFO: Making snapshot backup:...
        
        Untested in this file, as it would create directories in your root or your
        home dir, are absolute links (starting with a '/') or directories in your home
        dir or relative (``../``) path. They do work, of course. Also ``~`` and
        ``$BACKUP``-style environment variables are expanded.
        
        
        Advanced usage: multiple Data.fs files
        ======================================
        
        Sometimes, a Data.fs is split into several files. Most common reason is to
        have a regular Data.fs and a catalog.fs which contains the
        portal_catalog. This is supported with the ``additional_filestorages``
        option::
        
        >>> write('buildout.cfg',
        ... """
        ... [buildout]
        ... parts = backup
        ...
        ... [backup]
        ... recipe = collective.recipe.backup
        ... additional_filestorages =
        ...     catalog
        ...     another
        ... """)
        
        The additional backups have to be stored separate from the ``Data.fs``
        backup. That's done by appending the file's name and creating extra backup
        directories named that way::
        
        >>> print system(buildout) # doctest:+ELLIPSIS
        Uninstalling backup.
        Installing backup.
        backup: Created /sample-buildout/var/backups_catalog
        backup: Created /sample-buildout/var/snapshotbackups_catalog
        backup: Created /sample-buildout/var/backups_another
        backup: Created /sample-buildout/var/snapshotbackups_another
        Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/backup'.
        Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/snapshotbackup'.
        Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/restore'.
        <BLANKLINE>
        >>> ls('var')
        d  backups
        d  backups_another
        d  backups_catalog
        d  snapshotbackups
        d  snapshotbackups_another
        d  snapshotbackups_catalog
        
        The various backups are done one after the other. They cannot be done at the
        same time with repozo::
        
        >>> print system('bin/backup')
        --backup -f /sample-buildout/var/filestorage/Data.fs -r /sample-buildout/var/backups
        --backup -f /sample-buildout/var/filestorage/catalog.fs -r /sample-buildout/var/backups_catalog
        --backup -f /sample-buildout/var/filestorage/another.fs -r /sample-buildout/var/backups_another
        INFO: Backing up database file: ...
        INFO: Backing up database file: ...
        INFO: Backing up database file: ...
        
        Same with snapshot backups::
        
        >>> print system('bin/snapshotbackup')
        --backup -f /sample-buildout/var/filestorage/Data.fs -r /sample-buildout/var/snapshotbackups -F
        --backup -f /sample-buildout/var/filestorage/catalog.fs -r /sample-buildout/var/snapshotbackups_catalog -F
        --backup -f /sample-buildout/var/filestorage/another.fs -r /sample-buildout/var/snapshotbackups_another -F
        INFO: Making snapshot backup: ...
        INFO: Making snapshot backup: ...
        INFO: Making snapshot backup: ...
        
        And a restore restores all three backups::
        
        >>> print system('bin/restore')
        --recover -o /sample-buildout/var/filestorage/Data.fs -r /sample-buildout/var/backups
        --recover -o /sample-buildout/var/filestorage/catalog.fs -r /sample-buildout/var/backups_catalog
        --recover -o /sample-buildout/var/filestorage/another.fs -r /sample-buildout/var/backups_another

        ************
        
        collective.recipe.backup is basically a port of ye olde instancemanager_'s
        backup functionality. That backup functionality was coded mostly by Reinout
        van Rees and Maurits van Rees, both from `Zest software`_
        
        Creating the buildout recipe was done by Reinout_ with some fixes by Maurits_.

        work. [reinout+maurits]
        
        - Added support for ~ in path names. And fixed a bug at the same time that
        would occur if you call the backup script from a different location than
