Description: Overview
        ========
        
        This package provides a module-level source-code generator which
        operates on the AST from the built-in ``compiler.ast`` module.
        
        Note that this AST is not compatible with the new ``ast`` module in
        Python 2.6.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        The generator works on AST parse trees.
        
        >>> from compiler import parse
        >>> tree = parse("""\
        ...     print 'Hello, world!'
        ... """)
        
        We can now generate Python-code equivalent to the original using the
        source-code generator.
        
        >>> from sourcecodegen import ModuleSourceCodeGenerator
        >>> generator = ModuleSourceCodeGenerator(tree)
        >>> print generator.getSourceCode()
        print 'Hello, world!'

        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.6.8 (released 18/05/2009)
        
        - Fixed issue where the delete operator would not be treated as a
        statement. [malthe]
        
        0.6.7 (released 22/04/2009)
        
        - Fixed issue where star and double-star arguments would be printed
        without the '*' and '**' prefix. [malthe]
        
        0.6.6 (released 17/04/2009)
        
        - Fixed issue where multiple discarded elements in a statement would
        get wrong indentation. [malthe]
        
        0.6.5 (released 19/02/2009)
        
        - Fixed issue where a module docstring would cause an undesired
        indentaion. [malthe]
        
        0.6.4 (released 24/01/2009)
        
        - Added convenience method to generate code. [malthe]
        
        0.6.3 (released 18/12/2008)
        
        - Allow proper operation under Python 2.4 (try/finally
        fixes). [chrism]
        
        0.6.2 (released 14/12/2008)
        
        - Fixed issue where lambda blocks would be incorrectly indented;
        also, function bodies are now always properly cleared. [malthe]
        
        0.6.1 (released 13/12/2008)
        
        - Fixed issue where generators would not be prioritized in certain
        cases. [malthe]
        
        0.6 (released 13/12/2008)
        
        - Operator precedence is now taken into account such that we can
        avoid unnecessary use of parentheses. This is done not only for
        aesthetic reasons, but more importantly to avoid running into
        parser errors due to Python's nesting limitation. [malthe]
        
        0.5 (released 28/11/2008)
        
        - Added `yield` and unary operators. [malthe]
        
        0.4 (released 28/11/2008)
        
        - Make sure all binary operators get parentheses around them; we may
        be able to improve upon this in the future (for
        legibility-reasons). [malthe]
        
        0.3 (released 27/11/2008)
        
        - Added logical operators. [malthe]
        
        - Fixed tuple unpacking issues. [malthe]
        
        - Added for-loop. [malthe]
        
        0.2 (released 27/11/2008)
        
        - Fixed issue with tuples and parentheses. [malthe]
        
        - Fixed issue with multiple assignments. [malthe]
        
        - Added support for `not` operator. [malthe]
        
        - Fixed issue where default arguments would be written incorrectly if
        no non-keyword arguments were present. [malthe]
        
        - Fixed issue where statements would not be cleared properly. [malthe]
        
        - Assignments are statements and should terminate. [malthe]
        
        0.1 (released 26/11/2008)
        
        - Initial release.
