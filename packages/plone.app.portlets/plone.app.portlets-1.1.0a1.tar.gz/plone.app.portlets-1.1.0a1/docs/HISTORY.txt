      http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7798.
      [optilude]

      http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7911.

      [fschulze]

    - PLIP203: Add the ability to export and import portlet assignments and
      blacklisting.
      [optilude]

    - PLIPs 205 and 218: Allow registering portlet types to multiple portlet

      GenericSetup, and restrict most default Plone portlet types to left/
      right/dashboard columns.
      [sirgarr]
    
    - PLIP207: Allow custom portlet managers, i.e., allow specifying an
      alternative portlet manager class through GenericSetup.
      [sirgarr]


plone.app.portlets 1.0.7 (UNRELEASED)

    - Make the language portlet handle languages without a native name
      correctly.
      [wichert]

    - Do not link to news_listing from the news portlet: that template has
      been removed from Plone. This fixes
      http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7872
      [wichert]


plone.app.portlets 1.0.6

    - Sort the languages in the language portlet using their native name.
      [wichert]

    - Fixed None value in query_string in calendar portlet. This closes
      http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7331.
      [hannosch]

    - Fixed logic error in getRootPath in the last change.
      [hannosch]

    - Only show the language portlet if more than one language is available.
      This brings it in sync with the language selection viewlet.
      [wichert]

    - Fix missing variable on the language portlet renderer. This fixes
      NuPlone which relies on the language selector portlet.
      [wichert]

    - Fixed undefined variable name introduced in the last change.
      [hannosch]

    - Correct getRootPath to not add a trailing / to paths if there
      are no context subelements. This was breaking webcouturier.dropdownmenu
      in situations where one of the sections was a navigation root.
      [wichert]

plone.app.portlets 1.0.5

    - Made absolute_url() work properly on the custom adding views. This is
      necessary for the <base /> URL to be set correctly.
      [optilude]

    - Handle RSS feed entries which do not have an update timestamp correctly.
      This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7515
      [wichert]

    - Provide proper 'id' implementations for assignment mappings and 
      assignments. This makes absolute_url() work properly.
      [optilude]

plone.app.portlets 1.0.2

    - Always try to refresh the RSS feed when rendering it instead of waiting
      for KSS to do trigger an updated. This is needed for the very common
      situation where most users are anonymous and the the feeds would expire
      (or never be loaded) and never (re)loaded.
      [wichert]
      
    - Add a language selection portlet.
      [wichert]

    - Fixed i18n markup bug in manage-content-type.pt.
      [hannosch]

    - Made prevMonth and nextMonth links in calendar portlet to work without
      KSS. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7052.
      [hannosch]

    - Make render_cachekey include the manager and assignment names, otherwise
      portlets that happen to have the same brains in their _data have the same
      cachekey.
      [ldr]

plone.app.portlets 1.0.1

    - Remove use of login javascript methods.
      [ree]

    - Change event portlet to use getIcon. This fixes
      http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5075.
      [limi]
    
plone.app.portlets 1.0

    - Add footer CSS classes to the search portlet. This fixes 
      http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6908.
      [wichert]

    - Verified translation of month names on the calendar portlet. Found a bit
      of missing i18n markup in the process. This closes
      http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6880.
      [hannosch]

    - Wrapped cached render results with a xhtml_compress method taken from
      plone.memoize. This allows you to plug in whitespace removal libraries.
      [hannosch]

    - Refactored calendar portlet and moved all calculations to the update
      method instead of doing it in its init.
      [hannosch]

    - Use relative links on the calendar portlet for the previous and next
      links, so the portlet can be cached independent of the context.
      [hannosch]

    - Cleaned up some templates, added missing i18n markup. This closes
      http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6721.
      [hannosch]

    - Fixed erroneous wording in add screen for classicportlet.
      Fixes https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6703
      [elvix]

    - Extended the portlet migration machinery to exclude the deprecated
      related and language portlets. This refs
      http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6545.
      [hannosch]

    - Cleaned and speeded up calendar portlet. Extinguished some unneeded
      uses of the DateTime module.
      [hannosch]

    - Fixed tests to deal with the new default start_level of the navigation
      portlet.
      [hannosch]

    - Made the workflow state to show configurable for the news and events
      portlets. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/1395.
      [hannosch]

    - Changed the default navigation tree configuration to start at level 1,
      thus there is no longer an overlap with the global navigation section at
      the top. If you want the old behavior back, configure the portlet to
      start at level 0.
      [limi]

    - Updated migration code to handle more converted portlets.
      [hannosch]

    - Do now show the login portlet if there is no login/password PAS
      extractor configured.
      [wichert]

    - Changed 'More news...' to 'More...' on RSS portlet as RSS feeds are not
      always news related. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6228.
      [sparcd]

    - Added <thead> tags to calendar portlet because the <tbody> tags were
      causing it to fail W3C validation.
      [sparcd]

    - Duplicate classes in login.pt were causing this to fail W3C HTML checks.
      Have merged the classes as this has a style="display:none" on it anyway.
      This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6241.
      [sparcd]

    - Replaced getToolByName with getUtility.
      [hannosch]

    - Moved class name from a to li tag for Cornelius (NuPlone skin).
      [jvloothuis]

    - Make URLs more ploneish, by removing .html at the end. .html really
      should be reserved for when people create content that way, e.g. if
      uploading from WebDAV. :)
      [optilude]

plone.app.portlets

    - Initial implementation.
      [optilude]

    - Initial package structure.
