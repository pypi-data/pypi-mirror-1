plone.app.portlets to-do
========================
  
  Decisions
  
    o May need a way to filter addable portlets by permission (e.g. some
        portlets are only available to some groups of users)
        
    o Category mappings are created on-the-fly in the namespace traversal
      adapters, which many not be ideal (even though these are protected by
      ManagePortal)
      
        - may be sufficient to create when the management views are invoked

    o ++dashboard++ probably only applicable to USER_CATEGORY
        - may want to imply more restrictions on category for different portlet
          manager types
        
  Portlets

    o Make standard set of portlets
        - Smart Folder renderer
        - Document renderer

  Plone Integration

    o Remove/deprecate portlets_fetcher
    
        - The need for a provider: expression will break existing customisations
          of main_template. May be better to put this expression in 
          portlet_fetcher.pt for now.
          
        - Consider what to do with 'sr', 'sl', 'hide_columns' and 
           'slots_mapping' in global_defines. Is anyone depending on these?
           
        - Need a way to signal that columns should be hidden
            - e.g. a property 'available' in the renderer?
          
  GenericSetup import/export handlers

    o Better test coverage for portlet manager GenericSetup import/export
        - export
        - re-import with purge
        - re-import without purge
      
    o Extend import/export handler to cover portlet assignments?
