        ======
        
        *pybctc* is a python package that makes access to British Columbia
        [Canada] Transmission Corporation (BCTC) electric data easier.
        
        The British Columbia [Canada] Transmission Corporation
        <http://www.bctc.com> is a crown corporation with a mandate to plan,
        build, and operate the province of British Columbia's electricity
        transmission system.  It publishes valuable information on electicity
        generation, transmission, and consumption to its website.  This
        information is useful for many purposes including economic analysis,
        power trading, electric system study, and forecasting.  The first step
        in using such information is to download it an parse it into useful data
        structures - a task performed by this library.  The processed data
        normally will feed statistical methods, heuristics, and system models to
        provide a useful analysis of the British Columbia electric system.
        
        The *pybctc* project is hosted at <http://bitbucket.org/kc/pybctc> and
        releases are made via the Python Package Index at
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pybctc>.  Online documentation is available
        at <http://packages.python.org/pybctc>.
        
        
        Requirements
        ============
        * *Python 2.4 or better* - Available at <http://python.org/download>
        (2009-11-25).
        
        * *pytz* - "World timezone definitions, modern and historical".
        Available at <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytz> (2009-11-14).
        
        * *xlrd* - "Library for developers to extract data from Microsoft Excel
        (tm) spreadsheet files".  Available at
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlrd/0.5.2> (2010-02-20).
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Extract the archive, enter the recovered directory and type:
        
        ``python setup.py install``
        
        Alternatively, the library can be installed via easy_install, or pip via
        the "pybctc" package name.
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Some code samples that use *pybctc* are availble in the ``examples``
        directory.  One sample is listed here::
        
        >>> '''List BCTC Control Area Load Points for 2010'''
        >>> # Standard library imports
        >>> import sys
        >>> from datetime import datetime
        >>>
        >>> # 3rd Party Libraries
        >>> import pytz
        >>> from bctc import BC_TZ
        >>> from bctc.load import yield_load_points
        >>>
        >>> start_dt = pytz.utc.localize(datetime(2010, 1, 1))
        >>> end_dt = pytz.utc.localize(datetime(2011, 1, 1))
        >>>
        >>> print '''2010 BCTC Control Area Load Points'''
        >>> print 'Date, Load'
        >>> for p in yield_load_points(start_dt, end_dt):
        >>>     # Time calculations are easier when done in UTC so that no timezone
        >>>     # conversions or daylist-savings time conversions need to be made.  For
        >>>     # this reason all times yielded by pyaeso are UTC.
        >>>     #
        >>>     # UTC times are converted to local times when they are displayed to the
        >>>     # user.
        >>>     print p.t.astimezone(BC_TZ), str(p.load) +'MW'
        >>>
        >>> return(0)
        
        
        Known Incompatibilities
        =======================
        
        * *Python <= 2.3* - Fails because of requirement for decimal module
        introduced in Python 2.4.
        
        * *Python 3* - *pybctc* uses two underlying libraries, pytz and xlrd,
        that have no Python 3 version available (2010-02-20).  When these
        underlying libraries support Python 3 the *pybctc* library can quickly
        be made to work.
        
        
        Bugs and Enhancements
