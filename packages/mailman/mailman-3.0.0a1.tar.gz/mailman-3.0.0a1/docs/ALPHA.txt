ALPHA RELEASE

    The Mailman 3 alpha releases are being provided to give developers and
    other interested people early looks at the next major version.  As such,
    many things may not work yet.  Your feedback and contributions are
    welcome.  At this time, please do not submit bug reports, but please
    provide your comments on the mailman-developers mailing list.


USING THE ALPHA

    Start by using setuptools to build the code.  Here's what I do, season to
    taste.  Python 2.5 is required.

    % mkdir staging
    % export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/staging
    % python2.5 setup.py develop -d staging

    Now you can run the test suite.

    % staging/bin/testall

    You should see no failures.

    At this point you can read the doctests by looking in all the 'doc'
    directories under the 'mailman' package.  Doctests are documentation
    first, so they should give you a pretty good idea how various components
    of Mailman 3 works.

    What, you actually want to /run/ Mailman 3?  Oh well, okay.  First you
    have to create a Mailman instance (as with all commands you can use --help
    to get a list of options).

    % staging/bin/make_instance -d var

    Look at mailman/Defaults.py and and mailman/configuration.py, and edit
    var/etc/mailman.cfg as necessary.  You will almost definitely want to add
    at least one add_domain() call.  You may also want to set LOG_CONFIG_FILE
    if you want to get more detailed logging, and USE_LMTP to turn on the LMTP
    server.

    You can use the create_list, remove_list, list_lists, add_members, and
    list_members to set up and populate some mailing lists.  You of coruse
    also need to use mailmanctl to start the queue runners, and then you can
    use the inject command to put some messages into the queue.   For the most
    part, they ought to get delivered <wink>

    Please note that the web u/i does /not/ work yet.
