The 'end' command
=================

The mail command processor recognized an 'end' command which tells it to stop
processing email messages.

    >>> command = config.commands['end']
    >>> command.name
    'end'
    >>> command.description
    u'Stop processing commands.'

The 'end' command takes no arguments.

    >>> command.argument_description
    ''

The command itself is fairly simple; it just stops command processing, and the
message isn't even looked at.

    >>> from mailman.app.lifecycle import create_list
    >>> mlist = create_list(u'test@example.com')
    >>> from mailman.Message import Message
    >>> print command.process(mlist, Message(), {}, (), None)
    ContinueProcessing.no

The 'stop' command is a synonym for 'end'.

    >>> command = config.commands['stop']
    >>> command.name
    'stop'
    >>> command.description
    u'Stop processing commands.'
    >>> command.argument_description
    ''
    >>> print command.process(mlist, Message(), {}, (), None)
    ContinueProcessing.no
