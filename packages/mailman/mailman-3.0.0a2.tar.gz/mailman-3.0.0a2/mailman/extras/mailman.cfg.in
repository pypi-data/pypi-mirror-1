"""This module contains your site-specific settings.

Use this to override the default settings in `Mailman/Defaults.py`.  You only
need to include those settings that you want to change, and unlike the old
`mm_cfg.py` file, you do /not/ need to `import Defaults`.  Its variables will
automatically be available in this module's namespace.

You should consult `Defaults.py` though for a complete listing of
configuration variables that you can change.

Mailman's installation procedure will never overwrite `mailman.cfg` unless you
tell it to.
