"""Local SMTP direct drop-off.

This module delivers messages via SMTP to a locally specified daemon.  This
should be compatible with any modern SMTP server.  It is expected that the MTA
handles all final delivery.  We have to play tricks so that the list object
isn't locked while delivery occurs synchronously.

Note: This file only handles single threaded delivery.  See SMTPThreaded.py
for a threaded implementation.
