# This address is the "site owner" address.  Certain messages which must be
# delivered to a human, but which can't be delivered to a list owner (e.g. a
# bounce from a list owner), will be sent to this address.  It should point to
# a human.
site_owner: changeme@example.com

# This address is used as the from address whenever a message comes from some
# entity to which there is no natural reply recipient.  Set this to a real
# human or to /dev/null.  It will be appended with the host name of the list
# involved.  This address must not bounce and it must not point to a Mailman
# process.

# When allowing only members to post to a mailing list, how is the sender of
# the message determined?  If this variable is set to Yes, then first the
# message's envelope sender is used, with a fallback to the sender if there is
# no envelope sender.  Set this variable to No to always use the sender.
#
# The envelope sender is set by the SMTP delivery and is thus less easily
# spoofed than the sender, which is typically just taken from the From: header
# and thus easily spoofed by the end-user.  However, sometimes the envelope
# sender isn't set correctly and this will manifest itself by postings being
# held for approval even if they appear to come from a list member.  If you
# are having this problem, set this variable to No, but understand that some
# spoofed messages may get through.

[logging.template]
# This defines various log settings.  The options available are:

# - level     -- Overrides the default level; this may be any of the
#                standard Python logging levels, case insensitive.
# - format    -- Overrides the default format string
# - datefmt   -- Overrides the default date format string
# - path      -- Overrides the default logger path.  This may be a relative
#                path name, in which case it is relative to Mailman's LOG_DIR,
#                or it may be an absolute path name.  You cannot change the
#                handler class that will be used.
# - propagate -- Boolean specifying whether to propagate log message from this
#                logger to the root "mailman" logger.  You cannot override
#                settings for the root logger.
#
# In this section, you can define defaults for all loggers, which will be
# prefixed by 'mailman.'.  Use subsections to override settings for specific
# loggers.  The names of the available loggers are:
#
# - archiver        --  All archiver output
# - bounce          --  All bounce processing logs go here
# - config          --  Configuration issues
# - debug           --  Only used for development
# - error           --  All exceptions go to this log
# - fromusenet      --  Information related to the Usenet to Mailman gateway
# - http            --  Internal wsgi-based web interface
# - locks           --  Lock state changes
# - mischief        --  Various types of hostile activity
# - post            --  Information about messages posted to mailing lists
# - qrunner         --  qrunner start/stops
# - smtp            --  Successful SMTP activity
