gXML is an XML toolkit abstraction for the different XML toolkits available in python. The goal of this abstraction is
to be able to work with XML regardless of which library is present on the system, while maintaing a very pythonic experience.

gXML currently supports:

elementtree
minidom

in that order of preference.

It supports just about every valid XML operation you might want to do.

There is currently no support for XPath.

The module currently needs a mechanism for setting user preferences of various toolkits.

Files:

	minidom.py - The minidom api
	test.py - Unit testing.
	test.xml - XML for unit testing. DON'T TOUCH!
