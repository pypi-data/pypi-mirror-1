Description: This library originated from a desire to do away with the large amount of
        boilerplater code required to bootstrap a Plone product. It provides
        installer, deinstaller and initaliser classes that provide reasonable default
        behaviour. It uses the old (Plone 2.x) way of installing old-fashioned
        Products but these are still surprisingly common in these days of egg-ified
        Plone add-ons (and sometimes easier to write). It won't fit all purposes but
        does make for quick-and-dirty bootstrapping of a Product.
        It also includes some other useful utility functions for Plone, mostly with
        a eye towards manipulating Plone from the debug prompt.
        There are numerous other Products or package that provide similar (and
        arguably better) functionality, including InstallUtils and PloneUtils.
