**Portal View** is a content type for displaying a portal like aggregating composite view.
It's a folderish object, which may contain only supported content types (created into column 
specific **Portal View Column Folders**).

**Portal View** has originally been developed for the public front page (and internal portal 
pages) of the `University of Jyvaskyla`__.
