        ``mekk.nozbe`` wraps (noticeable parts of) Nozbe_ API as Python
        functions.
        
        It uses both old, officially published API
        (http://www.nozbe.com/gtd/api) and new (not yet officially docunented)
        "Sync API". Neither of those APIs is fully covered (the module
        supports the functions which were working at early 2009 and which I
        needed), but still I succesfully use the library to extract projects,
        contexts and tasks from Nozbe and to create new (or update existing)
        items.
        
        The code is currently using Twisted network interface (that means
        returning deferreds etc). Well, I like Twisted. *I consider providing
        urllib-based synchronous API as an alternative, just need some
        motivation.*
        
        Apart from the library, nozbetool script is bundled. Run::
        
        nozbetool --help
        
        for details.
