        ===========
        
        ``mekk.nozbe`` wraps (noticeable parts of) Nozbe_ API as Python
        functions.
        
        It uses both old, officially published API
        (http://www.nozbe.com/gtd/api) and new (not yet officially docunented)
        "Sync API". Neither of those APIs is fully covered (the module
        supports the functions which were working at early 2009 and which I
        needed), but still I succesfully use the library to extract projects,
        contexts and tasks from Nozbe and to create new (or update existing)
        items.
        
        The code is currently using Twisted network interface (that means
        returning deferreds etc). Well, I like Twisted. *I consider providing
        urllib-based synchronous API as an alternative, just need some
        motivation.*

        Example
        ========
        
        Some simple example::
        
        from mekk.nozbe import NozbeApi
        from twisted.internet import reactor, defer
        
        # API KEY servers as an authentication token.
        # Check for your own at Nozbe extras page (http://www.nozbe.com/account/extras).
        # Note that publishing it is equivalent to publishing the password.
        API_KEY = "grab your own from Nozbe"
        
        # Data needed to run on Nozbe development server (contact Nozbe owner
        # to get the account there). Those are HTTP authentiation credentials.
        #
        # Not needed for run against production site
        DEVEL_MODE = { 'user': 'devel_username',
        'password' : 'devel_password' }
        
        @defer.inlineCallbacks
        def make_some_calls():
        nozbe_client = NozbeApi(API_KEY)  # run on production
        #nozbe_client = NozbeApi(API_KEY, DEVEL_MODE)
        
        print "* Some projects"
        projects = yield nozbe_client.get_projects()
        for project in projects[:3]:
        print project
        print
        
        print "* Some contexts"
        contexts = yield nozbe_client.get_contexts()
        for context in contexts[:3]:
        print context
        print
        
        print "* Some tasks"
        tasks = yield nozbe_client.get_tasks()
        for task in tasks[:3]:
        print task
        print
        
        print "Adding example task"
        nozbe_client.add_task(
        u"Example task made using script",
        project_hash = projects[0]['hash'],
        context_hash = contexts[0]['hash'],
        next = 1)
        
        yield nozbe_client.save_changes()
        
        @defer.inlineCallbacks
        def main():
        try:
        yield make_some_calls()
        finally:
        reactor.stop()
        
        reactor.callLater(0, main)
        reactor.run()
