Description: Cite: ''The IMS Vocabulary Definition Exchange (VDEX) specification defines a
        grammar  for the exchange of value lists of various classes: collections
        often denoted "vocabulary". Specifically, VDEX defines a grammar for the
        exchange of simple machine-readable lists of values, or terms, together with
        information that may aid a human being in understanding the meaning or
        applicability of the various terms. VDEX may be used to express valid data
        for use in instances of IEEE LOM, IMS Metadata, IMS Learner Information Package
        and ADL SCORM, etc, for example. In these cases, the terms are often not human
        language words or phrases but more abstract tokens. VDEX can also express
        strictly hierarchical schemes in a compact manner while allowing for more loose
        networks of relationship to be expressed if required.''
        (http://www.imsglobal.org/vdex/).
        
        This module takes the VDEX-XML objects and offers an API to them.
        
        VDEX Version 1 Final Specification is supported.
