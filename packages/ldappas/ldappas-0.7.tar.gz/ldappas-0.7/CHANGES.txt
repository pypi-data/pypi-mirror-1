ldappas changes
===============

0.7 - 04.07.2008
================

 * Updated install_requires to include all dependencies.
 
 * Removed deprecated localUtility ZCML.
 
 * buildout.cfg creates a python-ldap egg
 
   (this currently requires openldap install in /sw via Fink - building a
    python-ldap egg still requires manual assistance in most cases)

 * Compatible with Grok 0.12 and 0.13 releases.

0.6 - 20.11.2006
================

Features added
--------------

* Fixed Zope 3.3 induced deprecation warnings.

* principalInfo will try to look up a group if it cannot find a
  user. This is to make ldappas support groups in a minimal way. It is
  still the responsibility of the application to add LDAP-based groups
  to the principal (for instance by subscribing to the
  IAuthenticatedPrincipalCreated).


Bugs fixed
----------

Nothing yet.
