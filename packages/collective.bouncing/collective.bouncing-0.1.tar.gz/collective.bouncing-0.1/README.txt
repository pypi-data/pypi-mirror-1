Singing & Dancing.

User interface
--------------

A custom subscription portlet is included; each portlet instance is
associated to exactly one mailinglist.

A viewlet suitable for display below a document is also
provided. There's currently no configuration, although this could
easily be annotated.

The viewlet presents a form that gives an option to choose a
mailinglist (if more than one is available), and subscribe or
unsubscribe from the chosen list.
