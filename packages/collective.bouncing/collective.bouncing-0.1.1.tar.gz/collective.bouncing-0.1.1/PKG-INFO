Description: Overview
        --------
        
        This package brings third party mailinglist software integration to
        Singing & Dancing.
        
        See the README.txt inside the package for usage.
        
        
        Compatibility
        -------------
        
        Tested with S&D 0.5.
        
        
        Supported mailinglist software
        ------------------------------
        
        * Mailman
        
        
        User interface
        --------------
        
        A custom subscription portlet is included; each portlet instance is
        associated to exactly one mailinglist.
        
        A viewlet suitable for display below a document is also
        provided. There's currently no configuration, although this could
        easily be annotated.
        
        The viewlet presents a form that gives an option to choose a
        mailinglist (if more than one is available), and subscribe or
        unsubscribe from the chosen list.
