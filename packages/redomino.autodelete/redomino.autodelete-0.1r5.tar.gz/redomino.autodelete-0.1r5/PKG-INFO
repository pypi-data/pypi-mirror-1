        Overview
        --------
        
        Plone tool for autodeleting expired objects
        
        redomino.autodelete is a product for Plone.
        Once installed, you can set an expiration autodelete date for an object, and it will be automatically deleted after that date.
        Before that time, you can always change your mind and disable the option.
        Deletion is provided by an External Method added by default if PloneMaintenance is available.
        
        redomino.autodelete also provides a simple tool that allows the Manager to launch manually the delete task for expired objects.
        Otherwise the deletion could be launched manually using the AutoDelete Tool.
        
        redomino.autodelete has been developed with Zope/Plone 3 technologies.
