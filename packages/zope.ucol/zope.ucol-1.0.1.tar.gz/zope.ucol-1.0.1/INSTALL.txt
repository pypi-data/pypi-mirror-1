Installation
************

zope.ucol is installed via setup.py in the usual way.

You must have ICU installed.  If ICU isn't installed in the usual
places for include files and libraries on your system, you can provide
command-line options to setup.py when building the extensions, as in::

 python2.4 setup.py build_ext \
   -I/home/jim/p/z4i/jim-icu/var/opt/icu/include \
   -L/home/jim/p/z4i/jim-icu/var/opt/icu/lib \
   -R/home/jim/p/z4i/jim-icu/var/opt/icu/lib

 python2.4 setup.py install

Note that if the libraries are in an unusual place, you will want to
specify their location using the -R option so you don't have to
specify it at run-time.
