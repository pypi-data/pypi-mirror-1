Chimera depends on a somewhat significant body of software

Pango
Freetype 2
PyRex
PIL

Make sure all these are installed :)

SVG Support: 
librsvg-2.0
GdkPixbuf


ZOPE/Plone Install

First build the library 

$ python setup.py build

followed by 

$ python setup.py install

Install the pure python portion using setup.py install as above
copy the zope/ directory to your Products directory with 

$ cp -r zope <Products>/Chimera


Documentation:

$ python setup.py doc

will build the documents under the doc directory. The file api.pdf is
most interesting.
