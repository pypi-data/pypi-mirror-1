Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package provides a user interface to track time based on the concepts of
        gtimelog. When starting your working day you start a timer. Each time that you
        change to a different tasks you log an entry of what you were working on.
        
        In eXtreme Management we book our hours on tasks. This tracker allows you to
        select a number of tasks from the list of tasks that are assigned to you.
        The selected tasks are shown in the time tracker.
