Gracie is an `OpenID`_ provider which authenticates users against
local Unix system accounts.

It is useful for projecting an existing Unix authentication system to
OpenID consumers.

..  _OpenID: http://openid.net/

Requirements
------------

* Python >= 2.4

* python-openid

* python-pam
  (for systems using PAM for authentication)

* Routes

PAM configuration
-----------------

For systems authenticating using PAM, you will need to define a PAM
configuration for the service `gracie` (for example, in the file
`/etc/pam.d/gracie`). This should have the following PAM
configuration::

    auth    required    pam_unix.so
    account required    pam_access.so
