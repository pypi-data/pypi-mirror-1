A simple OpenID provider for local system accounts
==================================================

Gracie is an `OpenID`_ provider which authenticates users against
local Unix system accounts.

It is useful for projecting an existing Unix authentication system to
OpenID consumers.

..  _OpenID: http://openid.net/

Requirements
------------

* Python >= 2.4

* python-openid

* python-pam
  (for systems using PAM for authentication)

* Routes

PAM configuration
-----------------

For systems authenticating using PAM, you will need to define a PAM
configuration for the service `gracie` (for example, in the file
`/etc/pam.d/gracie`). This should have the following PAM
configuration::

    auth    required    pam_unix.so
    account required    pam_access.so

Installation
------------

Install the code library by using Python distutils::

    $ python ./setup.py install

Copy the `bin/gracied` program to a location on the superuser's
execution path (such as `/usr/bin/`), and ensure it is executable::

    $ chmod a+x ./bin/gracied
    $ sudo cp ./bin/gracied /usr/bin/.

Create a directory where Gracie can store its runtime data files::

    $ sudo mkdir /var/lib/gracie

Running `gracied`
-----------------

For invocation options, see the built-in help::

    $ /usr/bin/gracied --help

Note that the `gracied` daemon must run as the superuser to access the
PAM system::

    $ sudo /usr/bin/gracied --data-dir /var/lib/gracie --port 8000
