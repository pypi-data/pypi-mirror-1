Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package contains various visual components for Plone, such as viewlets
        and general views.
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.1.7 - December 15, 2008
        -------------------------
        
        - Modified user profile item on the dashboard to use an image tag
        instead of a background image. This makes it more consistent with
        the other list items and easier to style for RTL scripts.

        [spliter]
        
        - Fixed generation of links to author.cpt for user IDs that are a URL

        [davisagli]

        [encolpe]
        
        1.1.5 Released August 18th, 2008
        --------------------------------
        
        - Fixed an invalid message id for the dashboard. This closes

        [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed comments.pt to pass the title of the comment you are replying to into
        the discussion_reply_form. This closes
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8323
        [calvinhp]
        
        - Refactor default_page: move all logic out of the view to separate methods
        so they can be called without a request (which is not used at all).
        Deprecate parameters which were not in the interface and were never used.
        [wichert]
        
        - Added note that Javascript is required for presentation mode. This closes
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7575 and
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7573
        [limi]
        
        - Fixed plone_context_state's view_url method to work with contexts that don't
        have a portal_type.  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8028.
        [davisagli]
        
        - Changed IContentIcon to expose users to the title of the FTI instead of the
        portal_type. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8246.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Adjusted deprecation warnings to point to Plone 4.0 instead of Plone 3.5
        since we changed the version numbering again.
        [hannosch]
        
        1.1.3 Released July 7th, 2008
        ------------------------------
        
        - Made PersonalBarViewlet tolerate users who don't have a Plone user object, as
        when using OpenID or apachepas. This fixes
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7296.
        [erikrose]
        
        - Use 'index' attribute rather than 'render' for setting viewlet templates, so that
        they can be overridden using the 'template' ZCML attribute.
        [davisagli]
        
        1.1.0 Released April 20th, 2008
        -------------------------------
        
        - Applied patch from http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7942 to ensure that the
        'currentParent' marker is not True for items that have a path that is a
        substring of the true path.
        [optilude]
        
        - Displaying 'Anonymous User' also when the comment creator is an empty
        string. This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7712.
        [rsantos]
        
        - Allow the use of the icon attribute on action directly instead of using the
        actionicons tool.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Fix invalid leading space in all 'Up to Site Setup' links.
        [wichert]
        
        - Fixed permission in workflow history viewlet. This closes
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5507.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Made handling of self.context in portal.py consistent.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Rename the portal_url instance variable to site_url in the ViewletBase
        class. This prevents getToolByName(..., 'portal_url') from returning
        the URL string instead of the portal_url tool, which can causes unexpected
        and subtle breakage. portal_url is still available but produces a deprecation
        warning. It will be removed in Plone 4.
        [wichert]
        
        - Added viewlet for RSS link.
        [fschulze]
        
        - Added dependency on plone.app.viewletmanager.
        [fschulze]
        
        - Make viewlet managers in head section order- and filterable.
        [fschulze]
        
        1.0.6
        -----
        
        - Added i18n markup to nextprevious.pt.
        This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7537.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Catch KeyError for presentation or tableContents when document
        has an out-of-date schema.  Can happen when migrating from Plone
        2.5 to 3.0. Fall back to False for those attributes then.
        [maurits]
        
        
        1.0.5 Released January 3rd, 2008
        --------------------------------
        
        - Do not create an empty <ul> in the personal actions bar if there are
        no items in it. This fixes an XHTML syntax error.
        [wichert]
        
        
        1.0.4 Released December 6th, 2007
        ---------------------------------
        
        - Added i18n domain to comment.pt.
        [martior]
        
        - Allow non ascii characters in webstats_js code.
        Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7359
        [naro]
        
        - Fixed workflow history viewlet to handle entries with
        usernames that don't exist any more (deleted users) and
        also anonymous users.
        This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7250.
        [rsantos]
        
        
        1.0.3 Released November 9, 2007
        --------------------------------
        
        - Made getIcon urls relative to portal root.
        [tesdal]
        
        
        1.0.2 Released October 8th, 2007
        --------------------------------
        
        - Fixed getIcon code for use with ++resource++ and to use a safer method
        of getting the correct url.
        [optilude]
        
        - Upgraded the sitemap template to conform with the 0.9 specs from
        http://www.sitemaps.org and fixed the caching to use the filename.
        [deo]
        
        
        1.0.1
        -----
        
        - Lower logging level of 'no associated workflow' to avoid a log entry
        on each view.
        [ldr]
        
        - Fixed default language in globals.
        [wichert]
        
        - Fixed link to actor in history viewlet.
        [naro]
        
        - Avoid locking on non lockable types in byline viewlet.
        [jfroche]
        
        - Added website statistics inclusion viewlet to configure.zcml so it
        actually works.
        [fschulze]
        
        - Made code in defaultpage.py a bit more tolerant of missing tools.
        [hannosch]
        
        
        1.0 Released August 17th, 2007
        ------------------------------
        
        - Fixed the translation of the 'Show this page in presentation mode...'
        message.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Made the search box a bit wider, so the entire default text is shown
        in languages with a rather long term.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Show the authors full name in presentation view. This fixes
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6810
