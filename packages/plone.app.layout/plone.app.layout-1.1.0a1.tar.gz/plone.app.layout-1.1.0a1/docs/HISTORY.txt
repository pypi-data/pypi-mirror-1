Changelog
=========

1.1 UNRELEASED
--------------

- Rename the portal_url instance variable to site_url in the ViewletBase
  class. This prevents getToolByName(..., 'portal_url') from returning
  the URL string instead of the portal_url tool, which can causes unexpected
  and subtle breakage. portal_url is still available but produces a deprecation
  warning. It will be removed in Plone 4.
  [wichert]

- Added viewlet for RSS link.

- Added dependency on plone.app.viewletmanager.
  [fschulze]

- Make viewlet managers in head section order- and filterable.

- Catch KeyError for presentation or tableContents when document
  has an out-of-date schema.  Can happen when migrating from Plone
  2.5 to 3.0. Fall back to False for those attributes then.
