Version 1.1: 2 November 2005
    
    Change request default charset from 'iso-8859-1' to 'utf-8'.  In qp, html
    pages will use utf-8 encoding, so we will assume, in the absence of other 
    information, that requests use utf-8.  
    
    Allow for sessions when there is no https support.
    
    Remove Persistent from the __bases__ of Keyed and Keep so that they can
    be used as mixins with classes that already inherit from Persistent.


Version 1.0: 20 October 2005
    
    First release.
