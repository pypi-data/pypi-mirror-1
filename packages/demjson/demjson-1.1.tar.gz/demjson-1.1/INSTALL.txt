To install, type:

    python setup.py install

Optionally you can also just copy the "demjson.py" file into
your own project's directory.

This software is also published in the Python Cheeseshop.  So
you may be able to install it by using:

   easy_install demjson


Self tests are included which conform to the Python unittest
framework.  To run these tests, do

    cd test
    PYTHONPATH=.. python test_demjson.py
