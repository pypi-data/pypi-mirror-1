Version 1.1 released 2006-11-06
 * Extensive self testing code is now included, conforming to the
   standard Python unittest framework.  See the INSTALL.txt file for
   instructions.

 * Corrected character encoding sanity check which would erroneously
   complain if the input contained a newline or tab character within
   the first two characters.

 * The decode() and encode() top-level functions now allow additional
   keyword arguments to turn specific behaviors on or off that
   previously could only be done using the JSON class directly.  The
   keyword arguments look like 'allow_comments=True'.  Read the
   function docstrings for more information on this enhancement.

 * The decoding of supplementary Unicode character escape sequences
   (such as "\ud801\udc02") was broken on some versions of Python.
   These are now decoded explicitly without relying on Python so they
   always work.

 * Some Unicode encoding and decoding with UCS-4 or UTF-32 were not
   handled correctly.

 * Encoding of pseudo-string types from the UserString module are
   now correctly encoded as if real strings.

 * Improved simulation of nan, inf, and neginf classes used if the
   Python interpreter doesn't support IEEE 754 floating point math.

 * Updated the documentation to describe why this module does not
   permit multi-line string literals.
