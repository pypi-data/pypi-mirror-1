hurry.file changes
==================

1.1 (2008-08-07)
----------------

* Add in a buildout.cfg that installs the test runner.

* List dependencies in setup.py.

* Rely on zope.session instead of zope.app.session to stop deprecation
  warnings.

* Add long description in setup.py based on README.txt and file.txt
  doctests, and CHANGES.txt.

1.0 (2006-10-25)
----------------

* Support for Tramline (fast file uploads/downloads) through
  IFileRetrieval. By default, nothing changes.

  If a subclass of TramlineFileRetrievalBase is registered as a
  IFileRetrieval utility, hurry.file becomes Tramline aware. If files
  are created manually, they can be created through the
  createHurryFile function, or the 'createFile' method of the
  IFileRetrieval service. This will take care of storing the file in
  the right place.

  Tramline can be found here: http://codespeak.net/svn/rr/tramline/trunk

0.9.3 (2006-10-23)
------------------

* Send tramline_ok header back when redisplaying widget, in case we're
  working with tramline.

0.9.2 (2006-09-28)
------------------

* Zope 3.3 has a change in the way it deals with file name encoding
  which broke hurry.file. This includes a workaround.

0.9.1 (2006-09-22)
------------------

* first cheeseshop release.

0.9 (2006-06-15)
----------------

* separation from general hurry package into hurry.file

* eggification

0.8 (2006-05-01)
