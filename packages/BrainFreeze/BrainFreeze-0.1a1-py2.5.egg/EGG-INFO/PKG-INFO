        Introduction
        ------------
        
        BrainFreeze is an SQLAlchemy plugin that contains a set of tools for
        proxying attributes through one-to-one relations, kind of like
        SQLAlchemy's AssociationProxy, but for one-to-one relations.

        OneToOneProxy
        -------------
        
        BrainFreeze provides an SQLAlchemy Python Property that will take all the
        foreign columns in a one-to-one relation and make them accessible on the
        mapped class. Kind of like SQLAlchemy's AssociationProxy but for one-to-one
        relations.
        
        But wait! There's More! Also included is a SQLAlchemy MapperProperty that lets
        these foreign columns be query-able just as if they were normal columns on the
        mapped class.
        
        Act now and you'll receive as our special gift to you, an SQLAlchemy
        MapperExtension that sets this all up for you automatically.
