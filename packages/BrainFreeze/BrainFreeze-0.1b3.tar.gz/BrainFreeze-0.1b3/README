BrainFreeze SQLAlchemy Plugin
=============================

------------
Introduction
------------

BrainFreeze is an SQLAlchemy plugin that contains a set of tools for 
proxying attributes through one-to-one relations, kind of like 
SQLAlchemy's AssociationProxy, but for one-to-one relations.

Installation and Usage

OneToOneProxy
-------------

BrainFreeze provides an SQLAlchemy Python Property that will take all the
foreign columns in a one-to-one relation and make them accessible on the
mapped class. Kind of like SQLAlchemy's AssociationProxy but for one-to-one
relations.

But wait! There's More! Also included is a SQLAlchemy MapperProperty that lets
these foreign columns be query-able just as if they were normal columns on the
mapped class.

Act now and you'll receive as our special gift to you, an SQLAlchemy
MapperExtension that sets this all up for you automatically.
