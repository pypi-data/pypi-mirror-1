BrainFreeze SQLAlchemy Plugin
=============================

BrainFreeze 0.1rc1 - November 12, 2008
--------------------------------------
  * OneToOneProxy is now powered by Alchemy's own AssociationProxy, which will hopefully 
    mean EVEN more forward-compatability with future versions of Alchemy.

BrainFreeze 0.1b3 - November 10, 2008
-------------------------------------
  * OneToOneMapperProperty is now powered by Alchemy's own ComparableProperty,
    which will hopefully mean more forward-compatability with future versions of Alchemy.
  * In Alchemy, Mapper.__props was thankfully renamed to Mapper._props, so we don't have
    to do name-mangling anymore to get to the properties dictionary.
  * BIG NEWS! We now support proxying PropertyLoader (relation) objects in addition to 
    ColumnProperty objects.  You can query by them, and changes are persisted!  Docs have
    been updated with new doctests to make sure this keeps working.

BrainFreeze 0.1b2 - November 9, 2008
------------------------------------
  * Additional error checking to prevent name collisions
  * one_to_one() now only tries to proxy ColumnProperty objects, which is all it was ever
    designed to do.
  * Updated docs to explain that BrainFreeze supports object composition (as opposed to
    class inheritance).

BrainFreeze 0.1b - July 31, 2008
--------------------------------
  * custom setuptools 'makedocs' command now automatically generates project 
    wiki from the restructured text documentation.  "svn add" and "svn ci"
    must still be run manually on these wiki pages to get them into the
    google code project wiki.
    Resolves issue #1.

BrainFreeze 0.1a - July 31, 2008
-------------------------------
  * Full functionality was implemented and manually tested.
  * OneToOne documentation created with plenty of embedded doctests
