BrainFreeze SQLAlchemy Plugin
=============================

------------
Introduction
------------

BrainFreeze is an SQLAlchemy plugin that supports object composition (as opposed to 
class inheritance).  Google for "composition vs inheritance" to get the general idea.

Another way to think of BrainFreeze is that it's a plugin for proxying properties on
one-to-one related objects.  BrainFreeze uses SQLAlchemy's AssociationProxy for the
python properties, only BrainFreeze goes the extra step of making those properties
query-able using SQLAlchemy's session.query() machinery.

OneToOneProxy
-------------

BrainFreeze provides an SQLAlchemy Python Property that will take all the
foreign columns in a one-to-one relation and make them accessible on the
mapped class.

But wait! There's More! Also included is a SQLAlchemy MapperProperty that lets
these foreign columns be query-able just as if they were normal columns on the
mapped class.

Act now and you'll receive as our special gift to you, an SQLAlchemy
MapperExtension that sets this all up for you automatically.
