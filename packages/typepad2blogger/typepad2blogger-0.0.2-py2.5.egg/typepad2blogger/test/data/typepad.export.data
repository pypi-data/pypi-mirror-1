<p>So far, I see that the titling system is annoying. I guess I will have to pay more to get a custom domain.</p>

<p>Just checked, and my domain name is in fact available.</p>

<p>This is only the second week of grocery shopping on a budget -- $80 -- and already I have gone over. I have spent $90. But I think it's good to have some flexibility. I went over in order to take advantage of good deals with week on hams due to the Easter holiday, and I'm going to go over further when I stop at Dominick's tomorrow to get some cheap cereal, some milk for the girls, maybe some grapes, and some Johnsonville sausage.</p>

<p>Maybe we won't grocery shop at all next week. Except, wait, my parents will be staying with us two nights. We might have to get just a few things, but I bet we could substract this week's overage from next weeks' budget.</p>

<p>Since Easter is this Sunday, hams are on sale. I got one at Jewel for $1.29 a pound, minus a $5 coupon -- for a total of about $5 for the 8-pound ham. Last night we had ham and whipped potatoes (with some cabbage and cauliflower whipped in, which got a big thumbs-down from Epu). Tonight we had slow-cooker ham-and-lentil stew and a box-made birthday cake for Epu's dad, who dropped in just a day before his birthday. I put a ziploc of ham chunks in the freezer for a future split pea soup or whatnot.</p>

<p>Oh yeah -- also Epu brought ham sandwiches to work today and there is enough lentil/ham stew left over for Nutmeg and Pebbles and I to have it for lunch tomorrow.</p>

<p>This week I spent all my CVS ECBs due to a combination of factors: First, I made several mistakes on the Buy $15 Dove, get $5ECB promotion. I bought two six-packs of Dove soap, although only the two packs were marked on the display with the deal, because I had two $1 coupons for the six packs. They didn't pay out the ECBs, but I kept them anyway; after all, we use them and they were free with ECBs.</p>

<p>On a subsequent purchase I bought the large size Dove shampoo instead of the smaller size that was shown in the ad. Neither shampoo was marked in the store. Again, I had a coupon -- $3 off -- for the large size. I had a $3/2 coupon for the smaller size but I had already used it.</p>

<p>That shampoo didn't pay the ECBs either, so I returned it. I got cash back on a gift card, which is awesome since I paid for it in mostly or all coupons, but still, I burned ECBs without earning any.</p>

<p>And when I finally got that Dove ECB, I headed to a better CVS in another part of town to buy some Easter basket supplies. I figured I would buy $9 worth of Easter basket stuff and spend $6 on the kids mouthwash or something so I would still have some ECBs.</p>

<p>But that other store had NOTHING left that I could buy for decent ECBs, that I hadn't already bought the limit of. They didn't have the mouthwash display up like my store did. So I ended up spending my $9ECBs or whatever I had, paying a couple bucks cash, and leaving with zero. Wah.</p>

<p>I thought I'd have to wait until more deals come out Sunday to get back into the game. The best way to get started with no ECBs is to find a product that will pay significant ECBs for which you can also get a high-value coupon. </p>

<p>In the meantime, I stopped by the CVS near the kids' doctor after a checkup, and I used the ECBs I'd earned in my mom's name to buy the Dove deal again, correcty this time, and with more coupons so it cost very nearly nothing out of pocket. Also, this store had the tear-off rebate form for the kids' mouthwash. So that stuff, which was $2.99 and paid $2.99 ECBs, will now pay another $2.99 by mail-in rebate. I couldn't get rebates for both bottles because I'd bought them together and you have to send in the receipt, one per household.</p>

<p>I grabbed extra rebate forms anyway. Then I started plotting. I plot my CVS strategies during downtime, like in the shower or when nursing the baby. Now that I had a rebate form, I wanted to get those 2 mouthwashes that I could get on my own account. Not only would they be free, I'd get paid to buy at least one of them. </p>

<p>But how to buy them without spending out of pocket? There was a $1 Listerine coupon online, but I have not been able to get it to print out for some reason. It always says I have printed it the maximum amount of times, although to my memory I never have.</p>

<p>Finally I figured it out. Last night I popped out as Epu was putting Nutmeg to bed and did the deal, which came off perfectly. My favorite checker, who I usually see in the morning, was even there instead of the beeyatch who I usually see at night.</p>

<p>I bought:<br />2 Listerine Smart Rinse ($6, pays $6ECB)<br />1 CVS hair gel ($2, pays $1ECB)<br />4 Johnson's Buddies soaps ($4)<br />1 Johnson's Budies hair detangler ($3.79)<br />-----------<br />Total cost: $15.79<br />Used<br />Three $1/1 and one $2/2 Johnson's Buddies coupons<br />$5/$15 CVS coupon<br />$3/$15 beauty products CVS coupon<br />Total coupons: $13<br />OOP cost $2.99</p>

<p>I paid using that gift card I got for the previous return, so in reality the out-of-pocket cost was 0. Strangely, when I paid with gift card the total was reduced to $2.20. I got $7ECBs as expected.</p>

<p>I'm back in the game!</p>

<p>Today I have to take the kids back to their doctor to get their TB tests read. I'm happy about that because I want to go back to that other CVS, where my regular brand of hypoallergenic laundry detergent was on sale (it wasn't at our regular CVS). Planned purchase, with mom's ECBs:</p>

<p>laundry deterg $4.50(?)<br />CVS toilet paper and if it exists CVS Tri-Vi-Sol $10.50 (if not CVS brand napkins)<br />$15.00<br />use $5/$15 and $2/$10 CVS brand products<br />Pay $8 ECBs</p>

<p>I'll get none on that one, but that's ok because on my mom's account I currently have a $9, a $5 AND a $6. Plenty to start the new week with.</p>

<p>Wah! I just succumbed to the temptation to pick up a Sunday paper a day early to get the CVS flyer and coupons. Guess what? When I pulled the plastic &quot;ads and comics&quot; bag out of the middle of the Tribune, I thought it looked awfully thin. Turned out there was NO CVS flyer in there and NO coupon books.</p>

<p>:(</p>

<p>At least you could say the paper was free because I was buying gas with a $2 off coupon. Still, though, I could have just had the gas for $2 less without blowing $1.75 on a worthless Sunday paper. Lesson learned.</p>

</p>

<p>Today I finally got a bunch of stuff we really needed at CVS -- for FREE. Actually I came out 50 cents ahead in real money.</p>

<p>Here's how it went down:</p>

<p>I noticed recently that Arm &amp; Hammer Sensitive Skin detergent was on sale at a CVS in town, not our regular one. I also noticed I had two $1/2 coupons for Arm &amp; Hammer detergent.</p>

<p>I went to that CVS with my 3-year-old in the stroller after we had visited the library, which was about halfway there. I very nicely asked the clerk if she would mind doing two transactions. Here they are:</p>

<p>Transaction 1:<br />2 jugs Arm &amp; Hammer ($8)<br />2 bottles Crest mouthwash ($7)<br />------------<br />Total: $15<br />coupons: $5/$15 CVS coupon<br />paid $10 with a $9ECB plus $1 cash<br />Received 0 ECBs (but one $5 off $25 coupon on receipt)</p>

<p>Transaction 2: <br />1 bottle CVS brand baby vitamin drops ($8)<br />12-pack CVS brand toilet paper ($7.50)<br />----------------------------<br />Total: $15.50<br />coupons: $5/$15 CVS coupon<br />$2/$10 CVS brand products<br />Paid $8.50 with a $6ECB plus $2 off gift card and 50 cents cash<br />Received $7ECBs (plus another $5/$25 coupon)</p>

<p>So, since I don't count the gift card as cash (it was from a return that I didn't pay cash for to begin with), it looked like I had paid a total of $1.50 cash for $24 worth of stuff we really needed (and $6 worth of junk).</p>

<p>Notice something wrong with this picture?</p>

<p>I forgot to use the two $1/2 coupons! I realized this when we were a block away, and I turned around and went back. Fortunately the line had disappeared in the interim, so I walked out one second later with two $1 bills in my hand.</p>

<p>If I had remembered to use the coupons to begin with, we would have been even. We maybe could have thrown in a 50 cent item from the clearance bin if we'd remembered. Because I forgot and went back, we ended up 50 cents ahead.</p>

<p>I did make an error, though. I could have probably gotten a package of napkins, which we needed, as well. See, I knew that Scott toilet paper 12-packs were on sale for $6.50, a dollar less than the CVS brand. And I had a $1 off coupon for Scott. I had bought the CVS brand to make sure I could get the $2/$10 CVS brand coupon. But now that I think about it, I could have added a $2 package of napkins to fill out the $10 CVS brand stuff, bought the Scott tissues for $5.50 after coupon, and come out at the exact same total.</p>

<p>Drat! Well, I'm learning. And, not a bad haul for better than free.</p>

<p>Finally, I picked up a couple flyers with two more $2 off $10 CVS brand coupons at a table near the front of the store. They haven't had these at my local store that I've seen.</p>

The most expensive thing in the girls' Easter baskets was the fancy, natural raffia stuff I got at Cost Plus World Market for something like $4.99. I can't stand that plastic Easter grass, if they even have that anymore. The next most expensive things were not in the baskets but attached to the handles: Two Mylar balloons I got at Jewel last night. Those were $10 between them and were definitely a hit. They helped the girls find their baskets, for one thing.</p>

<p>Almost all the goodies in the baskets, I got for free or for a couple bucks at CVS:</p>

<p>Two packs of plastic eggs: free<br />One bag Cadbury mini eggs: free<br />One bag animal crackers: free<br />One egg full of butterfly tattoos: free<br />One &quot;growing dinosaur&quot; in an egg: free<br />One superball bouncy egg: free<br />One fancy lipstick: free (the color was way too pale for mommy's complexion)<br />One pot lip butter: 29 cents<br />One Dora the Explorer sew a pillow kit: free<br />One Sesame Street letters workbook: free<br />One Pez dispenser: $1.50 (this was supposed to be 38 cents on Clearance but I got overcharged!)</p>

<p>Things I bought:</p>

<p>One container baby banana puffs snacks: About $2 (on sale at Jewel)<br />One package clothespins with butterflies on them: $4?? (Cost Plus)</p>

<p>Things I just had around:</p>

<p>The girls' two Easter Baskets (Nutmeg's, I will always remember, cost all of 10 cents at a San Francisco thrift shop. and I love it!)<br />One leather bunny-shaped coin purse, which I bought in Japan years ago and love but never use. I filled it with coins and Nutmeg was psyched<br />A few chocolates left over from Xmas or Valentines<br />A plastic egg with something in it to make percussion sounds</p>

<p>In all I think the girls' baskets cost about $25 between them. CVS obviously helped big time here, so did the fact that I am still using the very small baskets from when the girls were infants. They get so many Easter treats from their grandparents that I feel like this small basket is plenty for them at home. I am also trying to set their expectations for not so much excess at every holiday as they grow.</p>

<p>The additional $5 in my Easter basket total went to metal die-cut buckets that I'm using as Easter baskets for my parents and grandparents. I'm doing these just because I have more CVS goodies to share. </p>

<p>Their baskets each contain the following, all free:</p>

<p>1 Dove shampoo<br />1 Dove body wash<br />1 Colgate toothpaste<br />1 lip butter<br />1 vitamin C or scrubby puff<br />a bunch of $5/$15 CVS coupons good for the next week</p>

<p>In other frugal news today, I was scandalized to see that the coupons had been STOLEN from our Sunday paper -- until I looked online and saw that there are <a href="http://www.moneysavingmom.com/2008/03/cvs-deals-for-week-of-march-23-29-2008.html">no coupons on Easter Sunday</a>. So that's why my first time buying an extra Sunday paper on Saturday was a flop.</p>

<p>This morning I went to Goodwill with my grandmother in search of a bread machine and ballet shoes for Nutmeg. We brought the girls, one in each cart.</p>

<p>No ballet shoes, but I did buy a Salton Nutritionist bread maker for $5. This evening I tried it out using this <a href="http://www.bread-maker.net/Bread-maker-recipes/Bread-maker-Basic-White-Bread.htm">recipe</a> for simple white bread. I don't think it's an especially fancy bread maker but it worked fine, especially given my YEARS old yeast and other subpar ingredients I happened to have around the kitchen. Also it was easy to clean and I have read reviews of quite expensive ones that were very hard to clean.</p>

<p>I also bought all this stuff:</p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=600,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://shopliftingwithpermission.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/03/24/26goodwill.jpg"><img width="100" height="75" border="0" src="http://shopliftingwithpermission.typepad.com/shoplifting_with_permissi/images/2008/03/24/26goodwill.jpg" title="26goodwill" alt="26goodwill" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>
The tab -- including the bread maker -- was $29. My grandma gave me a $3 store credit she had (and I also used her 5% discount card) so I paid $26. The skirt is from Gap, the leggings are Gymboree.</p><br /><p>After Goodwill, a good friend stopped by to drop off a couple items of clothing I'd asked to borrow for Nutmeg: a spring jacket and some rain boots. I didn't find these items at the consignment sale and I didn't want to buy them new.</p>

<p>So that was my frugal hat trick of the day: 1) Buy some needed and fun things second hand. 2) Make my own bread! 3) Borrow kids' clothing instead of buying.</p>

<p>All this happened up in my parents hometown, before we drove back to the Chicago area. Oh, I also stopped by the CVS in their town to see if they had the free-after-extra-bucks lip balm I've been wanting to buy all month. They didn't. But since I was in the store with nothing to buy, I brought a couple coupons my grandma had given me up to the counter and had them give me cash back off a month-old receipt. Hehehe. I'm not going to call that being smart and frugal though, because it made me feel totally sketchy and the woman at the store said they usually woudn't even allow it on an older receipt.</p>

<p>If frugality were a drug, the disclosures tag line of the TV commercial might read: May cause embarrassing public behavior, spam overflows and quizzical looks from people who don't understand. Tell your doctor right away if you find yourself chastising others about their spending habits -- it's really none of your business and nobody asked for your Suze Ormond impression.</p>

<p>Doctor, here are the side effects I've been experiencing: </p>

<p>1. E-mail box with more spam than EVER, or at least more spam than ever since leaving my newspaper job. Why? Because I was lured into signing up for an offer here that turned out to be very fishy. The promise was a lot of free diapers. Even though I quit after clicking through half a dozen screens full of ads referred to as &quot;surveys,&quot; I had already given my email address. Boo.</p>

<p>2. Pulled several coupons out of a magazine at the gym yesterday. OK, this was pretty cool. I don't think anyone saw me, and besides, it the coupon page was a pull-out with no content on the other side.</p>

<p>3. Found myself thanking my allergist for giving me prescriptions with refills, because I could get paid up to $30 for transferring those prescriptions to CVS. Yeah, because a specialist MD can really relate to that.</p>

<p>4. Got snippy with my parents when I saw they had gone to CVS and purchased CVS' imitation of Dove soap, and lotion, to use at my house. Tell them I have six months of the stuff stockpiled in the upstairs bathroom from last week's Dove promotion. Heads bowed, they confess that they couldn't even find the $5 off coupon I'd given them. Let them off the hook, realizing that they are too far gone for my help.</p>

<p>Yesterday we were visiting my parents in my hometown and Epu was fixing my mom's computer. He needed CDs and mom said she would run to Walgreens for some.</p>

<p>I jumped right up and volunteered to go to CVS instead. Yay! A chance to work some of those last few deals before the new week and new month begin! Luckily I am so obsessed with CVS that I bring my ECBs and coupons everywhere, even on this overnight trip away from home.</p>

<p>I was a little disappointed, though, that I had never been able to print the $1.50 off coupon for Clear Care contact solution. I was still hoping to try printing this on my in-laws' computer later that day, so I didn't buy any on this trip. I did a so-so transaction:</p>

<p>$5 five-pack CDs <br />$6.40 four cans of Clean Linen Glade for my grandma (2ECBs)<br />$5 two packs of Fig Newtons (got $2ECBs)<br />$2 CVS brand hair gel ($1ECB)<br />-----<br />$18.40</p>

<p>coupons:<br />2 bogo Glade coupons (-3.40)<br />$1/1 Glade<br />$5/$15</p>

<p>Paid: $9.40 ($6ECBs plus $3.40 cash), earned $5ECBs</p>

<p>I was bummed about having to pay cash because I had forgotten my recently earned $10ECB and $2ECBs back in Chicago. I had also taken the trip as an opportunity to case this less-familiar store for the March holy grail: Lypsil lip balm, which was free after ECBs, limit 5. I use a lot of lip balm, love it, love it, love it, but hadn't been able to find these things in stock anywhere. I was going to ask for a rain check for them on Monday.</p>

<p>But as I turned and headed out of the store, I noticed a display of all products that paid back ECBs. One-stop shopping for CVS freaks! And there, at the top, there they were: A whole row of beautiful Lypsil lip balm sticks.</p>

<p>The teen-age cashier, who had been friendly and helpful, was probably bemused by my totally out-of-proportion excitement about finding this stuff. She hesitated for a moment when I asked if I could do two transactions on two different CVS accounts (mine and my mother's), but then she let me.</p>

<p>After ECBs and coupons, I paid $10 cash for 20 tubes of Lypsil, and got $30 ECBs back. Yay! And I used the stuff, and it is phenomenal, one of the best lip balms I have ever used. And I have used a lot of them.</p>

<p>My mom was quite pleased when I handed her her &quot;free&quot; CDs (well, I didn't feel like charging her the $3.40 cash I'd paid for that transaction) and a few tubes of Lypsil to boot. If you count up the ECBs and cash I spent, I made a $6 profit and came home with almost all things my family or I will use.</p>

<p>Oh, by the way: I bought the CVS hair gel because I thought the Glade bogo coupons would ring up as just one sale each and one &quot;FREE.&quot; This is what happens at my local store when you are buying something CVS has marked bogo. However, at least at this store, a bogo coupon does NOT ring up that way. So I would not have needed the CVS gel, which would have cut my cash expenditure on that purchase right down to $1.40. Oh well, it goes to my local food pantry, so no biggee.</p>

I will buy practically anything at CVS as long as I make a profit doing so -- that is, if buying it generates more ECBs than I use on it, thereby allowing me to buy things we really need. Some toiletries we can't use are going to my parents and grandparents, in sort of a team approach to family frugality. Hey, we're their heirs, so saving their money is like saving our own.</p>

<p>I also have a pile of excess toiletries that will be going to our local food bank on a regular basis.</p>

<p>Then there are the crazy things. Today I brought home a tube of &quot;lip plumper.&quot; It's a tiny tube of lip gloss that was selling for $20. Yeah, it's supposed to <a href="http://www.lip-plumper-reviews.com/">make my lips fatter</a>. I have thin lips, so, what the hell, I put some on. I felt a little tingling, like if I had sipped from a glass of scotch. Now, nothing. I looked in the mirror, and they look shiny, but I can't say plumper. I guess the idea is to inflame the lip tissue a bit so they are swollen. The ingredient list is long and multisyllabic.</p>

<p>I feel sorry for anyone who would shell out $20 for this product. But for me, it enabled me to get large packages of toilet paper and paper towels 1 cent, so I'm cool.</p>

</p>

<p>A couple weeks ago I brought home several bottles of Crest Pro-Health Mouthwash. We tried it once and didn't like the saccharine taste. Then Epu heard at work that the stuff <a href="http://consumerist.com/369079/crest-pro+health-mouthwash-stain-your-teeth-brown-crest-pays-for-your-cleaning">turns some peoples' teeth brown</a>! Some people even said it inhibited their sense of taste.</p>

<p>Needless to say, this stuff is not going to the food bank. People strapped for food money have enough problems without brown teeth.</p>

<p>But are my frugal readers brave enough to try this stuff? The first three people to leave comments here will receive a FREE BOTTLE of Crest Pro-Health mouthwash, either daytime or nighttime version, by Priority Mail. Unopened. Yeah, it might turn your teeth brown, but it's FREE.</p>

<p>Even when I'm out partying, I'm on the lookout for bargains. This weekend, we were at a friend's Wrigleyville condo sampling the beer they'd made.* I was wearing the $4 Gap skirt I'd gotten at Goodwill and a couple of shirts off the Target clearance rack (about $6 each).**</p>

<p>Some woman mentioned that they were trying to sell their Roomba. I've been looking for a new cord for our Roomba or a whole secondhand Roomba, broken or working, from which to harvest this part. Our cord just started sparking one day, and when we investigated we saw it had some kind of crimped hole in the cord insulation. New cords are over $30.</p>

<p>When I tell the woman this, she offers me her Roomba for $25. I say sold. Before she leaves the party, a couple hours and many beers later, she reminds me about the Roomba transaction and I give her $25.</p>

<p>That was Saturday. Now it's Wednesday, and I start to think about this deal. I can't remember the woman's name. Actually, I'm not sure that I ever knew it. Yes, she is known by the hosts of the party, and the plan was for her to drop the Roomba off with them.</p>

<p>Will I ever get it? I have no idea. I sure hope she <em>remembers </em>selling me a Roomba.</p>

<p>Perhaps I was blinded by the potent combination of bargain lust and homemade beer. Still, I have an Ann Franklike faith in human beings met at small parties hosted by good friends. I think, deep down, that chick is planning on getting that Roomba to me at some point.</p>

<p>* Making your own beer: A frugal idea? I'm guessing more like an expensive hobby, but more on this after I interview my brother about the finances of his budding brewing hobby, which may turn into a small business.</p>

<p>** Shoulda taken a picture for you! I will next time.</p>

BODY:
<p>This blog is called Shoplifting With Permission because that's what it feels like when I enter certain stores -- mostly CVS -- armed with a fistful of coupons and little to no money, and walk out the door with bagsful of merchandise. You can hardly call it shopping when you don't pay or even get paid to take stuff out of the store.</p>

<p>I started this blog to chronicle my yearlong experiment in frugal household management. My goal is to significantly cut back on household expenditures to allow my family to more easily live within our means and maybe even save for home maintenance projects, retirement and college.</p>

<p>I also want to show how I'm incorporating frugal living into my personality as a young(ish), urban(ish) fun-loving mom. I'm not religious, I'm not a granny, and though I trend toward the bobo, I am not a homeschooler growing my own cotton from which to weave clothes.</p>

<p> I *am* becoming a compulsive coupon clipper, but I'm not a hoarder -- all purchased goods that we or family members don't use are going right out the door to Freecycle or the local food bank.</p>

<p> I've always been cheap, but since becoming a stay-at-home mom and especially since buying a home, I've had to dive deeper into frugal waters. Hence the advent of coupon clipping, CVS gaming and careful menu planning. That has brought on a wave of self-examination: I used to spend Sunday morning brunching in San Francisco restaurants and drinking $9 mimosas. Now I spend Sundays clipping coupons and planning my week's shopping. Does that mean I've turned into a frumpy housewife?</p>

<p>For me, the answer has been to adjust my self image from geriatric tightwad to <a href="http://www.cpop.org/images/Abbie2.jpg">60s-era rebel with raging Jewfro</a>.</p>

<p>That's right, I tell myself, I have not become June Cleaver in her declining years, I have become Abbie Hoffman. Because when I refuse to spend to excess, I am bucking the system. In the 60s, Abbie Hoffman's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Steal-This-Book-Abbie-Hoffman/dp/156858217X">&quot;Steal This Book&quot;</a> instructed on making your own granola and sneaking onto airline flights. These days, I can get granola for free by combining coupons with grocery store promotions, and I have enough frequent flyer miles to fly anywhere I want.</p>

<p>When Epu and I were picking up the kids in Kenosha last weekend, we stopped into a big Woodmans* by I-94. It's awesome -- huge, with a wide variety of organic foods.</p>

<p>Anyway, Epu spotted frozen young turkeys on sale for 88 cents a pound. We bought one and put it in the fridge. Yesterday, I roasted it.</p>

<p>First I cut open the plastic around the turkey over the sink so I could drain out any blood. I tipped the bird, and brown liquid poured out. I tipped it more, and it gushed out. </p>

<p>&quot;Gross!&quot; I said. &quot;How much blood did this thing have in it? And why is it so brown?&quot;</p>

<p>I was beginning to doubt the wisdom of buying discounted poultry at Woodmans. Then I cut open the whole plastic wrapper, and took out a plastic bag that had been nestled inside. It was punctured by my kitchen scissors.</p>

<p>It said: Gravy packet. Mix with drippings and 1 cup hot water.</p>

<p>Hehehe. By the way, the turkey didn't cook up that well -- it was underdone at dinner time probably due to it still being a little frozen inside. Then I had to microwave the meat we were going to eat at the last minute, which made the dark meat rubbery. So I guess you could call the whole thing a bit of a frugal flop.</p>

<p>However, Epu liked the cornbread and sausage stuffing I made so much he didn't complain at all.</p>

<p>We were lucky enough to be guests of members today at the Shedd Aquarium. Sharing museum memberships with friends -- I'll invite you to mine if you invite us to yours -- is a frugal idea in itself. But the trip brought to mind several other tips I've picked up for frugal ways to visit the Chicago area's otherwise pricey attractions:</p>

<ul><li>Chicago Public Library's <a href="http://www.chipublib.org/eventsprog/programs/kids/grkids_museumpass.php">museum passport program</a>. We used this all the time when we lived in the city. You ask at the library check-out desk for a museum pass. They pull out a small box of passes to area museums, including the Art Institute, The Shedd, Brookfield Zoo, The Field Museum (which has a new children's area), Science and Industry, The Chicago Children's Museum, The Notebaert Nature Museum, and a few others. You get to keep the pass for a week, and it gets four people in (for most places, that wouldn't count your free babies).</li>

<li>Free days, free weeks, even free months. These mostly happen in winter, but they are out there. Check the museum's Web site.</li>

<li>Free parking. Today we got into the museum for free, but we blew $15 in the parking garage, most unlike me. But my friend was wise enough to get there by or before 9 a.m., and she actually parked on the street RIGHT AT THE MUSEUM CAMPUS IN DOWNTOWN CHICAGO. It sounds crazy, but there is free parking near so many attractions even in this big city if you know where to look. Drive around your destination before you allow the signs to shunt you like a cow at the slaughterhouse into the paid parking. At the Brookfield Zoo, there is tons of free parking on residential streets near the rear entrance. At the Lincoln Park Zoo, the smaller, picnic-area entrance is also the end to look for street parking. At Science and Industry, free parking is all over the place. And, please don't hate me, Mommylu, but the cheap meter she found today near the Shedd was on Adler Street.</li>

<li>Pack your lunch and snacks. You know how expensive this stuff is at destinations. Don't hesitate to bring a stroller to the museum just to push around your heavy lunch bag. Or get a locker.</li></ul>

<p>And yes, memberships can be a good deal if you use one. A friend recently turned me on to a GREAT program that could be the only membership you have to buy for an entire year of family fun:</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://www.bostonchildrensmuseum.org/membership/categories.html">Boston Children's Museum</a>. Huh? Why would Chicago-area people sign up for the Boston Children's Museum? Here's why: Most children's museums and for that matter other museums belong to organizations that allow their members free admission to other museums in other cities. For example, we belong to Oak Park's Wonderworks, and our pass gets us into the Kohl Children's Museum, the Chicago Children's Museum, the Dupage Children's Museum, and when we went to San Francisco last month, we got into the Bay Area Discovery Museum.</li></ul>

<p>But why Boston? Because, for the price of $125 ($15 more than I paid at Wonderworks) that museum's members get access to not only all the children's museums in the Chicago area, but ALSO the <em>Association of Science and Technology Centers (ASTC) Travel Passport Program -<em>- which gets you into Science and Industry, the Adler Planetarium, The Field AND the Notebaert. </em></em></p>

I just wanted to comment that I love your new blog. I am a frugalite who worries about that making me a little Suzy Homemaker as well. Yet I get a big kick out of being thrifty...love the Abbie Hoffman viewpoint of it all. :)

<p>Once again, we went over the grocery budget this week. This time, I blame our discovery of the Woodmans at I94 as we leave Kenosha, where my parents live.</p>

<p>When I go over the $80 grocery budget I have set for us, I usually find myself saying, well, I stocked up on a lot of staples, so I will go under budget in future weeks. So far, that has not happened. However, I still do believe it will happen next week now that we bought a lot of stuff at this huge, awesome and worker-owned grocery store.</p>

<p>I don't know if all Woodmans are like this one -- the one we used to frequent in college wasn't, but that was a long, long time ago. This Woodmans had a whole wall of organic produce, for low prices although granted not the height of freshness. It also had a huge aisle of organic grocery, with varieties of organic food I'd never seen before: organic dried split peas and lentils, organic whole wheat flour, even organic Kraft macaroni and cheese (I gave that a pass in favor of the 50% whole wheat variety).</p>

<p>Anyway, with prices better than our local Jewel except for loss leaders, this Woodmans is going to be a regular part of our shopping strategy from now on. Unlike CostCo, they accept coupons (although this one said no Internet coupons). We're in Kenosha usually a couple times a month.</p>

<p>I don't have my receipts with me, because I am once again in Kenosha, but here's a rough idea of the shopping I did this week:</p>

<ol><li>Woodmans. $100-something. Dried beans, mac and cheese, yogurt, cottage cheese, cheese, milk, a 10-pound frozen turkey, a tube of Bob Evans sausage, a ton of citrus fruit for Epu's juicer, bag delicious organic pears, bunch bananas, large cantaloupe, lots of breadmaking supplies, brown rice, canned organic pears, whole wheat pasta and who knows what all.</li>

<li>Dominick's. $12.60. A triumph! 2 boxes Cheerios (each with a $1.50 Pampers coupon on back). 1 box Fruit Roll-Ups, 1 box Fruit By the Foot (brought those to neighborhood get-together Friday). 2 gallons hormone-free milk. 6-pack beer. (The cereal and fruit leather were a special Dominick's coupon at 4 for $4. I brought coupons for each of the four products, plus a $3 off your next visit coupon that had printed at the register last time. So basically I only paid for the milk and the beer.</li></ol>

<p>This coming week, I might pick up a few groceries at Target when I get a gift for a birthday party we're going to. I guess we won't hit Woodmans on our way out of town because the party location doesn't facilitate that.</p>

<p>I also did some shopping for the girls this week, and of course, lots of CVSing.</p>

<p>For the girls, I hit the local Mothers of Multiples resale event and spent $32.50. I got:</p>

<p>1 pair light up tennis shoes, perfect condition</p>

<p>1 pair light-up Barbie sandals, dirty (in the free bin)</p>

<p>Lite Brite, with plenty of pages ($1!)</p>

<p>booster seat for Nutmeg at the in-laws' house</p>

<p>1 pair nice shoes for school next fall</p>

<p>tons of socks, which Nutmeg desperately needed</p>

<p>1 cute outfit for Nutmeg (The Children's Place brand)</p>

<p>1 pair summer pjs for Nutmeg</p>

<p>set of knob covers for the stove (total serendipity as the baby just turned on the gas yesterday)</p>

<p>some sippy cups and tops</p>

<p>Halloween shirt (tags on) and turtleneck for the baby</p>

<p>tote bag to hold all this in, to be used as grocery bag</p>

<p>I did not find ballet slippers and may actually have to spring for a brand new pair for Nutmeg's very first ballet recital next week.</p>

<p>At CVS, I went pretty crazy Sunday and Monday because I had a couple coupons that would expire on March 31. I got 3 six-packs of Dove soap and a bunch of Ladies Speedstick for my grandma, a bunch of fragrance-free Speedstick for Epu, and some of the free-after-ECBs Softsoap body wash (monthly deal), oh, and that Pediasure, some CVS-brand toilet paper, napkins and paper towels, and some 90 percent off Easter stuff. I paid a dollar here, two dollars there, nothing really much out of pocket. Tonight I made my final trip of the week to the fabulous Kenosha CVS with my brother, and we got 3 Shout stain removers, 1 Windex, 2 Scrubbing Bubbles, a CVS-brand mouthwash, 2 CVS-brand tylenol, a Reeces' Peanut Butter Cup and a roll of translucent gift basket wrap from the Easter clearance rack.</p>

<p>The total out of pocket cost for that last trip was 23 cents. I needed the last two items to bring the cost up enough to use $11 in ECBs. I got $13 ECBs and a $5 off $25 coupon back.</p>

<p>Then I scanned my CVS card in the store's scanner (I used my mom's number for the transaction) and I got $2 ECBs (??) and a $3 off $10 CVS products coupon.</p>

<p>Yeah, that was fun.</p>

I remember subscribing to the "Tightwad Gazette" years and years ago and learning all the tricks of grocery shopping. (She eventually came out with several books.)  Keep track of when things usually become loss leaders, because stores are cyclical and you can predict when it will happen again.  

But as I got older and had kids (or didn't need to be so cautious with my spending) I got lazy.  I'm hoping your blog will inspire me to get back into the groove of things again!

<p>Today, despite my recent <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/is-target-really-just-as-bad-as-wal-mart">realization that Target is almost as bad laborwise as Wal-Mart</a>, we stopped into that discount design paradise to buy a birthday present. I had a coupon, which made it hard for me to avoid.</p>

<p>While there, I grabbed something I have been looking for a long time: Light slippers to wear in the house during summer so my feet don't get sore. Here is my cayute guilty pleasure, which cost about $17:</p>

<p><a href="http://shopliftingwithpermission.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/04/06/guiltyslippers.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=1066,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="100" height="133" border="0" alt="Guiltyslippers" title="Guiltyslippers" src="http://shopliftingwithpermission.typepad.com/blog/images/2008/04/06/guiltyslippers.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>
</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><p>My guilt over shopping in anti-union paradise was slightly assuaged by a quick Goodwill trip with my grandma, also this morning. After all, shopping Goodwill is good for the planet. And very good for me, today. I snagged these innocent pleasures for $4:</p>

<p><a href="http://shopliftingwithpermission.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/04/06/notguiltyshoes.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=600,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="100" height="75" border="0" alt="Notguiltyshoes" title="Notguiltyshoes" src="http://shopliftingwithpermission.typepad.com/blog/images/2008/04/06/notguiltyshoes.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>They are so cute, and very comfortable, with a velvety lining in back. I Googled the brand expecting to find out they were very expensive shoes. Imagine my surprise (and a little disappointment) when I found out they are from <a href="http://www.payless.com/Catalog/SLCategory.aspx?TLC=Womens&amp;PaylessBrand=Lower%20East%20Side%C2%AE">Payless</a>. They run about $20. Oh well, still a $16 savings for barely worn shoes. I wonder if they will fall apart quickly like Payless shoes I've had in the past.</p>

<p>Part of our $80-a -week grocery plan is to eat dinners with little or no meat several times a week. But if I don't plan for this I often find we have gone right through the week without remembering. Then again, last week I bought a bargain-priced turkey and we ate previously cooked meals from our freezer several times so that would explain why we didn't have any meat-free meals last week.</p>

<p>Anyway, new plan. Mondays are now the one night of the week when I know we'll be meat free. Unless, that is, I go shopping on a Monday and find a good deal on wild-caught salmon. Duh.</p>

<p>Tonight's meat-free meal is not quite meat free, but it is free of any meat I had to go out and buy. I've got some turkey chili bubbling in the crock pot. The turkey and stock come from that turkey carcass from last week (simmered all day along wth a bunch of broccoli stems and a couple of onions). Add one bag of black beans (less than $1), a couple more onions, a can of chili peppers clearanced at Target, a can of tomatoes. Then, say, shit -- I forgot to buy more canned tomoatoes at the store today.</p>

<p>I have plenty of tomato sauce. Maybe I should add a can of that at the last minute? I can't add now because the crock is full and I couldn't even fit in all my stock.</p>

<p>Accoutrements are leftover homemade corn bread from last night and shredded cheddar. I may also serve some asparagus on the side, unless I add some broccoli into the chili.</p>

<p>It makes me feel so good when I am able to bring home real necessities for free with my coupon clipping. It validates all the times I brought home crazy worthless things like mouthwash that turns your teeth brown and lip plumper -- those things earned me CVS money that made days like today possible.</p>

<p> This morning after preschool drop-off the baby -- I call her Pebbles -- and I stopped into CVS to take advantage of this <a href="http://www.moneysavingmom.com/2008/04/cvs-deals-for-week-of-april-6-12-2008.html">baby stuff deal</a>. I shoplifted with permission three weeks' worth of Huggies -- three jumbo packs -- and paid 23 cents out of pocket.</p>

<p>I used:</p>

<p>3 manufacturer's coupons, $1/1<br />1 $4/$20 ($4 off a purchase of $20) I got on email for adding an email address to my husband's CVS card<br />(this can be used over and over until it expires)<br />1 $5/$25 that printed out at a recent purchase<br />three $5 ECBs (Extra Care Bucks)</p>

<p>The coupons brought the $27 worth of diapers down to $15, which I paid with ECBs. </p>

<p>And, I got $10 ECBs back.</p>

<p>Next trip, I want to do this <a href="http://www.moneysavingmom.com/2008/04/cvs-money-maker-covergirl-and-pepcid.html">Cover Girl deal</a>, which should make me money. Which I can later spend on more diapers, TP, and other necessities.</p>

<p>I remember my old employer, a daily newspaper, used to pay $50 for a media appearance during off hours. One day I was interviewed on the radio by phone, from my home on a Sunday morning. It took about 2.5 minutes, giving me a pay rate of $20 a minute.</p>

<p>Today I got paid just about as well. I signed up for Revolution Money Exchange after reading about it <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/getting-something-for-nothing-my-25-from-revolution-moneyexchange">here</a> and <a href="http://www.moneysavingmom.com/2008/04/revolutionmoneyexchange-earn-25-when.html">here</a>. It's a new PayPal competitor, except apparently it charges no transaction fees. Great business plan, eh?</p>

<p>Anyway, it took me maybe 1.25 minutes to sign up, and my account now says I have $25. If I want to, I can now request the $25 be sent to me as a check, or I can keep it in there in case I want to buy something from the few people out there who are set up to receive money through RME. Plenty of other people, such as the Wise Bread writer linked to above, received the $25 in the form of a check with no problem.</p>

<p>You do have to type in your social security number. I was ok with that since so many people are online saying they have had no problem with the company. The site says that it is part of First Bank and Trust of Brookings, SD, which <a href="http://www.bankeasy.com/aboutus/">looks pretty legit</a>. That's the extent of the research I've done, people.</p>

<p>You should be able to sign up by clicking here, and by the way, if you do it through this link, I'll get a $10 referral bonus. That's 0.143 <a href="http://www.myfunnyfunnyfamily.com/2008/01/health-update.html">Cleaning Lady Units</a>! The deadline to sign up for the $25 is April 15.</p>

<p>But wait, you say. I'm not desperate enough for money to have this dang $25 sent to me once I sign up. No problem.

<p>You may have noticed I'm trying out some topic days throughout the week. On Wednesdays, I'll be highlighting new ways to waste money -- some commonplace, others hilariously bizarre.</p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=504,height=504,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://shopliftingwithpermission.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/04/09/feltflowers.jpg"><img title="Feltflowers" height="100" alt="Feltflowers" src="http://shopliftingwithpermission.typepad.com/blog/images/2008/04/09/feltflowers.jpg" width="100" border="0" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 5px 5px 0px" /></a> This inaugural Wasted Wednesday is dedicated to Pottery Barn Kids. Now, I like to leaf through the PBK catalogue on the john as much as the next mom, and I have actually ordered a few items from them, such as the Madison Bookrack, similar to <a href="http://www.potterybarnkids.com/products/sw710/index.cfm?pkey=cfrnbbk%7Ck&amp;cm_src=sch">this one</a>.</p>

<p>But lately I've noticed PBK featuring items that would generally be considered home projects: letters cut from wallpaper, for instance. This month, it's <a href="http://www.potterybarnkids.com/products/mt1010/index.cfm?pkey=xsrd0m1%7C40%7C%7C%7C1%7C%7C%7C%7C%7C%7C%7Cfelt%20flowers&amp;cm%5Fsrc=SCH">felt flowers</a>. Flowers cut out of felt with a little circle or star of felt sewed to the middle and a wire stem. $29.00.</p>

<p>That's right, twenty-nine dollars for a craft project even I could do with a few dollars worth of remnants from a fabric store or craft-ready felt squares.</p>

<p>I guess PBK is capitalizing on the popularity of crafts by allowing people too busy to actually make the crafts to still get that homemade look.</p>

<p>At least the felt flowers are pretty. PBK also wants $29.99 for these ugly <a href="http://www.potterybarnkids.com/products/md4900/index.cfm?pkey=xsrd0m1%7C40%7C%7C%7C1%7C%7C%7C%7C%7C%7C%7Cpaper%20daisies&amp;cm%5Fsrc=SCH">paper daisies</a>, &quot;the quickest way to make over the room for the party.&quot; </p>

In some ways she is my frugal guidestar, while in other ways, let's just say we don't share all the same philosophies.</p>

<p>But one thing she says that always rings true with me: Necessity is the mother of invention. She taught me the phrase &quot;jury rig,&quot; because that is exactly what she is always doing.</p>

<p>So this afternoon, as I stood looking at an opened package of Italian sausage and a lasagna recipe, I thought of Grandma. I didn't have any mozzerella, because when I shopped yesterday I wasn't thinking about using that sausage right away this week. But then <em>someone</em> (i.e., Epu) went and opened the sausage to cook a few of them for breakfast, and now I was faced with the pressure to use it up before we go out of town for two nights.</p>

<p>It's raining, one kid is asleep and the other is on the couch with a cold, and besides, I used up my grocery budget for the week.</p>

<p>So, we're having cheddar lasagna. What's the big deal, right? We all love cheddar. We had everything else: the noodles, a container of cottage cheese, and I just stocked up on tomatoes and sauce yesterday.</p>

<p>I'll let you know how it turns out.</p>

BODY:
<p>Here in Chicago it's still more than a month before it will be considered safe to put a garden in the ground, but Nutmeg and I will be starting our seeds next week. I was looking around for temporary indoor planter ideas -- I didn't want to use a milk carton because I'm not very good with knives and scissors and cutting one in half sounded hard, and because I didn't really want to have what looked like garbage perched on our house's beautiful window seat.</p>

<p>Then my new $2 Family Fun magazine subscription showed up with the perfect idea: Use eggshells for planters, and when it's time to put the sprouts in the earth, you can just drop the whole shell into the ground. I love this idea not only because it's cute and frugal, but because I hate touching dirt and this sounds like a really clean transplant strategy. I'm guessing the eggshell will dissolve after being buried so the roots can escape.</p>

<p>The magazine's Web site has a version of the idea <a href="http://jas.familyfun.go.com/arts-and-crafts?page=CraftDisplay&amp;craftid=10204">here</a>.</p>

<p>Which brings me to this week's family fun tip: Even if you don't subscribe to the magazine, Family Fun's Web site is so full of ideas for crafts, birthday parties and games. You can search it by keyword or by age category, or by what your kid is &quot;crazy about&quot; (princesses? bugs? sports? alas, there's no category of ideas for 1-year-olds who love touching buttons and saying, &quot;beeeeeeep.&quot;)</p>

BODY:
<p>I recently spoke to another mom who said she was working in a warehouse four nights a week to cover expenses her husbands check didn't cover, like &quot;you know, diapers, birthday parties.&quot; Birthday party gifts I'll save for another post.</p>

<p>But this week I brought home 3 weeks worth of diapers at CVS for nothing, and that feels really good. Sometimes I wonder if the time I spend clipping coupons and haunting the aisles of CVS are not worth what I get back, but then I remind myself that this woman is out there sleep depriving herself to buy the diapers. I got the diapers, and although it took some work, I was able to do a lot of that work with my kids in tow.</p>

<p>But first, the groceries:</p>

<p>This week I actually stayed within our grocery budget -- not counting alcohol. I spent $80 on food and another $20 on a bottle of wine and a 12-pack of beer.</p>

<p>Actually, I <em>could</em> rationalize this by pointing out that I spent $20 on a discounted nitrate-free ham which we won't eat until next week. So if I <em>lend</em> that $20 to next week's budget, you could say I stayed under. I am also thinking about a plan for buying a little beer, wine and spirits while sticking to the budget. So far, the plan involves buying a case of 2-buck Chuck next time we're at Trader Joe's, and getting more free or bartered beer from my home-brewing brother.</p>

<p>Shopping Trip 1: Jewel on Monday</p>

<p>spent: $55</p>

<p>bought: A lot of good deals on meat (I consider a good deal anything at $2.50 a pound or less, and all of these were.): Four pounds of chicken breasts (bogo), the ham, 1.5 pounds italian sausage. Some broccoli, some asparagus, 2 gallons skim milk and a 1/2 gallon organic whole milk,&nbsp; and 2 jars of spaghetti sauce (which were on sale of course and I needed for a mail-in rebate on my mom's purchase of &quot;101 Dalmations.&quot; Except of course now I can't find the receipt Mom gave me.)</p>

<p>Trip 2: Dominick's on Wednesday</p>

<p>spent: $45</p>

<p>bought: 2 cans organic diced tomatoes, 2 cause organic tomato sauce, 2 cans stewed tomatoes, 2 boxes whole wheat spaghetti, 1 gallon skim milk, 1 pack string cheese, 1 pound butter, 1.37 pounds green beans, 4 pounds navel oranges, 1 bottle Red Bicyclette Syrah and one 12-pack Goose Island beer.</p>

<p>As you can see, I drink a lot of milk. Not only do I like it, but since I have now spent more than three years of my life breastfeeding I feel like it is really important. I do take one calcium/vitamin D supplement a day, but the recommended dose is 3 tablets. I don't take 3 because you are supposed to take them separately and I have better things to do than run to the medicine cabinet 3 times a day. Because I'm too busy running to CVS three times a day, heh.</p>

<p>And here are my CVS transactions for the week:</p>

<ol><li>three 40-packs of Huggies (these last us about 1 week each) (paid $10ECB)</li>

<li>$25 in Aveeno products: one baby shampoo/wash, one creamy babywash, 3 small lotion tubes, one box oatmeal bath packets (paid $10ECB)</li>

<li>two tubs Cover Girl foundation (paid $12ECB)</li>

<li>1 Swiffer Duster kit and one refill pack for the Swiffer Sweeper, and a 4-pack of rechargeable AAA batteries (paid $10ECB)</li>

<li>2 more tubs of Cover Girl foundation, 4 CVS brand tylenols (two double packs, 24-ct each) and 1 CVS brand floss (paid $21ECB)</li>

<li>1 more tub of Cover Girl foundation, plus $20 worth of other Cover Girl stuff (pressed powder, 2 concealers, 1 lip gloss, shade of &quot;Hipster&quot;) (paid $16ECB)</li>

<li>3 bottles Febreeze and 2 Zooth children's toothbrushes (one will be Pebbles' first) (paid $7ECB)</li></ol>

<p>Total out of pocket expenses: $9.04 (that is high for me BUT I actually came out ahead on cash AND ECBs, see below.)</p>

<p>Total ECBs spent: $73</p>

<p>Total ECBs earned: $86</p>

<p>It appears that I got paid $4 to shop at CVS this week. But there's something I haven't told you. When did the third Cover Girl transaction (I use my mother's account as well as mine so I was able to surpass the limit of 3 Cover Girl foundations) I was overcharged. My local CVS had put the foundation on sale for $6.88, down from $9.49. I went back the next day and talked to my favorite checker, the same one who had rung it up the night before. She immediately did a return and gave me a cash card for $10.34. Then she asked me if I still wanted the item.</p>

<p>Now, I usually don't return stuff I've bought just for the ECBs because it just doesn't seem ethical to me. You buy the thing, they give you a cash rebate, and then you return it and pocket the rebate. I honestly can't believe it even works. And besides, if I am there all the time returning stuff, the staff at my local store will no longer like me or be super helpful with making sure all my coupons go through.</p>

<p>But in this case, since it would have been more work for her to ring up the item again, I felt OK saying no, I don't really want it. So now instead of being out $9 cash for the week, I have a debit card showing $9.52 (I used just under a buck on my last transaction.)</p>

<p>But for my own crazy accounting system, I will &quot;charge&quot; myself the $9 cash spent this week, and consider all the purchases I make with the debit card to be $0 out of pocket.&nbsp; </p>

<p>In addition to manufacturers' coupons, I used a $4/$20 coupon for each transaction except the last one (I got this from adding an email address to my husband's CVS account), and for most of them I also used a $5/$25, which keeps printing out nearly every time I buy something. </p>

<p>I had to call CVS to get the ECBs for the CVS-brand tylenol and the batteries. The batteries rang up $14.99 and the receipt said I still had to buy 1 cent worth of batteries. You know, from the penny battery bin. The lady on the phone fixed it for me and I hope to see those ECBs print out soon.</p>

<p>If I can get to CVS today, I am going to get some more Excedrine (free plus $1ECB w/ mc) because although it's a monthly deal the sale is right now and I don't want to miss it.</p>

<p>Monthly stuff I want to buy:</p>

<p>more CVS-brand tylenol</p>

<p>lots of Softsoap body wash</p>

<p>Heinz vinegar</p>

Once again, I promising trip to the store(s).  It's inspiring, I tell you.  One of these days I'll actually put all the work in and reap the benefits... until then, I'll live vicariously through you.

<p>Well, no one ever said we here at Shoplifting With Permission were angels. We have now committed what <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/trying-out-cvs-madness#comment-119708">at least one CVS shopper thinks of as a sin</a>: We bought a blood glucose monitoring kit that we don't need.</p>

<p>It earned us $14.99 in ECBs for NO money spent. Hard to resist, no? Here's hoping we can find someone who needs it. My guilt was assuaged a bit when my diabetic mother in law told me that the test kits are usually given away free or practically so because the companies make so much money on the prescription test strips.</p>

<p>Aside from the Contour Blood Glucose Monitoring System, this week's CVS bargains are pretty sparse, which is fine with me because I need a breather and a chance to catch up on some of the monthly deals.</p>

<p>I checked out the deals <a href="http://forums.slickdeals.net/showthread.php?sduid=0&amp;t=782194">online</a> last night while we were stuck at my in-laws' house (Nutmeg being too sick to put in the car and bring home. No big deal, just one of your typical kid sicknesses.). On the drive home I bought a Sun Times so I could pore over the photos in the CVS flyer and make myself good and car sick.</p>

<p>Here are the things that interest me this week:</p>

<p>Chef Boy-R-D Ravioli. 4-pack for $4.99, get $1ECB (both my husband and my grandmother have requested I get some of these)<br />Another Contour Blood Glucose Monitoring System , free after mc from 3/16 Smart Source, get $14.99ECB<br />CVS brand diapers, on sale bogo. No ECBs, though</p>

<p>I was also disappointed that we didn't get back to Chicago Saturday as planned because I wanted to buy a bunch more free Excedrine with the coupons I'd printed off my father-in-law's computer. But now they're not on sale for $1.99 anymore. Oh well, Epu points out that we don't need any at all.</p>

<p>Monthly deals I am working on:</p>

<p>More CVS-brand Tylenol -- Buy at $3.99, get $3.99ECB<br />Essence of Beauty -- buy 3, get $5ECB (my store has the $1.49 gift bags which I will probably get on my next visit)<br />More Softsoap Body Wash -- Buy at $4.99, get $4.99ECB (use $1 off mc from the paper and from the Internet)<br />Buy Heinz vinegar at $2, get $1ECB</p>

<p>I'd sure like to get some more $2 or $3 off CVS brand purchases, what with the good CVS brand offerings. I've even heard they work on Essence of Beauty products, since it's an in-house brand.</p>

<p>We always hear about it when my Grandpa wins at the track. We hear exactly how much he won and what horse he won it on. But we never, never hear a thing when he loses.</p>

<p>I was tempted to be the same while trumpeting my CVS victories. But now I will share with you a terrible, terrible CVS mistake I made tonight.</p>

<p>I actually went over there this evening to buy popsicles for Nutmeg, who is sick with what looks like her third case of pneumonia of this never-ending winter. They didn't have popsicles, it turned out. But as long as I was there, I put together a so-so transaction:</p>

<p>2 Chef Boy R D for $10 (pays $2ECB)<br />3 Essence of Beauty gift bags for $4.50 (pays $5ECB)<br />1 2-Liter 7Up at $1.86 (for the sick kid)<br />1 CVS-brand tylenol at $3.99<br />---------<br />$20.36<br />- $4 off $20 coupon<br />$16.36 plus tax</p>

<p>That's when it happened. For some reason, instead of taking out the $14.99 ECB I earned earlier today and paying with that, I slid my debit card through the machine. As soon as I realized my error, I asked the checker to cancel it and let me pay with ECBs.</p>

<p>She said it was TOO LATE.</p>

<p>This was the checker with the bad attitude who works on weekend evenings. She was actually in an ok mood, but she will never go out of her way to fix anything and doesn't know how to do a lot of things that the other checkers know. I'm sure someone else could have fixed it for me, but not her.</p>

<p>So I ended up spending my whole $10 gift card AND paying $7 cash. Sure, I got $7ECB, <em>but at what cost?</em></p>

<p>I just can't make peace with this loss. I am actually going to load the stuff into the stroller basket and go over there tomorrow and ask my regular checker to fix this for me. I bet she will be able to add the ECBs to the transaction using the receipt just as you can add a coupon after the fact.</p>

Hi Cindy,

ECBs are the "cash back" that CVS gives you for buying certain items. You can find a good explanation of the CVS system here:

Don't be such a tightwad. Yes I play the CVS game but if something happened to me like that and I still got $7.00 ECB back I would just forget it and be thankful I got them. Where else but at CVS can you need milk and think, "well, I'll buy a shampoo first and then when it giives me the exta bucks I'll use it to buy the milk. You leave with the milk and a Free shampoo. Great deal. Then people like you want to roll them forever and how long do u think CVS is gunna keep this up? Lady and your gunna go back and try to get them to refund 7.00 get a f------g lift. Ever hear of a 3 letter word called G A S !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Even if it is less then a mile from your house at 3.50 a gallon that is like 2.00 to get to CVS with the starting and stopping of the motor. Get a freeking life!!!

No, I didn't go back and return the stuff. But fyi to anyone who wonders, I don't ever drive to CVS. There is one very close to my home so I walk over, usually while out on a walk with the stroller. I will stop by other CVS locations, but only if I am already in the neighborhood for some other reason. Personally, I would not do the CVS game at all if I had to drive there.

By the way, to the commenter named MP: Your car gets 3 miles to the gallon? You should really get a better car.

<p>Today was crazy, with Nutmeg sick and Epu working from home so I didn't have to take the baby along to the doctor and -- as we suspected -- the hospital for a chest Xray. By afternoon Nutmeg was fine, rambunctious even, and I was very glad to have the ingredients on hand for a quick and easy meatless dinner:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/57123">organic red chard with pasta in cream sauce</a></p>

<p>I originally got this recipe from the tag on a bunch of swiss chard, and always loved it, but I haven't made it in several years. Mostly because we do not get chard nearly as often since leaving California. Anyway, it's quick and easy. The only time-consuming part is washing and cutting up the chard, but the latter becomes quite quick if you use a pair of kitchen shears.</p>

<p>I also served fruit salad of pineapple, pear and oranges. I got two small organic pineapples at Woodmans' this week for 99 cents each! They tasted wonderful and seemed pretty fresh.</p>

<p>I changed the chard recipe a bit because I didn't have paremesan. Must remember to always buy parmesan! Mozerella may have beefed the dish up a bit, but I missed the tang parm would have added.</p>

<p>I noticed something while cooking: With the high dairy prices these days, it's not uncommon for non-fancy cheese to cost more than meat. When we eat our meatless meals, we tend to go heavy on the cheese so we leave the table satisfied. But this cheese was $2.85 a pound, whereas the meat in my fridge was $2.50 a pound.</p>

<p>So is cheese a cost saver? Well, it is ready to use with no cooking. Also since it is rich we tend to use less of it. I put in 8 oz. of cheese when I would have added at least 16 oz*. of meat to the average meal. And cheese keeps longer even after being opened.</p>

<p>* Note to self: I should really cut back on the amount and use meat more as a flavoring, by stretching a pound of meat into two dishes or a double batch of a casserole or whatnot.</p>

Hi! I really appreciate your efforts to include AND enjoy meatless meals on Mondays! I volunteer with a project called Meatless Monday (check it out at www.meatlessmonday.org -there's good recipes and info) and I'm learning a lot about great meals that just happen to be vegetarian. Also, in response to your concerns about dairy costs--this is a really good point. And if you think about your motivations for including more meatless meals (whether for environmental, animal rights, or nutritional reasons), the "costs" are nearly equal for meat and cheese. Of course, moderation is really the best rule of thumb, but thinking about monetary as well as environmental costs is really important. Keep up your efforts!

<p>A few weeks ago I went to an allergist for the first time, and got that fun test where they prick the soft undersides of both your arms with stuff that's likely to irritate you. It's kind of like plunging your forearms into a terrarium full of bees and biting flies.</p>

<p>Anyway, the allergist was full of interesting information, including this tidbit: You know that popular and expensive ($1/day) OTC antihistamine Claritin? You know, &quot;Claritin clear&quot; as the commercials say?</p>

<p>It does not work.</p>

<p>I had noticed myself that when I took a generic version of Claritin that it didn't help my miserable summer eye allergies. But I assumed that was just me. No, here's a <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E0D7103BF932A25750C0A9679C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all">New York Times Magazine piece</a> from back in 2001 (when Claritin was <em>really </em>expensive, like $80 a month)</p>

<p>In one passage the NYT story explains that Claritin performs just a little better than a sugar pill:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;In one study, for example, people taking Claritin experienced a 46
percent improvement in symptoms at the end of the trial; patients
taking a placebo reported 35percent improvement. In another trial,
Claritin produced 43 percent improvement versus 32 percent on placebo.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Here's my allergist's explanation why: Antihistamines make us drowsy. Claritin contains a very low dose of antihistamine, too low to have much of a drowsiness effect. It's also too low to have much of an allergy relief effect. You would have to take about four Claritin to get effective allergy relief, but they can't tell you to take that much, because if you did, it would make you sleepy. And then they couldn't market it as the non-drowsy antihistamine.</p>

<p>He prescribed me Allegra, which he called the only truly non-drowsy antihistamine.</p>

<p>I can't really point fingers when it comes to kids' birthday parties. I have spent with the best of them: On photo-personalized invites with photo stamps, on themed decorations, on venues (we had Nutmeg's first in a rented house on the Russian River, but the cost of that was defrayed by the fact that both my parents and in-laws flew in and we all stayed at the house for several nights together). It's been true, for me, what Pamela Paul lamented in her new book, &quot;<a href="http://parentingsquad.com/book-review-parenting-inc">Parenting, Inc.</a>&quot;: The goody bags I gave out cost as much as people used to spend on the actual party gift.</p>

<p>Not this year. OK, for Pebbles' first we spent liberally, although we also got a great deal -- we hired a family friend to come take <a href="http://www.myfunnyfunnyfamily.com/2008/02/my-favorite-fatherdaughter-picture-ever.html">portrait photos</a> of all the kids there, and framed the results on the spot as send-home favors. She did this for only $100 because she is early in her photography career, and because she gave us a family discount, and we were so lucky to have her.</p>

<p>But anyway, we are now preparing for Nutmeg's 4th birthday, a momentous occasion, to be sure. I'll write a post next weekend about how we're putting together the party without spending a lot.</p>

<p>Yesterday, we passed out the invites at preschool. I didn't order photo cards, or engraved cards (lol), or even $5 Target fill-in-the-blank cards. We made them for pretty much free.</p>

<p>Here is where I would post a photo of the cute invites, except that I can't because our camera battery died and the charger is lost.</p>

<p>First, I had Nutmeg take a Sharpie and draw her version of a pony. The party theme is &quot;ponies.&quot; Then I took that drawing down to our scanner/printer combo and made 20 copies of it on colored paper. Then I had Epu cut out the ponies while we watched TV, and while I wrote the party info on the backside of some squares of card stock left over from, of all things, our wedding from TEN YEARS AGO. I recently found these in my parents' basement. And by the way, if you're handier than I am with a printer (our computer printer recently disappeared from the network, so this was not an option for us, just print out the party info on a bunch of labels and stick it on the back of your card. Or even run all the cards through the printer. If you're good at that stuff.)</p>

<p>The cards were originally left-over reply cards for our wedding. So Epu and Nutmeg pasted the ponies over the reply card text on the front.</p>

<p>Et viola! Cute party invites with charm galore, and 0 cost beyond materials we already had at home.</p>

<p>The point of this whole explanation is that kids' homemade art is cute. With color reproduction technology widely and cheaply available today, there's no reason why kids can't make all kinds of greeting cards, Xmas cards, wrapping paper, etc. If you want them to look really slick, upload the artwork to <a href="http://www.moo.com/">Moo.com</a> or another such site and order folding cards, postcards or whatnot from them. Not quite as frugal, but the end result is still supercute.</p><br /><br />

BODY:
<p>Last week at my husband's request I bought new toothbrushes for the girls. I didn't think there were any especially good deals out there for kids' toothbrushes. I searched around and found that if you bought a Zooth kids toothbrush from Crest you could get $1ECB. They cost $2.99. And I had a $1 off 2 coupon.</p>

<p>So I bought 'em last week and figured, that's $1.50 a toothbrush. One had Hello Kitty (which Nutmeg loved) the other had Barbie, and the baby didn't know the diff.</p>

<p>This week I realized I had a BOGO Zooth coupon from the 4/6 Proctor &amp; Gamble coupon insert. I went back to the store with my receipt, the toothbrushes, and the coupon, and got an addition $2.99 off.</p>

<p>Here's the kicker. Because my store now does after-the-fact coupons buy doing a return on the item, then selling it back to you, I actually got two <em>more </em>ECBs when I &quot;bought&quot; the brushes the second time. Oh, and I got $3 cash, when of course I never paid much if any cash for them to begin with.*</p>

<p>So I got 2 toothbrushes and they paid me $2ECB to take them. That's <em>Shoplifting With Permission</em>! I now realize that this deal can't be done anymore, because the $1/1 coupon expired March 31. But you could still get the two fancy toothbrushes for a total of $1.</p>

<p>So here's how you, the budding young CVS prodigy, could do this deal:</p>

<p>BUY two Zooth brushes for $2.99 each<br />USE one BOGO coupon (P&amp;G, 4/6)<br />Pay $3<br />Get $2ECB back</p>

<p>Or, you could do what I always do and buy those 2 toothbrushes along with at least $14 worth of other stuff, then use a $4/$20 coupon you get for <a href="https://www.cvs.com/CVSApp/cvs/gateway/viewextracarepromo?action=xtrapromoview">signing your email up with CVS</a>. And if your coupon for that has already expired, sign your mom's account up for email, your husband's, your children's, your grandma's, etc. </p>

<p>I took just one main grocery shopping trip this week, at the Kenosha Woodmans again. I spent $58 and got enough produce, dairy, eggs and misc. to last us through the week, along with the meat we had left over from last week (2 pounds chicken, a nitrate-free ham and a package of salami). Also bought cake mix and frosting for the birthday party this Sunday for my mother, grandmother and daughter.</p>

<p>I spent $6 on a quick Jewel run, mostly on juice bars for a sick kid.</p>

<p>I spent perhaps $3.50 on groceries at CVS when I forgot to use my ECBs.</p>

<p>I spent $2 on a grocery item at Target (strawberry preserves)</p>

<p>Add it all up, and I spent $70, $10 under budget! I had been meeting to spend that last $10 on wine, but now it's Friday night and I'm making do with some port that was in the liquor cabinet. I think I'll just forget about that $10, to make up for one of the past weeks when we went over budget, and try to carve some money out of <em>next </em>week's budget for wine and beer.</p>

<p>How we stayed under budget is no mystery: I didn't have to buy any meat. Also, I was able to use CVS and coupons to get FREE MILK which certainly helps. If I have time today I am going to stop by CVS one more time for a couple more free grocery items that are on sale this week.</p>

<p>At CVS I bought:</p>

<p>1) 1 blood sugar monitor $15.00 (paid $15ECB)<br />1 CVS painkiller $4.00<br />3 CVS clearance hardcover notebooks $1.50<br />-------------------------<br />20.50<br />coupons: $19<br />paid $1 ECB and 0.84 Out of Pocket<br />earned $15ECB (was supposed to be $19 but I got wrong painkiller)</p>

<p>2) <br />2 4-packs ravioli $10 ($2ECB<br />3 Essence of Beauty gift bags $4.50 ($5ECB)<br />2-Liter 7-Up $1.69<br />1 CVS painkiller $4<br />------------------------<br />coupons: $4.35<br />total $16.28 PAID $8.68 FROM GIFT CARD AND $7.60 OUT OF POCKET (AAARGH)<br />earned $7ECB (should have been $11 but got wrong painkiller again)</p>

<p>3)<br />1 blood sugar monitor $15.00 (paid $15ECB)<br />2 gallons hormone-free 2% milk $5.80<br />1 gallon hormone-free whole milk $3.59<br />1 small bottle Perrier $1.49<br />-------------<br />subtotal $25.90<br />coupons: $25.50<br />OUT OF POCKET: 0.72<br />ECBs EARNED: $15ECB</p>

<p>4)<br />4 packs of CVS brand diapers, 40-count (bogo) $17<br />2 bottles CVS brand rubbing alcohol $1<br />1 bottle Heinz vinegar $2 ($1ECB)<br />------------------<br />$20<br />$7 coupons<br />PAID $12ECB and $1.04 OOP</p>

<p>5)<br />2 softsoap body wash $10 ($10ECB)<br />1 EOB moisturizing gloves $4<br />2 EOB hand lotion $10 ($5ECB)<br />----------------<br />$24<br />coupons $6<br />---------------<br />PAID $17ECB and $1.26 OOP<br />EARNED $15ECB</p>

<p>6)<br />10 EOB gift bags $15<br />3 EOB nail brushes $6<br />2 EOB hand lotions $5 ($20 ECBs altogether)<br />-------------------------<br />coupon $5<br />paid $22ECB and $1.17 cash</p>

<p>EARNED $20ECB (should have been $25 but 2 hand lotions didn't pay off)</p>

<p>2 EOB gift bags $3<br />1 EOB moisturizing gloves $4 ($5ECB)<br />1 garden clogs $12.99<br />-----------------------<br />$20<br />coupon $4<br />-----------------------<br />PAID $15ECB and $1.07 from gift card<br />EARNED $5ECB</p>

<p>So in total this week, here's how I did</p>

<p>ECBs spent: 67<br />ECBs earned: 89 (should have been $17 more if not for errors) <br />cash spent: $13.70</p>

<p>cash received from returns/extra coupons: $7</p>

<p>So, I came out about $5 ahead, not counting the $4 gift card I received for one of the returns, which I will factor into next week's spending. I am still hoping to be able to return $19 worth of merchandise that did not pay the expected ECBs.</p>

<p>But I did manage to bring home some important items: 4 weeks' worth of diapers, 3 gallons of milk, birthday gifts for my mother and grandmother, and goody bags for my daughter's birthday (those Essence of Beauty gift bags will be the fanciest treat bags in town, heehee). I also got 2 items, totaling $18, for other people who will pay me a little something for them.</p>

<p>This week was supposed to be a really good week, what with the 2 free blood sugar monitors. But due to a couple screw-ups (paying cash instead of ECBs one day and buying a bunch of stuff that didn't pay) it turned out to be only OK. As for all the painkillers that didn't pay, I called CVS and they said that I was supposed to buy the <em>gel tabs</em> and I just bought the regular. As for the EOB products that didn't pay, I think I bought &quot;trial size&quot; bottles which are excluded.</p>

<p>Usually this is no big deal -- you just return the stuff that didn't pay off and use the money to buy the correct items if they're in stock. But tonight I tried to return the 4 bottles of CVS painkiller and 2 EOB hand lotions, and I was told that I would only be refunded the amount of cash I had paid. That was 84 cents for one painkiller, and similar tiny amounts for the other stuff. The only thing I ended up returning was the one painkiller I'd accidentally paid for in cash. </p>

<p>This is a new policy at my store, and they said it was because of a new manager. I'm going to try to return the stuff at a different store over the weekend.</p>

<p>Once again, not a super-hot week for CVS, but that's what I said last time and I ended up doing 5 or 6 transactions anyway. Today we plan to hit the Kenosha CVS where my parents live on the way to the birthday party for my mom, grandma and daughter. I am putting together gift bags for the ladies similar to the scenarios posted below, but I need to stop to get the non-EOB nail polish and (hopefully) some toe separaters.</p>

<p>Before I go into my planned scenarios for the week, here is a suggestion for using the Essence of Beauty promo to put together three gifts for mothers day or (in my case) birthdays. Total investment is $17.50ECB or cash, and you'll end up with $5ECB left over.</p>

<p>If you have any CVS-brand coupons (like $3/$10) these deals will be that much sweeter.</p>

<p>TRANSACTION 1:</p>

<p>3 EOB gift bags ($4.50)</p>

<p>2 EOB hand lotions ($10)</p>

<p>2 EOB nail brushes ($4)</p>

<p>2 toe separater ($2)</p>

<p>-------------------------------</p>

<p>$20.50</p>

<p>use $4/$20 CVS coupon from signing up email</p>

<p>spend $16.50, get $20ECB</p>

<p>TRANSACTION 2: (MUST USE SOMEONE ELSE'S CARD AS LIMIT OF 5 WOULD BE REACHED)</p>

<p>2 EOB moisturizing glove sets ($8)</p>

<p>1 EOB hand lotion ($5)</p>

<p>5 EOB toe separaters ($5)</p>

<p>1 EOB nail brush ($2)</p>

<p>1 nail polish any brand</p>

<p>---------------------------------</p>

<p>$24</p>

<p>use $4/$20 coupon</p>

<p>pay the $20ECB you just earned</p>

<p>get $15ECB</p>

<p>TRANSACTION 3 (YOU WILL NEED TO USE SOMEONE ELSE'S CARD):</p>

<p>1 EOB moisturizing glove ($4)</p>

<p>2 EOB toe separaters ($2)</p>

<p>2 nail polishes of any brand ($14)</p>

<p>---------------</p>

<p>$20</p>

<p>Use $4/$20 coupon</p>

<p>pay the $15ECB you just earned plus $1</p>

<p>earn $5ECB</p>

<p>So now you have 3 gift sets:</p>

<p>bag</p>

<p>nail polish</p>

<p>nail scrubber</p>

<p>hand lotion</p>

<p>moisturizing gloves</p>

<p>toe separaters</p>

<p>you also have 1 extra pair of toe separaters. The prices of nail polish are estimated, so these may throw off your totals by a bit.</p>

Marin -- You can get a $4/$20 coupon by going to this link

https://www.cvs.com/CVSApp/cvs/gateway/viewextracarepromo?action=xtrapromoview

and attaching an email address to your account. You can print out a lot of copies and use it over and over until it expires.

Once it expires, you should be able to get more in the following ways:

1) sign up another member of your household for a card.
2) add an email address to that account
3) you might even be able to get another one by changing the email address associated with your account -- but i'm not sure about that.

Also, I frequently get a $5/$25 coupon on my receipt at the register, and sometimes a $3/$10 CVS brand stuff either at the register or by waving my card in front of the card scanner at stores that have that. Oh, and a month ago or so I found some purple flyers at my CVS that each had a similar coupon on them.

<p>Sudafed is one of those expensive allergy drugs that my loved ones use a lot. I was actually just thinking about buying some more for our own household because I thought it might help augment my prescription allergy regimen. Today, I got 12 off-brand sudafed tablets -- AND I GOT PAID $3 to do so. Shoplifting With Permission -- for Profit!</p>

<p>It's an unadvertised deal at CVS, which I read about on <a href="http://www.moneysavingmom.com/2008/04/cvs-update-on-alavert-deal.html">Money Saving Mom</a>. Buy ALAVERT-D on sale for $6.99, get $4ECB. Here's the deal I did this morning which made it better than free:</p>

<p>1 Alavert-D $6.99<br />1 Speed Stick 24/7 $3.99<br />2 CVS brand Calcium with Vitamin D $4.99 (bogo)<br />1 CVS brand Dye-Free bendadryl $4.69<br />1 CVS pocket tissue $0.50<br />------------------------<br />$21.16<br />coupons:<br />$2 off vitamins CVS coupon<br />$3 off $10 CVS brand purchase<br />$2 off Alavert CVS coupon<br />$3 off CVS brand benadryl CVS coupon<br />$4/$20 CVS coupon<br />$4 off Alavert <a href="https://j.ovm1.net/wch1/universalreg/Registration.aspx?reg=true&amp;product=alc&amp;c=1240&amp;s=01&amp;p=ALV06001">manufacturers' coupon</a><br />$1 off Speed Stick <a href="http://www.randalls.com/sixframeset.asp?page=coupons">manufacturers' coupon</a><br />----------------------------<br />Total paid: $2ECB, 54 cents out of pocket<br />RECEIVED $7.99 ECBs!</p>

<p>Believe me, I would have been happy to pay $2.50 for the Alavert-brand sudafed alone. This stuff is $10.69 when not on sale.</p>

<p>By the way, pseudophedrine (sudafed)-containing medications are kept behind the pharmacy counter, at least in Illinois. I'm not sure how many of these one person is allowed to buy in how much time. But, according to Money Saving Mom, the limit for this deal is 5 times.</p>

<p>I have more $4 off coupons from the Web site, and some $2 off from this week's Sunday ads, although no more CVS store coupons for Alavert at the moment. I will definitely buy as many as these as I have coupons. Even only using a $2 coupon, that's just $1 per pack after ECBs.</p>

<p>Since we are still eating ham leftover from Friday, tonight's dinner was not meat free. We did, however, spread just a cup of chopped ham throughout a whole lasagna dish of german potato salad, topped with about 80 cents worth of cheese. I have two more batches' worth of the potato salad with 2 more cups of ham in the fridge, waiting to be frozen.</p>

<p>We're going to have split pea soup with the ham bone tomorrow night, and then Wednesday will be our real meat-free dinner. I think I'm going to make a peanut-butter noodle dish like <a href="http://www.peanutbutterlovers.com/recipes/nutty_noodles.html">this one</a>, which we love, love, loved. Since we have ton of organic carrots from our week-ago Woodmans run, I'll replace most of the veggies with carrots.</p>

<p>All this means I won't have to grocery shop at all until Thursday (except for free milk and Chef Boy R D from CVS), which is a good thing, since we already spent more than half the week's budget on booze. Heh heh. What happened is, we stopped by Woodmans again on the way out of Kenosha Sunday night, but this time I just hit the liquor store area. I bought 3 regular bottles of wine (with a $5 mail-in rebate), 1 large bottle, a 12-pack of beer, and a bottle of the whisky my parents drink, since they'll be in town this week. $47.20.</p>

<p>So I'm gonna try hard to keep the rest of the groceries for the week down to $32.80. Yes, I'm starving my kids so I can buy booze. No, wait, I'm not! Honest! I just told you 3 nutritious dinners planned until I shop on Thursday. And we have TONS of meals in the freezer, in case the end of the week needs any supplementing. And the dinners I planned will be large, with leftovers for lunch. And I can always bake bread too.</p>

<p>Feeding the kids AND feeding Bacchus. Livin' the dream, people.</p>

<p>Here at Shoplifting With Permission we are concerned about the high price of drugs. We like our alcohol and caffeine, and we sometimes struggle to acquire them without going over the grocery budget.</p>

<p>So it was with considerable interest that we picked up a little goody at the On the Run convenience store at the ExxonMobil gas station at the O'Hare oasis: Free extra caffeine shots to add to your coffee.</p>

<p>Now, we noticed that the energy drink Red Bull was offered at the gas station at 2 for $5. But we dont' do Red Bull, we do coffee. So we headed inside and poured ourselves a <a href="http://www.exxonmobil.com/USA-English/OntheRun/FoodCoffeeAndMore/FoodCoffeeMore_USMonthlySpecials.asp#start">77-cent special</a>. We turned our attention to the creamers, because -- this is embarrassing, but -- we like to drink about 10 creamers in our coffee. </p>

<p>Then we noticed it: A little creamer container, <a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=268,height=258,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://shopliftingwithpermission.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/04/22/stok2.jpg"><img width="100" height="96" border="0" src="http://shopliftingwithpermission.typepad.com/blog/images/2008/04/22/stok2.jpg" title="Stok2" alt="Stok2" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>
with the words, &quot;Black coffee shot. Equivalence: 1 shot espresso. 1 svg delivers 40mg caffeine. Limit 2/day. Warning: High Caffeine.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, we get enough of a jolt from the regular coffee, especially since we are breastfeeding and don't want to get our babies all silly on the juice. But we brought one home just to share with you, because these babies are free at the coffee counter. If you are out on the road and need more than a regular coffee, you don't need to spend more on a larger coffee or on No Doz or Red Bull -- just help yourself to one or more of these and juice up the java.</p>

<p>They are reportedly <a href="http://www.energyfiend.com/2007/04/caffeinated-coffee-creamer">also served at 7-11</a>.</p>

<p>I think most people know by now that you do not need to buy Baby Einstein videos or any other educational videos in order to help a baby learn. A <a href="http://uwnews.org/article.asp?articleID=35898">study</a> showed that babies who watched videos actually knew less words than same-age babies who didn't. <a href="http://www.pamelapaul.com/">Pamela Paul</a>'s recent book, &quot;Parenting, Inc.,&quot; revealed that these videos were originally marketed more honestly: As something to occupy an infant while the parent gets something done. </p>

<p>Far be it from me to fault a parent who occasionally needs a little electronic babysitting. I see it as a crutch that I try not to use every day, but might occasionally resort to in desperation -- at least with my older child. I do hope to stick with the <a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/114/5/1235">American Academy of Pediatrics' advice</a> and not show Pebbles any video until she turns 2 (except for the snippets she sees when someone else is viewing).</p>

<p>However you feel about video babysitters, there's no need to invest in an extensive video collection for tots too young to demand specific titles. And I've actually had people tell me they &quot;have&quot; to subscribe to cable TV because &quot;the kids must have their cartoons.&quot;</p>

<p>We have a few videos around -- gifts, library check-outs, rummage sale finds. But usually if I need a few minutes or I need Nutmeg (age 4 this week) to sit down and be quiet for a few minutes (often because she is tired and whiny but won't lie down and rest), I turn to two sources of entertaining, commercial-free video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a> and family movies.</p>

<p>I realized YouTube's attraction to my kid one day when we were searching for free downloads of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLZqEDO8b4">&quot;A Tooty Ta&quot;</a> song so she could dance at home like she does at preschool. I ended up with a bunch of cute kids in home movies doing the same dance moves Nutmeg learned in school. Then there were <a href="http://www.dooce.com">Dooce</a>'s cute animal videos.</p>

<p>These days, I'll run a search for &quot;cute dogs&quot; or whatever Nutmeg's interested in at the moment, and let her watch a short video, sometimes over and over, while I take my phone call or whatever it is I need to do. Sure, I run the risk that someone has appended raunchy S&amp;M videos to the last few seconds of a cute doggie running through the park, but, well, I'm OK with those odds.</p>

<p>Family videos are even better. This year a family we are close to back in our old home of San Francisco sent us a DVD full of short films they'd taken of our kids together with their digital camera. For awhile Nutmeg demanded that video every single day after school. Most days, she got it.</p>

BODY:
<p>Nutmeg turned 4 this week, and on Sunday we are having her entire class over for a pony party. I love putting together themed kids birthday parties, and it's an area where I tend to lose control of the budget. I see one cute theme-related thing after another, I buy way too much food and drink, etc.</p>

<p>This year I vowed to keep the expense down. In advance of the party, I made a few decisions toward that goal: </p>

<p>1) I didn't invite the parents, unless they really wanted to stick around. Most of them didn't. So I will only have to buy a few adult refreshments, i.e., I'll put a few beers in a cooler on the back deck.<br />2) I set the party from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m., and specified on the invitation that cake and ice cream would be served. So I don't have to buy lunch.<br />3) I am serving the cake on plastic trays with reusable plastic cutlery, not themed paper plates and disposable cutlery.<br />4) Although the party has a theme -- PONIES! -- it is not a commercially licensed theme, i.e., &quot;My Little Pony.&quot; I did buy a few My Little Pony things but if I had shelled out for matching everything -- decor, plates, cups, tablecloth, napkins, invites, etc. -- I would have spent much more.<br />5) I am shoplifting with permission as many party supplies as possible from CVS.</p>

<p>Here's a rough rundown of what we're spending:</p>

<p>INVITES<br />left over card stock, construction paper. Free.</p>

<p>REFRESHMENTS</p>

<ul><li>Cake mix and frosting: about $2 after coupons</li>

<li>ice cream: free at CVS</li>

<li>Juice and milk: free at CVS</li></ul>

<p>DECOR</p>

<ul><li>My Little Pony cups: $7.16 </li>

<li>balloons $1.19, Target</li>

<li>napkins left over from last party, free</li>

<li>My Little Pony tablecloth $3.29</li>

<li>maybe picket fence make of wrapping paper tubes and cardboard. Free.</li></ul>

<p>ENTERTAINMENT AND FAVORS</p>

<ul><li>pinata $12.99</li>

<li>pinata candy some free at CVS, plus $3 at Dollar General and $4.50 at Target*</li>

<li>pin the tail on the pony game: $1.49 for pipe cleaners used for tail. Epu will paint the pony on a large piece of cardboard, free.</li>

<li>16 pony-on-a-stick for riding $16 at Dollar General</li>

<li>2 stuffed ponies for centerpieces/prizes $12.48</li>

<li>2 cowboy hats $4</li>

<li>16 gift bags at CVS, better than free</li>

<li>pony stickers, $12.50 (+ some free at CVS)</li>

<li>My Little Pony socks $24</li>

<li>small toy ponies $15 after coupon at Target</li>

<li>My Little Pony coloring sheets with mini markers $3 at KMart</li>

<li>17 pony ear headbands: $17 for headbands, $2.99 for foam to cut ears, $2.50 for glue sticks.</li></ul>



<p>THANK YOUS</p>

<ul><li> $3, 3 packs note cards from Target dollar section</li></ul>

<p>It adds up to about $121. There may be more spending as we hustle to get ready today and tomorrow morning, but I am sure the whole party will come in at under $150.</p>

<p>By comparison, we could have spent $150 for a bare bones party at local kids playplace/museum <a href="http://www.wonder-works.org/parties/index.html">Wonder Works</a> (plus the $2 we'd spend on refreshments). Or $200 with goody bags and tshirts. Hmm, that actually sounds like a pretty good deal -- no prep work, no cleanup, similar cost outlay. I think My Gym would cost $250 or more for this size group, which is also not bad when you consider the work involved in doing it our way.</p>

<p>However, I wanted to have the party at home because summer is coming and I want all the school parents to come by our house and know where we live, and hopefully the kids will be encouraged to want to come back and play in Nutmeg's sandbox, on her swing, etc.</p>

<p>Also, I think the kids will remember her specific party more than they will remember another trip to My Gym, as much as they love that. We're invited to our second My Gym party this year already.</p>

<p>Which brings me to the next money issue with kids' birthday parties: Presents. I wish parents would get together and set an official price limit on kids' party presents, and that it would be low -- $5 or $10. I recently heard another mom say that her reason for working nights part-time was to pay for &quot;diapers and birthday parties.&quot; Doesn't it seem like something is wrong when kids' parties become such an expense that you have to deprive yourself of sleep and be away from your family to pay for them? And believe me, Nutmeg doesn't need 16 more toys in the house. Far from it.</p>

<p>What to do? I have received kids' invites that say &quot;gifts not expected.&quot; But I brought one anyway. I don't like telling my guests what to bring or what not to bring, and I do like Nutmeg to learn that she is expected to bring something to someone at a birthday. I just wish there was some agreement among parents that these gifts would be tokens. At Pebbles' recent birthday, we unwrapped gifts including multiple items -- i.e. a nice outfit and a nice toy -- from people who were not even relatives. They were lovely, and the sentiment is very kind, but... Must I reciprocate at this level?</p>

<p>Well, maybe the thing to do is just to give modestly, with homemade elements (i.e. including homemade play-do or home-molded crayons), and hope that others remember when it's our turn again that it's ok with us to receive a modest gift as well.</p>

<p>And there's always the toy aisle of CVS.</p>

<p>* I actually bought TOO MUCH candy, which sucks, because that's the last thing I want lying around the house. I should have stuck with what I got for free at CVS.</p>

BODY:
<p>This week I spent the bulk of our food budget on booze! But we got through the week just fine anyway.</p>

<p>Here's my shopping:</p>

<p>SUNDAY: $47.20 on wine, whisky and beer at Woodman's<br />FRIDAY: Epu spent $7 on whipped cream and eggs at Jewel (he went the moment it opened so we could make our birthday girl chocolate chip pancakes!)<br />FRIDAY: I spent $5 on milk and juice at CVS (accidentally spent real money!) and $66 on all kinds of groceries at Fair Share Foods, a low-cost supermarket here in Oak Park.</p>

<p>Total: $125.20</p>

<p>Now, my weekly grocery budget is $80. But since I didn't get to the store until Friday -- and since I went to a farther store in the car instead of walking to a close one -- I decided to use a chunk of this week's budget as well. So for the coming week, I have $45.20 left to spend. I may not need it, though, because I got a LOT of stuff at Fair Share, enough meat and fruit to last the week for sure. I may need to buy more fresh vegetables because the ones they had there were pretty poor.</p>

<p>Especially good deals at Fair Share:</p>

<ul><li>4 boxes of GM cereal for $5, used with 2 $1/2 coupons = 75 cents a box</li>

<li>1 box pizza rolls at $1, with a 40 cent coupon = 60 cents a box</li>

<li>clearance Newman's Own salad dressing at 99 cents</li>

<li>clearance yogurts at 20 cents each</li>

<li>cage-free eggs at 2.59 minus 55 cent coupon = $2.04 a dozen</li></ul>

<p>The produce was all dirt-cheap, like 99 cents a pound or less, and the meat wasn't more than that either. But we'll see about the quality of that stuff. </p>

<p>If I go back to this store, it will only be in the stroller, because the shopping carts had NO SEATBELTS. Otherwise, though, the staff was friendly and helpful, and it was not at all crowded, so despite being a low-budget store the experience was good.</p>

<p>I was able to give 2 $1/2 cereal coupons to another mom who was studying the sale-priced cereals as well. Since the limit was 4 and they were soon to expire, I thought it was great that they would get used.</p>



<p>As for CVS, I had mixed results this week. The <a href="http://www.moneysavingmom.com/2008/04/cvs-update-on-alavert-deal.html">Alavert</a> promotion was a blessing and a curse -- it was a great deal since I was able to print off unlimited <a href="https://j.ovm1.net/wch1/universalreg/Registration.aspx?reg=true&amp;product=alc&amp;c=1240&amp;s=01&amp;p=ALV06001">$4 coupons</a>, but I had to go to the pharmacy counter every time and Illinois has a limit on how much sudafed-containing products you can buy. Sometimes I asked for two and could only buy one, which messed with my deal scenarios.</p>

<p>This led into my worse CVS crisis of the week: I went to the pharmacy counter to buy 2 Alaverts and get 8 ECBs, which I was going to use toward supplies for my daughter's party. I could only get one Alavert, so I ended up with only $4ECB to spend. But then my kids pulled all the pamphlets off the display rack by the pharmacy, and while picking them up (and trying to contain my toddler at same time) I must have lost the ECB slip! I got up to the front and ended up paying $16 cash for a bunch of pony stickers for the party.</p>

<p>Oh well, at any other store the visit would have been a bargain:</p>

<p>1 Alavert</p>

<p>10 packs stickers</p>

<p>2 bottles juice</p>

<p>1 gallon milk</p>

<p>1 half-gallon milk</p>

<p>2 jars peanuts</p>

<p>returned: 5 EOB toe separators</p>

<p>-------------------</p>

<p>total out of pocket: $13</p>

<p>Here's my total CVS haul for the week:</p>

<p>7 Alavert (paid $28ECB)</p>

<p>1 large Softsoap body wash (paid $5.49ECB)</p>

<p>6 Hershey candy at bogo</p>

<p>2 half-gallons milk</p>

<p>2 gallons milk</p>

<p>2 jars peanuts (bogo)</p>

<p>candy bar (filler)</p>

<p>2 Aveeno</p>

<p>1 Wite Out</p>

<p>2 twin-packs Lysol wipes</p>

<p>1 double-sided tape</p>

<p>1 clearance CD</p>

<p>1 clearance gel pen</p>

<p>1 4-pack ravioli (paid $1ECB)</p>

<p>1 get-well card</p>

<p>2 CVS-brand calcium (bogo)</p>

<p>1 CVS-brand pocket tissue 50c</p>

<p>CVS-brand benadryl</p>

<p>1 Speed Stick</p>

<p>1 Dove chocolates</p>

<p>1 Miracle Whip</p>

<p>10 packs stickers</p>

<p>2 bottles juice</p>

<p>------------------------</p>

<p>Total out of pocket: $19.29 (aargh!)</p>

<p>minus return of $5.30, oop = $14</p>

<p>minus reimbursed from others: $18</p>

<p>oop = -4</p>

<p>ECBs spent: $64.50</p>

<p>ECBs earned: $34.49 (four lost!)</p>

<p>-------------------------------</p>

<p>So I ended up with 30 ECBs less this week.&nbsp; Which is fine because they were really building up and I took the opportunity to supplement our grocery bill and supply my daughter's birthday party. The out-of-pocket total would have been higher if not for 2 things: I used gift cards for previous returns, and my mom reimbursed me $18 for stuff I bought for her -- Lysol, Miracle Whip, 3 bags of candy, and Wite Out. I gave her a bunch of Alavert for free.</p>

I've heard that if you are in the online Extracare system that you can print off your ECB's (that you haven't used) - that you can use those if you lost some ECB's. Now I've never tried this but I've wondered what would happen if I ever did lose my ECB's and didn't have cash to "cover" my scenario but I heard that CVS lovers can do this - and the reason why is that the ECB's have codes on them so that if you tried to use both, the printed out one and the regular one - it'd beep and the cashier would know. So you may be able to get those "lost" ECB's back....

Tell us if it works - I've often wondered!!

<p>With my daughter's birthday party this afternoon, I shouldn't be doing this. But I looked over the <a href="http://forums.slickdeals.net/showthread.php?sduid=0&amp;t=749965">Slick Deals</a> and <a href="http://www.moneysavingmom.com/">Money Saving Mom</a> while watching Saturday Night Live, and I have one idea for a deal to do after the party. It's nothing I need much, but it is a moneymaker with all the coupons. I have a ton of coupons to use up, some of which expire tomorrow:</p>

<p>1 Neutrogena mascara, $6<br />1 Neutrogena foundation, $10<br />2 Soleil razors, $12<br />-------------------<br />$28<br />-$4/$20 beauty coupon (got in email)<br />-$4/$20 coupon (got for signing up email to cvs account)<br />-$3/$15 Neutrogena cosmetics crt<br />-$5/$25 crt<br />-$3/2 Neutrogena cosmetcs mc<br />-$2/1 Soleil<br />-$2/1 Soleil<br />----------------------<br />Pay $5 ECB or OOP<br />Get 6 ECBs for Soleil, 2 ECBs for Neutrogena</p>

<p>Ho hum.</p>

<p>Although we are all exhausted after having 13(?) wily preschoolers running around our house this afternoon, I just returned from a quick CVS trip. I realized that those Soleil razors and refills were too good a deal to pass up, and that my mcs for them expire today.</p>

<p>I thought I would do 2 deals that both made a lot of money, but unfortunately my $4/$20 beauty coupon would not scan. It seems they've gotten pickier about what constitutes &quot;beauty.&quot; It lists a few examples on the coupon and says, &quot;and more.&quot; I'm glad they list the examples, &quot;cosmetics, skin care, sun care, hair care and more,&quot; because one clerk in the past told me &quot;beauty&quot; meant only &quot;makeup.&quot;</p>

<p>Here are the 2 deals I did, one a moneymaker and one that will become a moneymaker once I buy that 3rd (and last) EOB product:</p>

<p>Transaction I:<br />1 Bic Soleil Razor $5.99<br />3 Soleil cartridges 17.97<br />1 Johnson's Buddies Soap 0.99<br />----------------------------<br />24.95<br />-$4/$20 cvs email coupon<br />-$5/$25 crt coupon<br />-$2 Soleil mc<br />-$2 Soleil mc<br />-$2 Soleil mc<br />-$2 Soleil mc<br />-$1 Buddies mc<br />-------------<br />6.95 + tax<br />paid $6ECB and 1.87 from gift card<br />received $12ECB (and another $5/$25 crt!)</p>

<p>Transaction II:<br />2 Soleil Razors 11.98<br />1 Soleil refill 5.99<br />2 EOB gift bags (they restocked!) 2.98<br />-----------------------------<br />20.95<br />-$4/$20<br />-$2 Soleil mc<br />-$2 Soleil mc<br />-$2 Soleil mc<br />-------------------------------<br />$10.95 + tax<br />I paid $10ECB and $1.58 off gift card<br />received $9ECB</p>

<p>So altogether, if I count the next time I spend $1.50 on an EOB gift bag, I'll have spent $19.50 to get $26ECBs. Oh yeah, and a lot of fancy razors. At least this time they also offered ECBs and coupons for the refills.</p>

<p>Since Nutmeg's birthday party yesterday had a pony theme, she received several &quot;My Little Pony&quot; gifts. In a couple of them was a handy flyer showing all kinds of other &quot;My Little Pony&quot; products she could pester us to buy.</p>

<p>After she went to bed I disposed of that advertising. I have enough aggravation in my life and have no intention of spending a single dime of my hard shoplifted money on any more TV-show-branded plastic.</p>

<p>But before I threw it out, I noticed there was a handy coupon code on the flyer. It says it's only good for &quot;My Little Pony&quot; products, but I'll try it on anything if I happen to order from there:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hasbrotoyshop.com/Default.htm">Hasbrotoyshop.com</a></p>

<p>10% off</p>

<p>code: PONY10</p>

<p>OK, you'd think I don't <em>like </em>cooking vegetarian, but I do, I really do. My excuse this week is that I bought 4 pounds of spare ribs at the cheapo grocery store on Friday, and I don't trust it to be fresh enough to wait any longer. I've got <a href="http://southernfood.about.com/od/crockpotporkribs/r/bl89c5.htm?p=1">this</a> cooking in the crockpot.</p>

<p>I also took two meals' worth of chicken, rice and beans out of the freezer yesterday, hoping to have them for dinner. But I remembered them so late (in the middle of the birthday party) and we didn't feel like defrosting them so we had breakfast for dinner instead.</p>

<p>So, maybe Wednesday I'll cook a meatless meal? I'm thinking something with potatoes and eggs, like <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=It6ySlOx8b8C&amp;pg=PA489&amp;lpg=PA489&amp;dq=jane+brody+potato+souffle&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Xgyp6dbLPg&amp;sig=3-igPvzr678z9vzsou7ErNa_17g&amp;hl=en">Jane Brody's potato souffle</a> which I have always wanted to try. I actually have parmesan for once. Maybe I'll wait until I grocery shop on Thursday so I can pick up some mushrooms for it.</p>

<p>I had two good transactions at CVS today and one bad one, and I learned something.</p>

<p>OK, but first, in my defense: I don't normally go to CVS three times in one day. Honest! But the monthly deals end this week, I have coupons expiring, and I had a short list of deals that I wanted to get done before those things happened.</p>

<p>Here's what happened with the bad deal: I stopped by the CVS near my gym, once again during the busy time of day and with two tired kids. Once again I got hassled about all the coupons I was trying to use as the baby tried to wriggle out of my arms and the 4-year-old wandered around touching all the candy.</p>

<p>In the end, they disallowed one of my coupons AND made me buy something extra, and the deal I though would be a moneymaker actually cost me $3.</p>

<p>Besides the obvious lessons -- don't drag two kids to CVS when they're tired and it's busy, and don't try to stack coupons at this other, stricter CVS store -- I learned something more fundamental: Only do a deal if a) you really want the stuff or b) you are going to make a significant amount of money on it. Preferably, both.</p>

<p>Because if something goes wrong, as it often does -- a disallowed coupon, you can't get an item you're looking for, you get the wrong thing -- and you end up a few dollars off, you will be really annoyed if you didn't want the stuff AND you don't end up making money. Suddenly you'll realize you just spent a half hour in hell -- trying to hold down toddlers and work out a complicated transaction in a busy store -- for nothing.</p>

<p>On the upside, once I looked at my purchases, which I had mainly bought as a moneymaker, I realized that I really did want them. It was the Neutrogena makeup deal. I recently bought a bunch of CoverGirl foundation as a moneymaker, but this Neutrogena foundation looks much better. It's made of titanium dioxide, the same stuff that expensive Mustella baby sunblock (recommended by our pediatrician) is made out of. Has SPF20. And I read that Neutrogena cosmetics and other facial products are the best for your skin. I already use some of their other stuff and am a fan.</p>

<p>The other item in the promo was mascara, and I had been wanting to get some of that too.</p>

<p>Since I have the $4/$20 beauty coupon that was sent out in email, and those things cost $16, I rounded it out with two tubes of that Lumene Body Aktiva firming moisturizer. These were $2 each and free after ECBs.</p>

<p>Not only is the concept of a firming cream the silliest thing since the lip plumper I shoplifted with permission a few weeks ago, the tubes actually say &quot;FUKTLOTION&quot; on the back,&nbsp; in the apparently Finnish-language portion.</p>

<p>Which leads me to wonder just what this stuff is supposed to be firming. Eh? Eh?</p>

<p>Today we are going to try to stop at Ben &amp; Jerry's before heading over to my volunteer job, because they are giving out <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/free-ice-cream-day-is-tomorrow">FREE ICE CREAM CONES</a>.&nbsp; You can check <a href="http://www.benjerry.com/scoop_shops/">here</a> to see if one near you is participating. I'm hoping the line is not too long, or we won't be able to squeeze it in between Pebbles' nap and my 4:30 work time.</p>

<p>If you miss out on that, tomorrow is <a href="http://www.baskinrobbins.com/Promotion/31cent.aspx">31-cent scoop night</a> at Baskin Robbins. From 5 p.m. to 10 p.m., you can get a little cone (perfect size for the kids) for just that much. It's to support The National Fallen Firefighters Foundation.</p>

<p>And speaking of free ice cream, I did some searching around on free ice cream birthday clubs for Nutmeg's recent birthday. I found out that if your birthday is imminent, the best place to sign up for a free scoop is Baskinrobbins.com. Their Web form actually works, and it lets you print out a coupon right away that you can use for a few days after your birthday. If you want to get free birthday ice cream at other stores, I would recommend filling out the postcards or forms they give out at the physical store, because I have found the Web sites to be impossible.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the one day we were near the BR last week, I forgot Nutmeg's coupon. Now that we are probably getting free cones at B&amp;J today, the only day I'll have left before Nutmegs' expires is the 31-cent day. Which is like, big whoop, right?</p>

<p>Then again, there is nothing to stop me from signing up, say, Pebbles for the birthday club on the Web site, saying her birthday is next week, and borrowing her coupon to give to Nutmeg. Yes, that's not honest, but if we don't get to use the original coupon we got, I don't feel that bad about it.</p>

<p>Finally, there was a coupon in this past weekend's coupon newspaper insert for a free small soft serve at BR. So if you're accompanying your birthday kid, you or a sibling can also get a cone.</p>&nbsp;

<p>So, my big plan was to stop by Ben &amp; Jerry's for free ice cream on my way to my 4:30 p.m. volunteer job. I thought, since it was during the workday and chilly out, that getting there by about 3:55 would be enough time to wait in line and then walk over.</p>

<p>Ha. Ha ha ha.</p>

<p>As I was driving down the road toward the ice cream shop, I noticed something: Lots of teenagers holding ice cream cones. Somehow it had totally escaped me that while a lot of adults are still at work at 4 p.m., KIDS are out of school by then. Like, duh. </p>

<p>Also, afternoon traffic was slow. By the time I put my car in the free (for the first 2 hours) garage and walked over the the B&amp;Js, it was 4:15. We would barely have time to buy ice cream and walk to my volunteer job if there was NO line. </p>

<p>Yet somehow I had let it slip to my 4-year-old that we were going for a treat. That's how I ended up around the corner at the Cold Stone Creamery, home of the world's most expensive ice cream.</p>

<p>But there on the menu, it said &quot;kids cones&quot; were 49 cents. What a deal! Wow, I said to the kids, I'd way rather pay a measly buck than wait in that long line.</p>

<p>I ordered one for Nutmeg and even one for baby Pebbles. I was expecting a tiny scoop on a little cone. They actually gave them huge scoops, more than they could eat, with a free mix-in.</p>

<p>Again, I'm thinking, this is a hell of a deal. Then the guy rings it up: $5.63.</p>

<p>Turns out, the kids' CONE is 50 cents. The ice cream? That costs extra.</p>

<p>Guess it was too good to be true.</p>

<p>Well, there's always next year, when I'm sure I will get it together to take the girls over to B&amp;J nice and early in the day. But this year, Free Cone Day is officially a frugal flop for me.</p>

BODY:
<p>A friend recently commented to me that she ends up going out at the last minute to shop for dinner even though her cupboards are full -- because she has no idea what she has in there or what she could whip up with the disparate ingredients.</p>

<p>I have already noticed, after a few weeks of using a weekly grocery budget, that this is one way to get rid of the &quot;full cupboards/nothing to eat&quot; syndrome. If you have used up your weekly allotment on wine, whiskey and beer like we did, you durn well find something you can make out of stale bread, canned salmon and rice.</p>

<p>When I want to use up what I have and I don't have a recipe in mind, I use a very simple tactic: I google the foods, whatever they are. Sometimes I throw in the word &quot;recipe.&quot; I almost always find something that incorporates those foods into one dish, and sometimes it is even good.</p>

<p>But I decided to do a little searching this week for other suggestions on using up what you have. After all, when you're on a budget, there are few feelings worse than realizing you've let your (recently) expensive dairy products or your carefully prepared food go bad.</p>

<p>This article points out that just because something has a date printed on it doesn't mean you have to throw it out:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/food-drink/how-we-became-the-throwaway-generation-1219301.html">http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/food-drink/how-we-became-the-throwaway-generation-1219301.html</a></p>

<p>Learn the Trick has step-by-step instructions for meal-planning based on what you have:</p>

<p><a href="http://learnthetrick.com/archives/5">http://learnthetrick.com/archives/5</a></p>

<p>Personally, I'm not a major menu planner because I like the serendipity of using what I found on special. Here's something I really like: Cookie Magazine each month has a graphic page that starts with: &quot;If you have ...&quot; For example, if you have an eggplant, and stale bread, do this and that, et viola, you have eggplant cutlets. If you have an eggplant and tomato sauce... </p>

<p>Readers -- I know you're out there. Can you share your strategies, successes and failures when it comes to using what you have and avoiding food waste?</p>

I've been hitting Target a lot less since I started CVSing, but when I do, I make sure to check the Clearance items on the endcaps. Last time, I came across some of those easy-to-remove wall decals marked down to about $4.60.</p>

<p>The ones we chose were tropical fish. Nutmeg and I had a ball decorating our upstairs bathroom with them. They're the perfect thing for a room that needs work but isn't going to get that work right away. Cheap, quick and fully reversible, they're the ultimate low-commitment decor &quot;investment.&quot;</p>

<p>Best of all, you can let little kids stick them up with abandon, because if they accidentally (or on purpose) get them all wrinkled, upside down or whatnot, it can easily be fixed.</p>

<p>I didn't love all my daughter's design choices, like squeezing a full sheet worth of stickers onto the door of the small vanity. But this is our upstairs bathroom, rarely seen by outsiders, and (we hope) to be completely gutted later this year. So what the hell? Create the world's most cramped aquarium on the vanity door.</p><br /><p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=1066,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://shopliftingwithpermission.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/05/02/vanity.jpg"><img width="100" height="133" border="0" src="http://shopliftingwithpermission.typepad.com/blog/images/2008/05/02/vanity.jpg" title="Vanity" alt="Vanity" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>
</p>



<p>We also used stickers of this kind to personalize the girls' bedroom when we moved in last year. The room was already decorated for a little girl, very nicely, but Nutmeg wanted butterflies. And butterflies she got.</p>

<p>This week I earned $93.78ECBs! I spent $118.92 in cash ($9.36) and ECBs ($109.56 ), so this was not a moneymaking week for me. However, I brought home a number of necessary purchases, including a birthday gift for a party my daughter is attending this weekend, all our milk for the week, snacks and soda for my husband's card party, and mother's day gifts. All that is worth way more than the $25 I spent (if you call using ECBs &quot;spending&quot;), not to mention the $100+ in other merchandise I bought because they were paying ECBs but we will actually use, such as maxi pads, Aveeno babywash, razors, Neutrogena makeup and more. Also, I was building up a lot of ECBs, and what is the point of constantly building them without ever spending down the pile?</p>

<p>Oh yeah, and I sent away for $16 in rebates, and sold about $7 worth of products purchased this week at today's rummage sale. Which would bring me pretty close to break even for the week.</p>

<p>I'm stunned not only by how much I rang up but also the fact that I made 13 transactions. Almost all of them on separate visits.&nbsp; I would say I will cut back on that this coming week but with this May monthly deals book sitting on my coffee table and another little incentive, I will be over there more than ever this week.</p>

<p>I put all my transactions at the bottom if you have the patience to look at that many numbers. But before that, I want to let you in on a secret I discovered this week: Free photo coupons.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the week, Money Saving Mom <a href="http://www.moneysavingmom.com/2008/04/hot-fresh-315-cvs-coupon.html">announced</a> that there were new $3/$15 coupons available if you sign up for a free trial <a href="http://thewashingtonpost.newspaperdirect.com/epaper/viewer.aspx">here</a>. Along with the $3/$15 coupon was a coupon for 10 free prints. I nearly threw those away, since I knew you can get <a href="http://forums.slickdeals.net/showthread.php?sduid=0&amp;t=546784">a lot of CVS prints for free</a> already.</p>

<p>However, when I noticed that photo albums were buy 1, get 1 half-off this week, I decided to put together albums for my mother and MIL for next week's holiday. So I used one of the 10-print coupons and figured I would use as many as I had time for before next Sunday.</p>

<p>Only when my purchase rang up did I realize how valuable these coupons are, as FILLERS. Every time you use the coupon for 10 prints, it adds between $2.50 and $2.90 to your purchase, depending on how much your store charges. My local store has charged various amounts at different times. At any rate, using this coupon means you need only spend $12.50 to use the $3/$15 coupon.</p>

<p>With all the freebies in the <a href="http://www.fatwallet.com/forums/topic.php?catid=18&amp;threadid=822701">May booklet</a>, you should be able to get a lot of ECBs for very little outlay in this manner. Not to mention a lot of free prints!</p>

<p>We stayed within the $80 budget for grocery shopping this week, with no major deals. This coming week is going to be another challenge, though, because Epu hit Binney's Beverage Depot in advance of his card party, going on as I type this. He got some of that fancy Sprecher beer we tasted on our brewery tour last month, so with a couple of bottles of vino, we were out $50, leaving $30 for food.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I was able to procure the snacks for the card party free at CVS. And the cards.</p>

<p>I'll save my week's CVS haul for my next post. For now, let me report on the rummage sale we participated in this morning. We made about $85 and spent around $10. We had fun, enjoyed the nice glow of seeing stuff that was cluttering our basement go to people who could really use it, and got better aquainted with another family whose daughter is in Nutmeg's preschool.</p>

<p>So all in all I'm glad we did it, even though if I add up the hours we spent sorting out stuff and getting it over there, plus the hours Epu spent reformatting two computers (which didn't even sell), plus the three hours working the sale, we probably made about $7.50 an hour each, i.e., it was not financially worth our time.</p>

<p>Our large items, which were priced very well, went right away, in fact they all went to the same woman who had recently gotten a new apartment. My CVS leftovers, priced at $1 each, also went well. All the video games went. The rest of the junk went s-l-o-w-l-y or not at all. So I probably brought in $50 within an hour and the other $35 over the next two hours.</p>

<p>What would I do differently? <br />1) Dispose of all adult clothes at Salvation Army. We sold maybe one item of clothing, for a quarter. True, we didn't have a hanging rack which might have helped.<br />2) Same with all miscellaneous small junk, unless I put it on Freecycle. The effort of looking at each extra spatula and other old junk, sorting it by price, and sitting there waiting for it to sell is not worth the pennies that this stuff brought in.<br />3) Only bring to the rummage sale the large, valuable items such as our old working vacuum cleaner and the relatively new Kenmore microwave oven, and the medium things like the video games, new-in-package sheets and board game, and CVS stuff. It'll go within a few hours and make it worth your while.<br />4) If you really want to get a fair price, of course, sell the bigger stuff online, not on the street.</p>

</p>
<p>More than the $85 I made, I was pleased with the $10 I spent. One of the other moms from Nutmeg's preschool sold us her daughter's old Radio Flyer <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=radio%20flyer%20classic%20tricycle&amp;tag=myfufufa-20&amp;index=blended&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">trike</a><img height="1" width="1" border="0" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=myfufufa-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" />, for THREE DOLLARS. OK, Pebbles already has a Kettrike, also used. But this tricycle is so, so cute. I really don't know why my friend priced it like that, since she told me herself they sell for $40. I found <a href="http://chicago.craigslist.org/nwc/bab/657122322.html">one on Craigslist for $25</a>.</p>
<p>



I also got a portable file cabinet with a little organizer tray on top for $1. This will be -- yes -- my new coupon center. The top tray is great for stowing coupons I plan to use in the current week or month, and paper clips.</p>

<p>I have been somewhat remiss in hopping on those monthly deals released earlier this week, and now I am hoping that some will still be there when I hit my CVS tomorrow. I plan to mostly ignore the weekly deals this week, except for the Kiss or Broadway nail stuff, which would be both a moneymaker and a good filler, the Garnier 100% dye, and possibly, possibly some Pampers.</p>

<p>These are some monthly deal scenarios that I'd like to try over the next couple of days. Each one uses the <a href="http://shopliftingwithpermission.typepad.com/blog/2008/05/shopping-saturd.html">free photo coupon</a>, because I am working up to getting 200 prints for my Mother's Day gifts. So far I have about 40. I also have a favorite new filler: 35-cent oatmeal cream pies! I have loved those things since I was a kid.</p>

<p>If I can pull off these 3 transactions, I'll make a profit of&nbsp; more than $16ECBs with very little out of pocket. I'll also rack up 30 more photos for mother's day. As for the other stuff, the deodorant, toothpaste and Orapik will go to the homeless shelter, the Dawn and cream pies are for me, and the Tums are for Grandma. As for the Claritin, who wants it, since <a href="http://shopliftingwithpermission.typepad.com/blog/2008/04/wasted-wednes-1.html">it's useless</a>?</p>

Ahh. I've loved the loratadine deals! First Alavert, now CVS brand. It's the only kind of antihistamine my husband can take for his job, and I've stocked him up until he runs out of allergies!!

<p>Yesterday instead of preparing dinner I spent the afternoon trying to dig up a bush in my front yard. It's still out there, hanging on by one very tough root.</p>

<p>So when the girls and I got home from swimming lessons at 6 p.m., I was rummaging through leftovers and Jane Brody's Good Food Book. I had some mashed potatoes and cole slaw, and enthusiasm for the cole slaw had been waning chez Shoplifing.</p>

<p>Jane Brody, oh oracle of dinner, told me: Make <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/50540">colcannon</a>! And it was good.</p>

<p>I also defrosted some mystery bean soup from the freezer, which turned out to have tiny bits of some kind of meat in it. But that was totally not on purpose.</p>

<p>Tonight, now. My plan last night was to start some split peas in the slow cooker this morning, then add onions and celery after grocery shopping this afternoon. Did I remember that plan this morning? Nope. So, um, not sure what we're having.</p>

<p>But since we spent most of our grocery money on fancy beer this week, I probably won't be buying any meat today. I have a frozen chicken defrosting in the fridge. And I will be buying <a href="http://www.moneysavingmom.com/2008/05/speed-linking-superfresh-coop-advantage.html">10 boxes of cereal</a> for $5 after coupons, but I think we'll give most of them to the <a href="http://www.helpstampouthunger.com/">letter carrier food drive</a> Saturday.</p>

BODY:
<p>Do you remember that episode of Seinfeld where he proposed a statue of limitations on greeting cards? Like, how long must a decent person display a folded piece of paper before dropping it into the trash?</p>

<p>That kind of sums up the way I feel about most greeting cards. I appreciate the thought involved in sending them, or attaching them to a gift, but I usually cannot wait to clear away the clutter and drop them into the recycle bin. Which makes me feel a little bit guilty, knowing that the sender sent $3 or more on the card. My dad recently picked out a card without checking the price -- and was stunned when it rang up as SEVEN DOLLARS.</p>

<p>So I'm on greeting card moratorium, and I wish I could get others to join in if only to lessen my guilt about not buying them greeting cards. There are a few occasions that I feel still warrant a card -- a wedding, a death in the family, a serious illness. Other than that, you might get a gift from me, you might get a phone call (note to self: today is Grandma and Grandpa's anniversary, call them!), you might even get a heartfelt note.</p>

<p>But you are not getting up to $7 worth of folded card stock with preprinted sentiments.</p>

<p>There are times when I would suggest skipping greeting cards even if they were free. A biggie, for me, is children's birthday parties. When a kid receives a big pile of presents and the relatives all want the kid/mom to open them publicly, opening all those greeting cards, and smiling appropriately at the sentiments expressed, really slows down the proceedings. The kids just want to get to the presents. The partygoers just want to see their gift open so they can go home or get back to watching the game or have another cup of coffee.</p>

<p>These are the ideas we have used to avoid buying greeting cards. Feel free to add your own ideas in the comments section:</p>

<p>1) Homemade or purchased gift tags. A tag often costs around 50 cents and fulfills the same purpose as a card taped to a present: identifying who it came from. Making your own tag out of odds and ends is generally free. Also, I recently picked up some place cards on clearance at Target that will make cute gift tags. Even better, use a little extra gift or decoration to label the gift -- we recently found an inexpensive notepad with the birthday girl's initial and wrote her name on that and taped it to the gift.</p>

<p>2) Have the kids make a card. Nutmeg has a big bin of old greeting cards, stickers, paper and other scraps. With some help, she can paste together a card that has any relative going, &quot;aww.&quot; She received a lot of hand-drawn cards from her guests at her recent birthday, too, and we all enjoyed them more than mass-produced ones.</p>

<p>3) Put pen to paper. You know, Miss Manners does not mandate the sending of greeting cards, nor does Emily Post. Far from it: A note on paper is actually more appropriate, Miss Manners says.</p>

<p>I still send my Christmas cards, which I feel fulfill the important purpose of maintaining our connection with far-flung friends. But I would never send out a mass-produced Xmas card with only my signature without including any updates or family pictures. What is the point?</p>

You know, one of my friend's moms does the most amazing thing with used greeting cards---she cuts up small pieces of them and creates mosaic frames as wedding gifts.  A few years after our wedding, I remember bellyaching "what on earth do you do with these cards...you can't just throw your wedding cards away, right?"  My friend immediately asked me to load up those cards and get them to his mom for some art-making.

Now, I must disclose, my friend is a professional artist, his father is a professional artist, and his mother, the "greeting card mosaic maker" is also an artist in her own right.  The frames she creates are intricate and absolutely stunning, usually containing some bits of color and texture mixed in with painstakingly cut graphics or text.  They typically end up housing a copy of the couples' invitation and a photo from the wedding, and they always seem to reflect the individual style of the bride and groom (no matter how cheesy the original cards from which they are made are).

While I don't think a toddler must create intricate mosaics, the idea that you propose with old cards, stickers, etc. for little ones to make new cards could easily be used for a wide array of frames, journal covers, etc., for wide-eyed grandparents ready for an "awhhh" gift from one of their darlings.

Yesterday the girls and I hit Jewel with a fitsful of coupons to participate in the 10 cereals for $10 deal. We ended up with 6 cerealsl, 2 boxes of granola bars and 2 boxes of fruit snacks for $6.25. Would have been better, but I found out at the checkout that my Jewel does not accept Internet coupons! So the fruit snacks and one of the granola bars were the full price of one dollar each. </p>

<p>I used two $1/2 cereal coupons, one $1/3 cereal coupon, and one $0.75/1 Chex coupon, as well as one $0.50/1 granola bar coupon.</p>

<p>I'm not even taking that out of our grocery budget, because we are donating 10 boxes of cereal to the <a href="http://www.nalc.org/commun/foodrive/index.html">Letter Carriers food drive</a> this weekend. We're keeping the granola bars and fruit snacks and replacing them with some of the extra cereal I have sitting around from the last Dominick's deal.</p>

<p>My parents, former (Dad) and current (Mom) leaders of the National Association of Letter Carriers and its Auxiliary, are in town and also wanted to pick up some food for the drive. I sent them over to Jewel with the $2/5 cereal coupon I got at the register when I bought all that stuff. And five $1/2 coupons. If they are allowed to use all of them, they should be able to get 10 boxes of cereal for $3.</p>

<p>Eh?</p>

<p>They also wanted to go to CVS, so I gave them a $5/$25 coupon and $20ECBs that are actually in my mother's name, since I use her account a lot to buy ECB-generating stuff. And of course the $3/$15 coupon. And strict instructions to spend at least $28 and get it all free. Mom was psyched. Let's see if they can pull it off.</p>

I think it's totally cool that your mom is excited about the Jewel and CVS trips.  My mom thinks it's neat but has her preferred shopping locations so it's hard to talk her into hitting other places for the deals!

Tell your mom kudos for raising a thrifty-wise daughter!

<p>For my kids, Christmas and both their birthdays come in a span of five months. Since we just celebrated the second birthday, this time with a party for the whole preschool class, we are overrun with new toys here. </p>

<p>So I'm really glad that we had the idea this year to give Nutmeg, the 4-year-old, tickets to a children's theater production for her birthday. </p>

<p>The show was &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; and tickets were only about $9. I arranged a sitter for the baby and took Nutmeg yesterday. I have never seen her so rapt and enthralled in anything. The whole experience was as much a treat for me as it was for her, but instead of watching the play, I watched her face the whole time.</p>

<p>Besides the actual show, which she loved, Nutmeg got the gift of a
morning alone with Mom, something rare now that her baby sister is in
the family.</p>

<p>When the show was over, Nutmeg and I agreed that we would go see a show every year as a birthday present. Now, over the years I'm sure we will go to some shows that cost as much or more as we would have spent on a material gift. But we won't have to deal with the additional clutter of yet another toy in the house. </p>

<p>Besdies, there will be shows and events we want to take the kids to over the years, and knowing that the tickets double as a birthday gift will make the cost seem less of a burden.</p>

<p>Posting here may be sparse this weekend as we're traveling for Mother's Day, but I'll post about my week's shopping if I can.</p>

<p>This is another recipe from &quot;Jane Brody's Good Food Book&quot; but I can't find it online. Basically you saute a bunch of veggies, pour in a couple cans of tomatoes, simmer it for 20 minutes, make mashed potatoes, put the filling in a casserole dish and top with mashed potatoes. And then with shredded cheese. You are supposed to season it with soy sauce but since Nutmeg is allergic to that I put in some chicken broth (heh, we're not vegetarians) and some rice wine vinegar. I think it will be delicious and Nutmeg had a good time helping me wash all those vegetables.</p>

<p>Jane Brody's recipe gave me so much filling that I froze two bags of it after filling a 9x12 lasagna dish.</p>

<p>This should also yield leftovers for some good lunches this week.</p>

<p>We're a far cry from one of those couples who are committing &quot;<a href="http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/CollegeAndFamily/LoveAndMoney/FinancialInfidelityIsRampant.aspx">financial infidelity</a>&quot; on one another by wantonly racking up credit card debt. Still, it's a continual source of conflict in our house: I save our resources while Epu wastes them.</p>

<p>Oh, he's a wonderful husband. He even gets up in the morning and feeds the girls breakfast while I catch a few extra winks. </p>

<p>Which is what led me to today's discovery of WASTING MILK. It was like finding a decapitated gopher on your doorstep, except we don't have a cat, so it was a bowl filled NEARLY TO THE RIM with milk, with a few bits of cereal floating in it.</p>

<p>This was my daughter's cereal bowl after it was finished.</p>

<p>I was wondering why we seemed to be going through so much milk since I got all that cheap and free cereal. I didn't really think an ounce or two on cereal in the morning would make me have to buy a new gallon every couple of days.</p>

<p>Now I understand. In my husband's bizarre algebra, 8 oz. of cereal require at least 8 oz. of milk. Heck, make it 10! Never mind that about 1/2 an oz. is consumed with the cereal and the remaining 9.5 oz. go down the kitchen sink.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I was up early enough to catch my daughter finishing up her cereal. She wanted me to dump the milk so she could have a second helping of Lucky Charms, this time dry.</p>

<p>I made her drink the milk&nbsp; before she could have seconds. OK, she never actually ate the second bowl, and after that sat around in her sticky milky bowl all day I ended up tossing it. But it's a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>I'm going to have a talk with Epu about the cereal milk issue, but I know it won't go anywhere. Is it possible to change a grown person's habits? Certainly I have been mentioning it to him EVERY TIME he leaves a light on for the last 10 years, and that only serves to make him grumpy and defensive. </p>

<p>Honestly, I can tell EVERY TIME he has been in our basement, because I will notice through the heating vents that the lights are on down there. I'll say, What were you downstairs for? He'll say, I had to get some drywall screws. Yesterday. And how did you know?</p>

<p>His arguments: Since he put in ecological bulbs, they take so little power it doesn't matter. Or, I'm planning on going back down there soon.</p>

<p>I have never understood why it is so hard to flip a simple wall switch as you walk out of the basement. But I guess he grew up never turning off lights (walk into his parents' house on any given midnight and you'll find half the house lit up) and it's too late for him.</p>

<p>Should I give up? Does your spouse have wasteful habits that peeve you? Have you ever successfully changed even one of them?</p>

<p>Do tell.</p>

My husband goes through paper towel like I've never seen. Everywhere I go there will be a wet wadded up paper towel he's used for something. I tried to get him to switch to dish rags, but to no avail. We're back to paper towel.

Funny you should say that! The other day my daughter spilled a cup of water. My husband grabbed a roll of paper towels and used the side of it to sop up the water. As if it were a sponge.

I was like, wtf???? I mean, you clean up plain water with a cloth towel, you don't even have to wash it. It's water! And he used the whole roll of paper towels.

Or he would have, but of course I just let it dry out and continued using the roll sparingly as normal.

Mine is a paper towel waster, big time. He was gone for 2 weeks recently, me and 3 kids used 1 roll in that time. Since he has been home, he averages 2 a week! I could go on and on. He'll get a can of Coke, drink half of it, then go get another. His excuse, it's warm. Put it in a cup with some stupid ice! He'll use a bar of soap once or twice then open a new one. I can go on and on about his not so frugal ways.

<p>When I saw the coupons for $2 off Ken's Steak House <a href="http://www.kensfoods.com/kf/products/productBrowse.servlet;jsessionid=aktE9sow_Mx7">salad dressings</a> and <a href="http://www.kensfoods.com/kf/products/productView.servlet;jsessionid=aktE9sow_Mx7?consumerProductId=65&amp;productCategoryId=5&amp;productFlavorId=">salad sprays</a> in recent newspaper inserts, I clipped them out right away. I thought, It's not uncommon to see salad dressing on sale for $2 each, so I bet I could get these free one of these days.</p>

<p>One of these days is today, and you can get them too if you have your coupons and you shop at Jewel (or possibly other <a href="http://www.supervalu.com/sv-webapp/index.jsp">Supervalu</a> stores.</p>

<p>Here's what we got:</p>

<p>Hmm, I'm having trouble posting photos today. Imagine you are seeing here two bottles of ranch, one french, one honey mustard and one raspberry vinagrette. And then four bottles of salad spray in similar flavors.</p>

<p> and I am really looking forward to a summer of salads. I tossed out a couple of old bottles of dressing that had been in our fridge since -- well, I think we moved them from the fridge in our old apartment last year to here.</p>

<p>It was a great shopping trip all around today: I participated in <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/cheap-charity-is-sweet-charity">this promotion</a> and got 20 cans of tomatoes and ravioli, two mega staples at our house, for 50 cents each. Then there was a very full clearance cart that yielded 34-cent ice cream topping (after coupons, which they did let me use), couple jars of crushed garlic, and a 4-pack of UHT treated organic chocolate milk, the packaging slightly dog-eared but the milk before its expiration date. That was $1.99.</p>

<p>AND even besides the salad dressing coupons, I used lots -- a $1 coupon for Jewel's new in-house organic brand, which I used on lettuce, and how often do you get to use a coupon for fresh produce? Three 50-cent coupons on whole wheat pasta, making it 75 cents for a 13.5-oz. box. 55 cents of sale-priced worstershire sauce.</p>

<p>This makes me feel better about a possible frugal flop: Yesterday I bought a cheap (98-cent-a-pound) pork roast at a small grocery I'd never visited before. Last night I opened the package and it smelled kind of rank. It's been in the slow cooker all day, and I'm nervous. I Googled it and got all kinds of answers ranging from &quot;all pork stinks&quot; to &quot;if it smells bad, it <em>is </em>bad.&quot;</p>

BODY:
<p>Lately I have picked up several pages of coupons from magazines. Some of the magazines I subscribe to (either cheap or free, of course), some I found at the doctor's office and at the gym, and, in the case of <a href="http://www.fatwallet.com/forums/hot-deals/822701/">All You</a>, we actually stopped at Wal-Mart and bought six copies just for the coupons.*</p>

<p>Here are the other magazines that have CVS-able coupons in their April or May issues:</p>

<p>Wonder Time (April, including $1 off Glade which makes it free this week at CVS)<br />Parents (May, I think. I got it at the gym. Same coupons as above.)<br />Good Housekeeping (a page of CVS coupons, which can be stacked with manufacturers' coupons!)</p>

<p>In the May issue of All You, besides the free deodorant coupon which has been widely reported, there are $1.50 off Colgate coupons which make a moneymaker out of this week's &quot;<a href="http://www.moneysavingmom.com/2008/05/cvs-deals-for-week-of-may-11-17.html">buy Colgate @ $2.99, get $2ECB</a>&quot; offer. And $1 off Hershey's Bliss coupons, which I have been combining with the bogo coupons from recent Sunday inserts to make the <a href="http://www.fatwallet.com/forums/hot-deals/828619/">Hershey deal</a> into a moneymaker (Buy 2 Hershey's Bliss with two $1/1 coupons and one bogo coupon, then throw in one 99-cent big bar (good for summer campfire s'mores) and an under-the-counter sized bar for 50 cents. That should ring up to around $10.10 depending on the cost of the Bliss bags at your store. After the coupons, you pay about $4, get $5ECB.)</p>

<p>By the way, do you rip coupons out of magazines you find in public places? I sure do. Oh, they're usually their own insert so no text pages are lost from the magazine. Still, I certainly feel self-conscious about it and I hope no one ever yells at me for it. I'm sure a woman noticed me pulling the page out of Good Housekeeping today at the gym.</p>

<p>* We NEVER shop at Wal-Mart, but I was able to get this magazines without *technically* giving the company more than $1. My husband had a gift card sitting on his dresser from two years ago when he'd gotten it as a birthday gift. $10. I called the hotline and it is still worth $10 -- unlike many companies Wal-Mart didn't deduct any of the balance for non-use. So we stopped at a Wal-Mart during our Mother's Day drive to Milwaukee, I grabbed six All You's at the register, it rang up to $11-something, and I paid a dollar and change plus the gift card. Each magazine has at least $7.50 worth of coupons that I will redeem THIS MONTH at CVS, and others that I'm sure I will use down the road. What a great magazine for coupons (and an icky one for content)!</p>

Unfortunately, I couldn't find any survey in any of my copies.

Okay, I have to admit something.  I can't figure out your coupon math.  I  know, it sounds simple-as-pie, and I'm no dummy, but I really don't get how you are figuring out these combinations of things, then leaving only "really" paying $1.  It seems extremely complicated, but that may be because I haven't practiced.

There, I said it.  Your friend is intimidated by coupon math.  Sorry. :(

Usually, the secret is the CVS Extra Bucks. Which is kind of a drag if you don't have a CVS nearby like we do :-(

With the Hershey's stuff that I mentioned, anyone could get 2 bags of fancy chocolate worth $8+ for $2, but only if your store will accept 3 coupons on 2 items like my CVS will. In fact, I think it might be only the really nice checker at my CVS who does this. One buy one, get one free coupon, which takes off $4, and two $1 off coupons, for a total of $6 off the $8 purchase = you pay $2.
