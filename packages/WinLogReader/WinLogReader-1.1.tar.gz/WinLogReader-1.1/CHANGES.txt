* Fixed a bug in the verification of the entry header.
    - It occured when it got passed a dict whitout the key 'RecordLength'.
* Added support for further list()-methods. Only those that I saw fit for this module.
    - Added following methods:
        __getitem__()
        __getslice__()
        __iter__()
        __reversed__()
        reverse()
        count()
* Code cleanup in most methods regarding which list to display.
* Added support to only get relevant entries from each event. This is now the default.
   To get a full dump add True as a second argument when calling the class.
    - e.g.: test.WinLogReader.WinLogReader('AppEvent.Evt',True)
