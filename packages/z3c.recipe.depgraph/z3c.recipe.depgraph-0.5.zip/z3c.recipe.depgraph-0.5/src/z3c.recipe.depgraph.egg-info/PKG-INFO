        ===================
        
        This buildout recipe generates dependency graphs for packages.
        
        Options
        -------
        
        eggs
        The eggs for which graphs are generated. All dependencies of the eggs are
        automatically included.
        
        exclude
        A list of eggs which should be excluded from the graph processing.
        
        re-exclude
        A list of eggs' regular expressions which should be excluded.
        
        dead-ends
        A list of eggs which dependencies should be excluded.
        
        re-dead-ends
        A list of eggs' regular expressions which dependencies should be excluded.
        
        extras
        A boolean determining if extra requirements should be included. Defaults
        to False.
        
        package-map
        An buildout section containing a mapping of distribution names to package
        names.
        
        variants
        A whitespace separated list of variants of graphs to create. The available
        options are::
        
        base - The basic full graphs.
        tred - The transitive reduction of the graphs.
        scc - Extracts graphs of strongly connected components.
        
        formats
        A whitespace separated list of output-formats to create. Defaults to svg.
        Please consult the manpages for the dot-command or visit the graphviz-website
        for a full list_. Most commonly used options are::
        
        svg - Scalable Vector Graphics
        png - Portable Network Graphics
        gif - Graphics Interchange Format

        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.5 (2009-12-21)
        ----------------
        
        - Do not break if the ``eggs`` option in the buildout file contains extras.
        
        0.4 (2009-10-04)
        ----------------
        
        - Added additional ``formats`` option, to control in which file formats the
        output is generated.
        
        - Added additional ``re-exclude``, ``dead-ends`` and ``re-dead-ends`` options,
        to control used eggs more precisely.
        
        - Added additional ``strict`` option, if you want graphs only for eggs in eggs
        option.
        
        0.3 (2009-07-23)
        ----------------
        
        - Allow to pass in a ``package-map`` manually, mapping distribution names
        to different package names.
        
        - Added additional ``extras`` option, to control wether or not extra
        dependencies (like test requirements) should be included.
        
        - Corrected distribution name discovery to preserve case.
        
        0.2 (2009-05-24)
        ----------------
        
        - Do not use ``-d`` option for degenerate nodes for sccmap, as this
        creates way too much extra information.
        
        0.1 (2009-04-26)
        ----------------
        
        - Initial implementation.
