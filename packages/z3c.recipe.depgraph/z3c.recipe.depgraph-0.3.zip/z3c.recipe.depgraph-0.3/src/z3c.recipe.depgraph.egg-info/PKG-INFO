Description: z3c.recipe.depgraph
        ===================
        
        This buildout recipe generates dependency graphs for packages.
        
        Options
        -------
        
        eggs
        The eggs for which graphs are generated. All dependencies of the eggs are
        automatically included.
        
        exclude
        A list of eggs which should be excluded from the graph processing.
        
        extras
        A boolean determining if extra requirements should be included. Defaults
        to False.
        
        package-map
        An buildout section containing a mapping of distribution names to package
        names.
        
        variants
        A whitespace separated list of variants of graphs to create. The available
        options are:
        
        base - The basic full graphs.
        tred - The transitive reduction of the graphs.
        scc - Extracts graphs of strongly connected components.
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.3 (2009-07-23)
        ----------------
        
        - Allow to pass in a ``package-map`` manually, mapping distribution names
        to different package names.
        
        - Added additional ``extras`` option, to control wether or not extra
        dependencies (like test requirements) should be included.
        
        - Corrected distribution name discovery to preserve case.
        
        0.2 (2009-05-24)
        ----------------
        
        - Do not use ``-d`` option for degenerate nodes for sccmap, as this
        creates way too much extra information.
        
        0.1 (2009-04-26)
        ----------------
        
        - Initial implementation.
