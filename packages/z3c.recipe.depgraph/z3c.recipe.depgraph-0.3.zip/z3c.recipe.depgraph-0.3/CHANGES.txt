Changelog
=========

0.3 (2009-07-23)
----------------

- Allow to pass in a ``package-map`` manually, mapping distribution names
  to different package names.

- Added additional ``extras`` option, to control wether or not extra
  dependencies (like test requirements) should be included.

- Corrected distribution name discovery to preserve case.

0.2 (2009-05-24)
----------------

- Do not use ``-d`` option for degenerate nodes for sccmap, as this
  creates way too much extra information.

0.1 (2009-04-26)
----------------

- Initial implementation.
