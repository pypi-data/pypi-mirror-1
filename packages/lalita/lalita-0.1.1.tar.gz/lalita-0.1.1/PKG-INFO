        ==============================
        Welcome to the lalita project!
        ==============================
        
        lalita is yet another IRC bot, one where new functionality is simple to
        create just adding easy-to-write plugins.
        
        lalita is written with some goals in mind:
        
        - Twisted! (we don't like threads)
        
        - Pluggable: easy to implement new functionalities
        
        - Have fun: yes, it's Python
        
        All the code in lalita is licensed under GNU GPL v3. See LICENSE.txt for
        further info.
        
        The project page is::
        
        https://edge.launchpad.net/lalita
        
        To run the bot, create a config file (you can use the sample lalita.cfg.sample)
        as a guideline, and run::
        
        ircbot.py -c <configfile> <server>
        
        There're a lot of test cases! You can try them running "nosetests" (you
        need to have Nose installed).
        
        To create a plugin, check the plugins/example.py one, and use it as a start.
        
        We don't have a mail list for the project, but you can check in #pyar on
        Freenode, most of developers are around there.
        
        Enjoy it!
        
        
        Manhole
        =======
        
        The --manhole[-*] options enable a manhole ssh server the provides an
        interactive interpreter to poke the bot instance(s).
        
        Example:
        
        Start the bot with "--manhole" option::
        
        $ python ircbot.py --manhole
        
        From another terminal, connect to the machine where the bot is running,
        port 2222::
        
        $ ssh admin@localhost -p 2222
        admin@localhost's password: admin
        
        This will drop you in a python shell::
        
        >>> bot = servers['<server name>']
        # bot is a IrcBot instance
        >>> bot.say('<channel>', 'something')
        
        WARNING: this is a potential security hole if the port 2222 (or the one you
        configure with --manhole-port) is accesible from internet or other machines.
        
        
        How to run lalita without installing
        ====================================
        
        From the top-level directory run::
        
        python lalita/ircbot.py
        
        For example, setting logs in debug mode, pointing to the sample
        configuration, and choosing a server in localhost::
        
        python lalita/ircbot.py -o DEBUG lalita.cfg.sample localhost
