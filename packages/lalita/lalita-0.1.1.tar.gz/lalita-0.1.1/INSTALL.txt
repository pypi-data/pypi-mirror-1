QUICK HOWTO
===========

This package has a setuptools compatible setup.py file.
If all requirements are met, just follow the usual steps, e.g.::

    python setup.py install -- to install it into the site-packages folder

Alternatively, you can run the bot directly from the directory where you get it.

Just a couple of things:

 * Depends on twisted (more specificaly, twisted words) and python-pysqlite2.

 * Sqlite3 has to be installed (specifically its headers).

 * url.Url plugin depends on Beautiful Soup v3.1.0.1 or similar (just check that
   XHTML_ENTITIES exist), python-magic and python-chardet (and twisted web, just
   in case you installed a partial twisted).
