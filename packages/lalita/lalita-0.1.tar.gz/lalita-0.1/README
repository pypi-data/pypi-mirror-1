Welcome to the lalita project!

lalita is yet another IRC bot, one where new functionality is simple to 
create just adding easy-to-write plugins.

lalita is written with some goals in mind:

- Twisted! (we don't like threads)

- Pluggable: easy to implement new functionalities

- Have fun: yes, it's Python

All the code in lalita is licensed under GNU GPL v3. See LICENSE.txt for 
further info.

The project page is

  https://edge.launchpad.net/lalita

To run the bot, create a config file (you can use the sample lalita.cfg.sample)
as a guideline, and run

ircbot.py -c <configfile> <server>

There're a lot of test cases! You can try them running "nosetests" (you 
need to have Nose installed).

To create a plugin, check the plugins/example.py one, and use it as a start.

We don't have a mail list for the project, but you can check in #pyar on 
Freenode, most of developers are around there.

Enjoy it!
