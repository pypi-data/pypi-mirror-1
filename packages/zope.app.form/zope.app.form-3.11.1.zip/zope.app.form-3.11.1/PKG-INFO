Description: This package provides a form and widget framework for Zope 3. It also
        implements a few high-level ZCML directives for declaring forms. More advanced
        alternatives are implemented in ``zope.formlib`` and ``z3c.form``.
        
        
        Detailed documentation:
        
        
        ===============
        Browser Widgets
        ===============
        
        .. contents::
        
        This directory contains widgets: views on bound schema fields.  Many of these
        are straightforward.  For instance, see the `TextWidget` in textwidgets.py,
        which is a subclass of BrowserWidget in widget.py.  It is registered as an
        `IBrowserRequest` view of an `ITextLine` schema field, providing the
        `IInputWidget` interface::
        
        <view
        type="zope.publisher.interfaces.browser.IBrowserRequest"
        for="zope.schema.interfaces.ITextLine"
        provides="zope.app.form.interfaces.IInputWidget"
        factory=".TextWidget"
        permission="zope.Public"
        />
        
        The widget then receives the field and the request as arguments to the factory
        (i.e., the `TextWidget` class).
        
        Some widgets in Zope 3 extend this pattern.  This extension is configurable:
        simply do not load the zope/app/form/browser/configure.zcml file if you do not
        wish to participate in the extension.  The widget registration is extended for
        `Choice` fields and for the `collection` fields.
        
        Default Choice Field Widget Registration and Lookup
        ===================================================
        
        As described above, all field widgets are obtained by looking up a browser
        `IInputWidget` or `IDisplayWidget` view for the field object.  For `Choice`
        fields, the default registered widget defers all of its behavior to the result
        of another lookup: a browser widget view for the field *and* the Choice field's
        vocabulary.
        
        This allows registration of Choice widgets that differ on the basis of the
        vocabulary type.  For example, a widget for a vocabulary of images might have
        a significantly different user interface than a widget for a vocabulary of
        words.  A dynamic vocabulary might implement `IIterableVocabulary` if its
        contents are below a certain length, but not implement the marker "iterable"
        interface if the number of possible values is above the threshhold.
        
        This also means that choice widget factories are called with with an additional
        argument.  Rather than being called with the field and the request as
        arguments, choice widgets receive the field, vocabulary, and request as
        arguments.
        
        Some `Choice` widgets may also need to provide a query interface,
        particularly if the vocabulary is too big to iterate over.  The vocabulary
        may provide a query which implements an interface appropriate for that
        vocabulary.  You then can register a query view -- a view registered for the
        query interface and the field interface -- that implements
        `zope.app.forms.browser.interfaces.IVocabularyQueryView`.
        
        Default Collection Field Widget Registration and Lookup
        =======================================================
        
        The default configured lookup for collection fields -- List, Tuple, and Set, for
        instance -- begins with the usual lookup for a browser widget view for the
        field object.  This widget defers its display to the result of another lookup:
        a browser widget view registered for the field and the field's `value_type`
        (the type of the contained values).  This allows registrations for collection
        widgets that differ on the basis of the members -- a widget for entering a list
        of text strings might differ significantly from a widget for entering a list of
        dates...or even a list of choices, as discussed below.
        
        This registration pattern has three implications that should be highlighted.
        
        * First, collection fields that do not specify a `value_type` probably cannot
        have a reasonable widget.
        
        * Second, collection widgets that wish to be the default widget for a
        collection with any `value_type` should be registered for the collection
        field and a generic value_type: the `IField` interface.  Do  not register the
        generic widget for the collection field only or you will break the lookup
        behavior as described here.
        
        * Third, like choice widget factories, sequence widget factories (classes or
        functions) take three arguments.  Typical sequence widgets receive the
        field, the `value_type`, and the request as arguments.
        
        Collections of Choices
        ----------------------
        
        If a collection field's `value_type` is a `Choice` field, the second widget
        again defers its behavior, this time to a third lookup based on the collection
        field and the choice's vocabulary.  This means that a widget for a list of
        large image choices can be different than a widget for a list of small image
        choices (with a different vocabulary interface), different from a widget for a
        list of keyword choices, and different from a set of keyword choices.
        
        Some advanced applications may wish to do a further lookup on the basis of the
        unique attribute of the collection field--perhaps looking up a named view with
        a "unique" or "lenient" token depending on the field's value, but this is not
        enabled in the default Zope 3 configuration.
        
        Registering Widgets for a New Collection Field Type
        ---------------------------------------------------
        
        Because of this lookup pattern, basic widget registrations for new field types
        must follow a recipe.  For example, a developer may introduce a new Bag field
        type for simple shopping cart functionality and wishes to add widgets for it
        within the default Zope 3 collection widget registration.  The bag widgets
        should be registered something like this.
        
        The only hard requirement is that the developer must register the bag + choice
        widget: the widget is just the factory for the third dispatch as described
        above, so the developer can use the already implemented widgets listed below::
        
        <view
        type="zope.publisher.interfaces.browser.IBrowserRequest"
        for="zope.schema.interfaces.IBag
        zope.schema.interfaces.IChoice"
        provides="zope.app.form.interfaces.IDisplayWidget"
        factory=".ChoiceCollectionDisplayWidget"
        permission="zope.Public"
        />
        
        <view
        type="zope.publisher.interfaces.browser.IBrowserRequest"
        for="zope.schema.interfaces.IBag
        zope.schema.interfaces.IChoice"
        provides="zope.app.form.interfaces.IInputWidget"
        factory=".ChoiceCollectionInputWidget"
        permission="zope.Public"
        />
        
        Beyond this, the developer may also have a generic bag widget she wishes to
        register.  This might look something like this, assuming there's a
        `BagSequenceWidget` available in this package::
        
        <view
        type="zope.publisher.interfaces.browser.IBrowserRequest"
        for="zope.schema.interfaces.IBag
        zope.schema.interfaces.IField"
        provides="zope.app.form.interfaces.IInputWidget"
        factory=".BagSequenceWidget"
        permission="zope.Public"
        />
        
        Then any widgets for the bag and a vocabulary would be registered according to
        this general pattern, in which `IIterableVocabulary` would be the interface of
        any appropriate vocabulary and `BagWidget` is some appropriate widget::
        
        <view
        type="zope.publisher.interfaces.browser.IBrowserRequest"
        for="zope.schema.interfaces.IBag
        zope.schema.interfaces.IIterableVocabulary"
        provides="zope.app.form.interfaces.IInputWidget"
        factory=".BagWidget"
        permission="zope.Public"
        />
        
        
        Choice widgets and the missing value
        ====================================
        
        Choice widgets for a non-required field include a "no value" item to allow for
        not selecting any value at all. This value used to be omitted for required
        fields on the assumption that the widget should avoid invalid input from the
        start.
        
        However, if the context object doesn't yet have a field value set and there's
        no default value, a dropdown widget would have to select an arbitrary value
        due to the way it is displayed in the browser. This way, the field would
        always validate, but possibly with a value the user never chose consciously.
        
        Starting with version 3.6.0, dropdown widgets for required fields display a
        "no value" item even for required fields if an arbitrary value would have to
        be selected by the widget otherwise.
        
        To switch the old behaviour back on for backwards compatibility, do
        
        zope.app.form.browser.itemswidgets.EXPLICIT_EMPTY_SELECTION = False
        
        during application start-up.
        
        
        ============================================================
        Simple example showing ObjectWidget and SequenceWidget usage
        ============================================================
        
        The following implements a Poll product (add it as
        zope/app/demo/poll) which has poll options defined as:
        
        label
        A `TextLine` holding the label of the option
        description
        Another `TextLine` holding the description of the option
        
        Simple stuff.
        
        Our Poll product holds an editable list of the `PollOption` instances.
        This is shown in the ``poll.py`` source below::
        
        from persistent import Persistent
        from interfaces import IPoll, IPollOption
        from zope.interface import implements, classImplements
        
        class PollOption(Persistent, object):
        implements(IPollOption)
        
        class Poll(Persistent, object):
        implements(IPoll)
        
        def getResponse(self, option):
        return self._responses[option]
        
        def choose(self, option):
        self._responses[option] += 1
        self._p_changed = 1
        
        def get_options(self):
        return self._options
        
        def set_options(self, options):
        self._options = options
        self._responses = {}
        for option in self._options:
        self._responses[option.label] = 0
        
        options = property(get_options, set_options, None, 'fiddle options')
        
        And the Schemas are defined in the ``interfaces.py`` file below::
        
        from zope.interface import Interface
        from zope.schema import Object, Tuple, TextLine
        from zope.schema.interfaces import ITextLine
        from zope.i18nmessageid import MessageFactory
        
        _ = MessageFactory("poll")
        
        class IPollOption(Interface):
        label = TextLine(title=u'Label', min_length=1)
        description = TextLine(title=u'Description', min_length=1)
        
        class IPoll(Interface):
        options = Tuple(title=u'Options',
        value_type=Object(IPollOption, title=u'Poll Option'))
        
        def getResponse(option): "get the response for an option"
        
        def choose(option): 'user chooses an option'
        
        Note the use of the `Tuple` and `Object` schema fields above.  The
        `Tuple` could optionally have restrictions on the min or max number of
        items - these will be enforced by the `SequenceWidget` form handling
        code. The `Object` must specify the schema that is used to generate its
        data.
        
        Now we have to specify the actual add and edit views. We use the existing
        AddView and EditView, but we pre-define the widget for the sequence because
        we need to pass in additional information. This is given in the
        ``browser.py`` file::
        
        from zope.app.form.browser.editview import EditView
        from zope.app.form.browser.add import AddView
        from zope.app.form import CustomWidgetFactory
        from zope.app.form.browser import SequenceWidget, ObjectWidget
        
        from interfaces import IPoll
        from poll import Poll, PollOption
        
        class PollVoteView:
        __used_for__ = IPoll
        
        def choose(self, option):
        self.context.choose(option)
        self.request.response.redirect('.')
        
        ow = CustomWidgetFactory(ObjectWidget, PollOption)
        sw = CustomWidgetFactory(SequenceWidget, subwidget=ow)
        
        class PollEditView(EditView):
        __used_for__ = IPoll
        
        options_widget = sw
        
        class PollAddView(AddView):
        __used_for__ = IPoll
        
        options_widget = sw
        
        Note the creation of the widget via a `CustomWidgetFactory`.  So,
        whenever the options_widget is used, a new
        ``SequenceWidget(subwidget=CustomWidgetFactory(ObjectWidget,
        PollOption))`` is created. The subwidget argument indicates that each
        item in the sequence should be represented by the indicated widget
        instead of their default. If the contents of the sequence were just
        `Text` fields, then the default would be just fine - the only odd cases
        are Sequence and Object Widgets because they need additional arguments
        when they're created.
        
        Each item in the sequence will be represented by a
        ``CustomWidgetFactory(ObjectWidget, PollOption)`` - thus a new
        ``ObjectWidget(context, request, PollOption)`` is created for each
        one. The `PollOption` class ("factory") is used to create new instances
        when new data is created in add forms (or edit forms when we're adding
        new items to a Sequence).
        
        Tying all this together is the ``configure.zcml``::
        
        <configure xmlns='http://namespaces.zope.org/zope'
        xmlns:browser='http://namespaces.zope.org/browser'>

        </configure>
        
        Note the use of the ``class`` attribute on the ``addform`` and
        ``editform`` elements.  Otherwise, nothing much exciting here.
        
        Finally, we have some additional views...

        =============
        Object Widget
        =============
        
        The following example shows a Family with Mother and Father.
        First define the interface for a person:
        
        >>> from zope.interface import Interface, implements
        >>> from zope.schema import TextLine
        
        >>> class IPerson(Interface):
        ...     """Interface for Persons."""
        ...
        ...     name = TextLine(title=u'Name', description=u'The first name')
        
        Let's define the class:
        
        >>> class Person(object):
        ...
        ...     implements(IPerson)
        ...
        ...     def __init__(self, name=''):
        ...         self.name = name
        
        Let's define the interface family:
        
        >>> from zope.schema import Object
        
        >>> class IFamily(Interface):
        ...     """The familiy interface."""
        ...
        ...     mother = Object(title=u'Mother',
        ...                     required=False,
        ...                     schema=IPerson)
        ...
        ...     father = Object(title=u'Father',
        ...                     required=False,
        ...                     schema=IPerson)
        
        Let's define the class family with FieldProperty's mother and father
        FieldProperty validate the values if they get added:
        
        >>> from zope.schema.fieldproperty import FieldProperty
        
        >>> class Family(object):
        ...     """The familiy interface."""
        ...
        ...     implements(IFamily)
        ...
        ...     mother = FieldProperty(IFamily['mother'])
        ...     father = FieldProperty(IFamily['father'])
        ...
        ...     def __init__(self, mother=None, father=None):
        ...         self.mother = mother
        ...         self.father = father
        
        Let's make a instance of Family with None attributes:
        
        >>> family = Family()
        >>> bool(family.mother == None)
        True
        
        >>> bool(family.father == None)
        True
        
        Let's make a instance of Family with None attributes:
        
        >>> mother = Person(u'Margrith')
        >>> father = Person(u'Joe')
        >>> family = Family(mother, father)
        >>> IPerson.providedBy(family.mother)
        True
        
        >>> IPerson.providedBy(family.father)
        True
        
        Let's define a dummy class which doesn't implements IPerson:
        
        >>> class Dummy(object):
        ...     """Dummy class."""
        ...     def __init__(self, name=''):
        ...         self.name = name
        
        Raise a SchemaNotProvided exception if we add a Dummy instance to a Family
        object:
        
        >>> foo = Dummy('foo')
        >>> bar = Dummy('bar')
        >>> family = Family(foo, bar)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        SchemaNotProvided
        
        Now let's setup a enviroment for use the widget like in a real application:
        
        >>> from zope.app.testing import ztapi
        >>> from zope.publisher.browser import TestRequest
        >>> from zope.schema.interfaces import ITextLine
        >>> from zope.schema import TextLine
        >>> from zope.app.form.browser import TextWidget
        >>> from zope.app.form.browser import ObjectWidget
        >>> from zope.app.form.interfaces import IInputWidget
        
        Register the TextLine widget used in the IPerson interface for the field 'name'.
        
        >>> ztapi.browserViewProviding(ITextLine, TextWidget, IInputWidget)
        
        Let's define a request and provide input value for the mothers name used
        in the family object:
        
        >>> request = TestRequest(HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE='pl')
        >>> request.form['field.mother.name'] = u'Margrith Ineichen'
        
        Before we update the object let's check the value name of the mother
        instance on the family object:
        
        >>> family.mother.name
        u'Margrith'
        
        Now let's initialize a ObjectWidget with the right attributes:
        
        >>> mother_field = IFamily['mother']
        >>> factory = Person
        >>> widget = ObjectWidget(mother_field, request, factory)
        
        Now comes the magic. Apply changes means we force the ObjectWidget to read
        the request, extract the value and save it on the content. The ObjectWidget
        instance uses a real Person class (factory) for add the value. The value is
        temporary stored in this factory class. The ObjectWidget reads the value from
        this factory and set it to the attribute 'name' of the instance mother
        (The object mother is allready there). If we don't have a instance mother
        allready store in the family object, the factory instance will be stored
        directly to the family attribute mother. For more information see the method
        'applyChanges()' in the interface
        zope.app.form.browser.objectwidget.ObjectWidget.
        
        >>> widget.applyChanges(family)
        True
        
        Test the updated mother's name value on the object family:
        
        >>> family.mother.name
        u'Margrith Ineichen'
        
        >>> IPerson.providedBy(family.mother)
        True
        
        So, now you know my mothers and fathers name. I hope it's also clear how to
        use the Object field and the ObjectWidget.
        
        
        ==============
        Source Widgets
        ==============
        
        Sources are objects that represent sets of values from which one might choose
        and are used with Choice schema fields. Source widgets currently fall into two
        categories:
        
        - widgets for iterable sources
        
        - widgets for queryable sources
        
        Sources (combined with the available adapters) may support both approaches, but
        no widgets currently support both.
        
        In both cases, the widgets need views that can be used to get tokens to
        represent source values in forms, as well as textual representations of values.
        We use the `zope.browser.interfaces.ITerms` views for that.
        
        All of our examples will be using the component architecture::
        
        >>> import zope.interface
        >>> import zope.component
        >>> import zope.schema
        
        This `ITerms` implementation can be used for the sources involved in
        our tests::
        
        >>> from zope.browser.interfaces import ITerms
        >>> import zope.publisher.interfaces.browser
        >>> import zope.app.form.browser.interfaces
        >>> from zope.schema.vocabulary import SimpleTerm
        >>> class ListTerms:
        ...
        ...     zope.interface.implements(ITerms)
        ...
        ...     def __init__(self, source, request):
        ...         pass # We don't actually need the source or the request :)
        ...
        ...     def getTerm(self, value):
        ...         title = unicode(value)
        ...         try:
        ...             token = title.encode('base64').strip()
        ...         except binascii.Error:
        ...             raise LookupError(token)
        ...         return SimpleTerm(value, token=token, title=title)
        ...
        ...     def getValue(self, token):
        ...         return token.decode('base64')
        
        This view just uses the unicode representations of values as titles and the
        base-64 encoding of the titles as tokens.  This is a very simple strategy
        that's only approriate when the values have short and unique unicode
        representations.
        
        All of the source widgets are in a single module::
        
        >>> import zope.app.form.browser.source
        
        We'll also need request objects::
        
        >>> from zope.publisher.browser import TestRequest
        
        
        Iterable Source Widgets
        =======================
        
        Iterable sources are expected to be simpler than queriable sources, so they
        represent a good place to start.  The most important aspect of iterable sources
        for widgets is that it's actually possible to enumerate all the values from the
        source.  This allows each possible value to be listed in a  <select> form field.
        
        Let's start with a simple example.  We have a very trivial source,
        which is basically a list::
        
        >>> class SourceList(list):
        ...     zope.interface.implements(zope.schema.interfaces.IIterableSource)
        
        We need to register our `ITerms` view::
        
        >>> zope.component.provideAdapter(
        ...     ListTerms,
        ...     (SourceList, zope.publisher.interfaces.browser.IBrowserRequest))
        
        Let's define a choice field using our iterable source::
        
        >>> dog = zope.schema.Choice(
        ...    __name__ = 'dog',
        ...    title=u"Dogs",
        ...    source=SourceList(['spot', 'bowser', 'prince', 'duchess', 'lassie']),
        ...    )
        
        >>> dog = dog.bind(object())
        
        When we get a choice input widget for a choice field, the default widget
        factory gets a view on the field and the field's source.  We'll just create the
        view directly::
        
        >>> request = TestRequest()
        >>> widget = zope.app.form.browser.source.SourceSelectWidget(
        ...     dog, dog.source, request)
        
        >>> print widget()
        <div>
        <div class="value">
        <select id="field.dog" name="field.dog" size="5" >
        <option value="c3BvdA==">spot</option>
        <option value="Ym93c2Vy">bowser</option>
        <option value="cHJpbmNl">prince</option>
        <option value="ZHVjaGVzcw==">duchess</option>
        <option value="bGFzc2ll">lassie</option>
        </select>
        </div>
        <input name="field.dog-empty-marker" type="hidden" value="1" />
        </div>
        
        Since the field is required, an empty selection is not valid:
        
        >>> widget.getInputValue()
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        MissingInputError: ('field.dog', u'Dogs', None)
        
        Also, the widget is required in this case:
        
        >>> widget.required
        True
        
        If the request contains a value, it is marked as selected::
        
        >>> request.form["field.dog-empty-marker"] = "1"
        >>> request.form["field.dog"] = "Ym93c2Vy"
        
        >>> print widget()
        <div>
        <div class="value">
        <select id="field.dog" name="field.dog" size="5" >
        <option value="c3BvdA==">spot</option>
        <option selected="selected" value="Ym93c2Vy">bowser</option>
        <option value="cHJpbmNl">prince</option>
        <option value="ZHVjaGVzcw==">duchess</option>
        <option value="bGFzc2ll">lassie</option>
        </select>
        </div>
        <input name="field.dog-empty-marker" type="hidden" value="1" />
        </div>
        
        If we set the displayed value for the widget, that value is marked as
        selected::
        
        >>> widget.setRenderedValue("duchess")
        >>> print widget()
        <div>
        <div class="value">
        <select id="field.dog" name="field.dog" size="5" >
        <option value="c3BvdA==">spot</option>
        <option value="Ym93c2Vy">bowser</option>
        <option value="cHJpbmNl">prince</option>
        <option selected="selected" value="ZHVjaGVzcw==">duchess</option>
        <option value="bGFzc2ll">lassie</option>
        </select>
        </div>
        <input name="field.dog-empty-marker" type="hidden" value="1" />
        </div>
        
        Dropdown widgets are achieved with SourceDropdownWidget, which simply
        generates a selection list of size 1::
        
        >>> request = TestRequest()
        >>> widget = zope.app.form.browser.source.SourceDropdownWidget(
        ...     dog, dog.source, request)
        >>> print widget() # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
        <div>
        <div class="value">
        <select id="field.dog" name="field.dog" size="1" >
        <option selected="selected" value="">(no value)</option>...
        
        An alternative to SourceSelectWidget for small numbers of items is
        SourceRadioWidget that provides a radio button group for the items::
        
        >>> request = TestRequest()
        >>> widget = zope.app.form.browser.source.SourceRadioWidget(
        ...     dog, dog.source, request)
        >>> print widget() # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        <div>
        <div class="value">
        <label for="field.dog.0"><input class="radioType" id="field.dog.0"
        name="field.dog" type="radio" value="c3BvdA==" />&nbsp;spot</label><br
        /><label for="field.dog.1"><input class="radioType" id="field.dog.1"
        name="field.dog" type="radio" value="Ym93c2Vy" />&nbsp;bowser</label><br
        /><label for="field.dog.2"><input class="radioType" id="field.dog.2"
        name="field.dog" type="radio" value="cHJpbmNl" />&nbsp;prince</label><br
        /><label for="field.dog.3"><input class="radioType" id="field.dog.3"
        name="field.dog" type="radio" value="ZHVjaGVzcw==" />&nbsp;duchess</label><br
        /><label for="field.dog.4"><input class="radioType" id="field.dog.4"
        name="field.dog" type="radio" value="bGFzc2ll" />&nbsp;lassie</label>
        </div>
        <input name="field.dog-empty-marker" type="hidden" value="1" />
        </div>
        
        We'll select an item by setting the appropriate fields in the request::
        
        >>> request.form['field.dog-empty-marker'] = '1'
        >>> request.form['field.dog'] = 'bGFzc2ll'
        >>>
        >>> widget = zope.app.form.browser.source.SourceRadioWidget(
        ...     dog, dog.source, request)
        >>> print widget() # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        <div>
        <div class="value">
        <label for="field.dog.0"><input class="radioType" id="field.dog.0"
        name="field.dog" type="radio" value="c3BvdA==" />&nbsp;spot</label><br
        /><label for="field.dog.1"><input class="radioType" id="field.dog.1"
        name="field.dog" type="radio" value="Ym93c2Vy" />&nbsp;bowser</label><br
        /><label for="field.dog.2"><input class="radioType" id="field.dog.2"
        name="field.dog" type="radio" value="cHJpbmNl" />&nbsp;prince</label><br
        /><label for="field.dog.3"><input class="radioType" id="field.dog.3"
        name="field.dog" type="radio" value="ZHVjaGVzcw==" />&nbsp;duchess</label><br
        /><label for="field.dog.4"><input class="radioType" checked="checked"
        id="field.dog.4" name="field.dog" type="radio" value="bGFzc2ll"
        />&nbsp;lassie</label>
        </div>
        <input name="field.dog-empty-marker" type="hidden" value="1" />
        </div>
        
        For list-valued fields with items chosen from iterable sources, there are the
        SourceMultiSelectWidget and SourceOrderedMultiSelectWidget widgets. The latter
        widget includes support for re-ording the list items.
        SourceOrderedMultiSelectWidget is configured as the default widget for lists of
        choices.
        
        If you don't need ordering support through the web UI, then you can use
        the simpler SourceMultiSelectWidget::
        
        >>> dogSource = SourceList([
        ...     u'spot', u'bowser', u'prince', u'duchess', u'lassie'])
        >>> dogs = zope.schema.List(
        ...     __name__ = 'dogs',
        ...     title=u"Dogs",
        ...     value_type=zope.schema.Choice(
        ...         source=dogSource,
        ...     )
        ... )
        >>> dogs = dogs.bind(object()) # give the field a context
        
        >>> request = TestRequest()
        >>> widget = zope.app.form.browser.source.SourceMultiSelectWidget(
        ...     dogs, dogSource, request)
        
        Let's look at the rendered widget::
        
        >>> print widget() # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        <div>
        <div class="value">
        <select id="field.dogs" multiple="multiple" name="field.dogs:list"
        size="5" ><option value="c3BvdA==">spot</option>
        <option value="Ym93c2Vy">bowser</option>
        <option value="cHJpbmNl">prince</option>
        <option value="ZHVjaGVzcw==">duchess</option>
        <option value="bGFzc2ll">lassie</option></select>
        </div>
        <input name="field.dogs-empty-marker" type="hidden" value="1" />
        </div>
        
        We have no input yet::
        
        >>> try:
        ...     widget.getInputValue()
        ... except zope.app.form.interfaces.MissingInputError:
        ...     print 'no input'
        no input
        
        Select an item::
        
        >>> request.form['field.dogs-empty-marker'] = '1'
        >>> request.form['field.dogs'] = ['bGFzc2ll']
        >>> widget.getInputValue()
        ['lassie']
        
        and another::
        
        >>> request.form['field.dogs'] = ['cHJpbmNl', 'bGFzc2ll']
        >>> widget.getInputValue()
        ['prince', 'lassie']
        
        Finally, what does the widget look like now::
        
        >>> print widget() # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        <div>
        <div class="value">
        <select id="field.dogs" multiple="multiple" name="field.dogs:list"
        size="5" ><option value="c3BvdA==">spot</option>
        <option value="Ym93c2Vy">bowser</option>
        <option selected="selected" value="cHJpbmNl">prince</option>
        <option value="ZHVjaGVzcw==">duchess</option>
        <option selected="selected" value="bGFzc2ll">lassie</option></select>
        </div>
        <input name="field.dogs-empty-marker" type="hidden" value="1" />
        </div>
        
        
        An alternative for small numbers of items is to use SourceMultiCheckBoxWidget::
        
        >>> request = TestRequest()
        >>> widget = zope.app.form.browser.source.SourceMultiCheckBoxWidget(
        ...     dogs, dogSource, request)
        
        The rendered widget::
        
        >>> print widget() # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        <div>
        <div class="value">
        <label for="field.dogs.0"><input class="checkboxType" id="field.dogs.0"
        name="field.dogs" type="checkbox" value="c3BvdA==" />&nbsp;spot</label><br
        /><label for="field.dogs.1"><input class="checkboxType" id="field.dogs.1"
        name="field.dogs" type="checkbox" value="Ym93c2Vy"
        />&nbsp;bowser</label><br
        /><label for="field.dogs.2"><input class="checkboxType" id="field.dogs.2"
        name="field.dogs" type="checkbox" value="cHJpbmNl"
        />&nbsp;prince</label><br
        /><label for="field.dogs.3"><input class="checkboxType" id="field.dogs.3"
        name="field.dogs" type="checkbox"
        value="ZHVjaGVzcw==" />&nbsp;duchess</label><br
        /><label for="field.dogs.4"><input class="checkboxType" id="field.dogs.4"
        name="field.dogs" type="checkbox" value="bGFzc2ll"
        />&nbsp;lassie</label>
        </div>
        <input name="field.dogs-empty-marker" type="hidden" value="1" />
        </div>
        
        We have no input yet::
        
        >>> try:
        ...     widget.getInputValue()
        ... except zope.app.form.interfaces.MissingInputError:
        ...     print 'no input'
        no input
        
        Select an item::
        
        >>> request.form['field.dogs-empty-marker'] = '1'
        >>> request.form['field.dogs'] = ['bGFzc2ll']
        >>> widget.getInputValue()
        ['lassie']
        
        and another::
        
        >>> request.form['field.dogs'] = ['c3BvdA==', 'bGFzc2ll']
        >>> widget.getInputValue()
        ['spot', 'lassie']
        
        Finally, what does the widget look like now::
        
        >>> print widget() # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        <div>
        <div class="value">
        <label for="field.dogs.0"><input class="checkboxType" checked="checked"
        id="field.dogs.0" name="field.dogs" type="checkbox" value="c3BvdA=="
        />&nbsp;spot</label><br
        /><label for="field.dogs.1"><input class="checkboxType" id="field.dogs.1"
        name="field.dogs" type="checkbox" value="Ym93c2Vy"
        />&nbsp;bowser</label><br
        /><label for="field.dogs.2"><input class="checkboxType" id="field.dogs.2"
        name="field.dogs" type="checkbox" value="cHJpbmNl"
        />&nbsp;prince</label><br
        /><label for="field.dogs.3"><input class="checkboxType" id="field.dogs.3"
        name="field.dogs" type="checkbox"
        value="ZHVjaGVzcw==" />&nbsp;duchess</label><br
        /><label for="field.dogs.4"><input class="checkboxType" checked="checked"
        id="field.dogs.4" name="field.dogs" type="checkbox" value="bGFzc2ll"
        />&nbsp;lassie</label>
        </div>
        <input name="field.dogs-empty-marker" type="hidden" value="1" />
        </div>
        
        
        For list ordering support, use SourceOrderedMultiSelectWidget::
        
        >>> request = TestRequest()
        >>> widget = zope.app.form.browser.source.SourceOrderedMultiSelectWidget(
        ...     dogs, dogSource, request)
        
        The widget is too complicated to show in complete rendered form here.
        Insted, we'll inspect the properties of the widget::
        
        >>> from zope.app.form.interfaces import MissingInputError
        >>> try:
        ...     widget.getInputValue()
        ... except MissingInputError:
        ...     print 'no input'
        no input
        
        >>> widget.choices() == [
        ...     {'text': u'spot',    'value': 'c3BvdA=='},
        ...     {'text': u'bowser',  'value': 'Ym93c2Vy'},
        ...     {'text': u'prince',  'value': 'cHJpbmNl'},
        ...     {'text': u'duchess', 'value': 'ZHVjaGVzcw=='},
        ...     {'text': u'lassie',  'value': 'bGFzc2ll'}
        ... ]
        True
        
        >>> widget.selected()
        []
        
        Let's try out selecting items. Select one item::
        
        >>> request.form['field.dogs-empty-marker'] = '1'
        >>> request.form['field.dogs'] = ['bGFzc2ll']
        >>> widget.selected() # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        [{'text': u'lassie',  'value': 'bGFzc2ll'}]
        
        >>> widget.getInputValue()
        ['lassie']
        
        Select two items::
        
        >>> request.form['field.dogs'] = ['c3BvdA==', 'bGFzc2ll']
        >>> widget.selected()  # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        [{'text': u'spot',    'value': 'c3BvdA=='},
        {'text': u'lassie',  'value': 'bGFzc2ll'}]
        
        >>> widget.getInputValue()
        ['spot', 'lassie']
        
        
        For set-valued fields, use SourceMultiSelectSetWidget::
        
        >>> dogSet = zope.schema.Set(
        ...     __name__ = 'dogSet',
        ...     title=u"Dogs",
        ...     value_type=zope.schema.Choice(
        ...         source=dogSource,
        ...     )
        ... )
        >>> dogSet = dogSet.bind(object()) # give the field a context
        >>> request = TestRequest()
        >>> widget = zope.app.form.browser.source.SourceMultiSelectSetWidget(
        ...     dogSet, dogSource, request)
        
        >>> try:
        ...     widget.getInputValue()
        ... except zope.app.form.interfaces.MissingInputError:
        ...     print 'no input'
        no input
        
        >>> print widget()  # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        <div>
        <div class="value">
        <select id="field.dogSet" multiple="multiple"
        name="field.dogSet:list" size="5" ><option value="c3BvdA==">spot</option>
        <option value="Ym93c2Vy">bowser</option>
        <option value="cHJpbmNl">prince</option>
        <option value="ZHVjaGVzcw==">duchess</option>
        <option value="bGFzc2ll">lassie</option></select>
        </div>
        <input name="field.dogSet-empty-marker" type="hidden" value="1" />
        </div>
        
        Let's try out selecting items. Select one item::
        
        >>> request.form['field.dogSet-empty-marker'] = '1'
        >>> request.form['field.dogSet'] = ['bGFzc2ll']
        >>> widget.getInputValue()
        set(['lassie'])
        
        Select two items::
        
        >>> request.form['field.dogSet'] = ['c3BvdA==', 'bGFzc2ll']
        >>> widget.getInputValue()
        set(['spot', 'lassie'])
        
        The rendered widget (still with the two items selected) looks like this::
        
        >>> print widget()  # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        <div>
        <div class="value">
        <select id="field.dogSet" multiple="multiple"
        name="field.dogSet:list" size="5" ><option selected="selected"
        value="c3BvdA==">spot</option>
        <option value="Ym93c2Vy">bowser</option>
        <option value="cHJpbmNl">prince</option>
        <option value="ZHVjaGVzcw==">duchess</option>
        <option selected="selected" value="bGFzc2ll">lassie</option></select>
        </div>
        <input name="field.dogSet-empty-marker" type="hidden" value="1" />
        </div>
        
        
        
        Source Widget Query Framework
        =============================
        
        An important aspect of sources is that they may have too many values to
        enumerate.  Rather than listing all of the values, we, instead, provide
        interfaces for querying values and selecting values from query results.
        Matters are further complicated by the fact that different sources may have
        very different interfaces for querying them.
        
        To make matters more interesting, a source may be an aggregation of several
        collections, each with their own querying facilities. An example of such a
        source is a principal source, where principals might come from a number of
        places, such as an LDAP database and ZCML-based principal definitions.
        
        The default widgets for selecting values from sources use the
        following approach:
        
        - One or more query objects are obtained from the source by adapting the source
        to `zope.schema.ISourceQueriables`. If no adapter is obtained, then the
        source itself is assumed to be queriable.
        
        - For each queriable found, a
        `zope.app.form.browser.interfaces.ISourceQueryView` view is looked up. This
        view is used to obtain the HTML for displaying a query form. The view is also
        used to obtain search results.
        
        Let's start with a simple example.  We have a very trivial source,
        which is basically a list:
        
        >>> class SourceList(list):
        ...     zope.interface.implements(zope.schema.interfaces.ISource)
        
        We need to register our `ITerms` view::
        
        >>> zope.component.provideAdapter(
        ...     ListTerms,
        ...     (SourceList, zope.publisher.interfaces.browser.IBrowserRequest))
        
        We aren't going to provide an adapter to `ISourceQueriables`, so the source
        itself will be used as it's own queriable.  We need to provide a query view
        for the source::
        
        >>> class ListQueryView:
        ...
        ...     zope.interface.implements(
        ...         zope.app.form.browser.interfaces.ISourceQueryView)
        ...     zope.component.adapts(
        ...         SourceList,
        ...         zope.publisher.interfaces.browser.IBrowserRequest,
        ...         )
        ...
        ...     def __init__(self, source, request):
        ...         self.source = source
        ...         self.request = request
        ...
        ...     def render(self, name):
        ...         return (
        ...             '<input name="%s.string">\n'
        ...             '<input type="submit" name="%s" value="Search">'
        ...             % (name, name)
        ...             )
        ...
        ...     def results(self, name):
        ...         if name in self.request:
        ...             search_string = self.request.get(name+'.string')
        ...             if search_string is not None:
        ...                 return [value
        ...                         for value in self.source
        ...                         if search_string in value
        ...                         ]
        ...         return None
        
        >>> zope.component.provideAdapter(ListQueryView)
        
        Now, we can define a choice field::
        
        >>> dog = zope.schema.Choice(
        ...    __name__ = 'dog',
        ...    title=u"Dogs",
        ...    source=SourceList(['spot', 'bowser', 'prince', 'duchess', 'lassie']),
        ...    )
        
        As before, we'll just create the view directly::
        
        >>> request = TestRequest()
        >>> widget = zope.app.form.browser.source.SourceInputWidget(
        ...     dog, dog.source, request)
        
        Now if we render the widget, we'll see the input value (initially nothing) and
        a form elements for seaching for values::
        
        >>> print widget()
        <div class="value">
        <div class="row">
        <div class="label">
        Selected
        </div>
        <div class="field">
        Nothing
        </div>
        </div>
        <input type="hidden" name="field.dog.displayed" value="y" />
        <div class="queries">
        <div class="query">
        <div class="queryinput">
        <input name="field.dog.query.string">
        <input type="submit" name="field.dog.query" value="Search">
        </div> <!-- queryinput -->
        </div> <!-- query -->
        </div> <!-- queries -->
        </div> <!-- value -->
        
        This shows that we haven't selected a dog. We get a search box that we can type
        seach strings into.  Let's supply a search string. We do this by providing data
        in the form and by "selecting" the submit button::
        
        >>> request.form['field.dog.displayed'] = u'y'
        >>> request.form['field.dog.query.string'] = u'o'
        >>> request.form['field.dog.query'] = u'Search'
        
        Because the field is required, a non-selection is not valid. Thus, while the
        widget still hasInput, it will raise an error when you getInputValue::
        
        >>> widget.hasInput()
        True
        >>> widget.getInputValue()
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        MissingInputError: ('dog', u'Dogs', None)
        
        If the field is not required::
        
        >>> dog.required = False
        
        then as long as the field is displayed, the widget still has input but returns
        the field's missing value::
        
        >>> widget.hasInput()
        True
        >>> widget.getInputValue() # None
        
        Now if we render the widget, we'll see the search results::
        
        >>> dog.required = True
        >>> print widget()
        <div class="value">
        <div class="row">
        <div class="label">
        Selected
        </div>
        <div class="field">
        Nothing
        </div>
        </div>
        <input type="hidden" name="field.dog.displayed" value="y" />
        <div class="queries">
        <div class="query">
        <div class="queryinput">
        <input name="field.dog.query.string">
        <input type="submit" name="field.dog.query" value="Search">
        </div> <!-- queryinput -->
        <div class="queryresults">
        <select name="field.dog.query.selection">
        <option value="Ym93c2Vy">bowser</option>
        <option value="c3BvdA==">spot</option>
        </select>
        <input type="submit" name="field.dog.query.apply" value="Apply" />
        </div> <!-- queryresults -->
        </div> <!-- query -->
        </div> <!-- queries -->
        </div> <!-- value -->
        
        If we select an item::
        
        >>> request.form['field.dog.displayed'] = u'y'
        >>> del request.form['field.dog.query.string']
        >>> del request.form['field.dog.query']
        >>> request.form['field.dog.query.selection'] = u'c3BvdA=='
        >>> request.form['field.dog.query.apply'] = u'Apply'
        
        Then we'll show the newly selected value::
        
        >>> print widget()
        <div class="value">
        <div class="row">
        <div class="label">
        Selected
        </div>
        <div class="field">
        spot
        </div>
        </div>
        <input type="hidden" name="field.dog" value="c3BvdA==" />
        <input type="hidden" name="field.dog.displayed" value="y" />
        <div class="queries">
        <div class="query">
        <div class="queryinput">
        <input name="field.dog.query.string">
        <input type="submit" name="field.dog.query" value="Search">
        </div> <!-- queryinput -->
        </div> <!-- query -->
        </div> <!-- queries -->
        </div> <!-- value -->
        
        Note that we should have an input value now, since pressing the 'Apply' button
        provides us with input::
        
        >>> widget.hasInput()
        True
        
        We should also be able to get the input value::
        
        >>> widget.getInputValue()
        'spot'
        
        Now, let's look at a more complicated example. We'll define a source that
        combines multiple sources::
        
        >>> class MultiSource:
        ...
        ...     zope.interface.implements(
        ...        zope.schema.interfaces.ISource,
        ...        zope.schema.interfaces.ISourceQueriables,
        ...        )
        ...
        ...     def __init__(self, *sources):
        ...         self.sources = [(unicode(i), s) for (i, s) in enumerate(sources)]
        ...
        ...     def __contains__(self, value):
        ...         for i, s in self.sources:
        ...             if value in s:
        ...                 return True
        ...         return False
        ...
        ...     def getQueriables(self):
        ...         return self.sources
        
        This multi-source implements `ISourceQueriables`. It assumes that the sources
        it's given are queriable and just returns the sources as the queryable objects.
        
        We can reuse our terms view::
        
        >>> zope.component.provideAdapter(
        ...     ListTerms,
        ...     (MultiSource, zope.publisher.interfaces.browser.IBrowserRequest))
        
        Now, we'll create a pet choice that combines dogs and cats::
        
        >>> pet = zope.schema.Choice(
        ...    __name__ = 'pet',
        ...    title=u"Dogs and Cats",
        ...    source=MultiSource(
        ...      dog.source,
        ...      SourceList(['boots', 'puss', 'tabby', 'tom', 'tiger']),
        ...      ),
        ...    )
        
        and a widget::
        
        >>> widget = zope.app.form.browser.source.SourceInputWidget(
        ...     pet, pet.source, request)
        
        Now if we display the widget, we'll see search inputs for both dogs
        and cats::
        
        >>> print widget()
        <div class="value">
        <div class="row">
        <div class="label">
        Selected
        </div>
        <div class="field">
        Nothing
        </div>
        </div>
        <input type="hidden" name="field.pet.displayed" value="y" />
        <div class="queries">
        <div class="query">
        <div class="queryinput">
        <input name="field.pet.MA__.string">
        <input type="submit" name="field.pet.MA__" value="Search">
        </div> <!-- queryinput -->
        </div> <!-- query -->
        <div class="query">
        <div class="queryinput">
        <input name="field.pet.MQ__.string">
        <input type="submit" name="field.pet.MQ__" value="Search">
        </div> <!-- queryinput -->
        </div> <!-- query -->
        </div> <!-- queries -->
        </div> <!-- value -->
        
        As before, we can perform a search::
        
        >>> request.form['field.pet.displayed'] = u'y'
        >>> request.form['field.pet.MQ__.string'] = u't'
        >>> request.form['field.pet.MQ__'] = u'Search'
        
        In which case, we'll get some results::

        >>> request.form['field.pet.MQ__.apply'] = u'Apply'
        
        and get a selection::
        
        >>> print widget()
        <div class="value">
        <div class="row">

        </div> <!-- query -->
        </div> <!-- queries -->
        </div> <!-- value -->
        
        Note that we should have an input value now, since pressing the 'Apply' button
        provides us with input::
        
        >>> widget.hasInput()
        True
        
        and we can get the input value::
        
        >>> widget.getInputValue()
        'tabby'
        
        There's a display widget, which doesn't use queriables, since it doesn't assign
        values::
        
        >>> request = TestRequest()
        >>> widget = zope.app.form.browser.source.SourceDisplayWidget(
        ...     pet, pet.source, request)
        >>> print widget()
        Nothing
        >>> from zope.app.form.browser.interfaces import IBrowserWidget
        >>> IBrowserWidget.providedBy(widget)
        True
        
        >>> widget.setRenderedValue('tabby')
        >>> print widget()
        tabby
        
        Like any good display widget, input is not required::
        
        >>> widget.required
        False
        
        If we specify a list of choices::
        
        >>> pets = zope.schema.List(__name__ = 'pets', title=u"Pets",
        ...                         value_type=pet)
        
        when a widget is computed for the field, a view will be looked up for the field
        and the source, where, in this case, the field is a list field. We'll just call
        the widget factory directly::
        
        >>> widget = zope.app.form.browser.source.SourceListInputWidget(
        ...     pets, pets.value_type.source, request)
        
        If we render the widget::
        
        >>> print widget()
        <div class="value">
        <input type="hidden" name="field.pets.displayed" value="y" />
        <div class="queries">
        <div class="query">
        <div class="queryinput">
        <input name="field.pets.MA__.string">
        <input type="submit" name="field.pets.MA__" value="Search">
        </div> <!-- queryinput -->
        </div> <!-- query -->
        <div class="query">
        <div class="queryinput">
        <input name="field.pets.MQ__.string">
        <input type="submit" name="field.pets.MQ__" value="Search">
        </div> <!-- queryinput -->
        </div> <!-- query -->
        </div> <!-- queries -->
        </div> <!-- value -->
        
        Here the output looks very similar to the simple choice case.  We get a search
        input for each source.  In this case, we don't show any inputs
        (TODO we probably should make it clearer that there are no selected values.)
        
        As before, we can search one of the sources::
        
        >>> request.form['field.pets.displayed'] = u'y'
        >>> request.form['field.pets.MQ__.string'] = u't'
        >>> request.form['field.pets.MQ__'] = u'Search'
        
        In which case, we'll get some results::
        
        >>> print widget()
        <div class="value">
        <input type="hidden" name="field.pets.displayed" value="y" />
        <div class="queries">
        <div class="query">
        <div class="queryinput">
        <input name="field.pets.MA__.string">
        <input type="submit" name="field.pets.MA__" value="Search">
        </div> <!-- queryinput -->
        </div> <!-- query -->
        <div class="query">
        <div class="queryinput">
        <input name="field.pets.MQ__.string">
        <input type="submit" name="field.pets.MQ__" value="Search">
        </div> <!-- queryinput -->
        <div class="queryresults">
        <select name="field.pets.MQ__.selection:list" multiple>
        <option value="Ym9vdHM=">boots</option>
        <option value="dGFiYnk=">tabby</option>
        <option value="dGlnZXI=">tiger</option>
        <option value="dG9t">tom</option>
        </select>
        <input type="submit" name="field.pets.MQ__.apply" value="Apply" />
        </div> <!-- queryresults -->
        </div> <!-- query -->
        </div> <!-- queries -->
        </div> <!-- value -->
        
        from which we can select some values::
        
        >>> request.form['field.pets.displayed'] = u'y'
        >>> del request.form['field.pets.MQ__.string']
        >>> del request.form['field.pets.MQ__']
        >>> request.form['field.pets.MQ__.selection'] = [
        ...     u'dGFiYnk=', u'dGlnZXI=', u'dG9t']
        >>> request.form['field.pets.MQ__.apply'] = u'Apply'
        
        Which then leads to the selections appearing as widget selections::
        
        >>> print widget()
        <div class="value">
        <input type="checkbox" name="field.pets.checked:list" value="dGFiYnk=" />
        tabby
        <input type="hidden" name="field.pets:list" value="dGFiYnk=" />
        <br />
        <input type="checkbox" name="field.pets.checked:list" value="dGlnZXI=" />
        tiger
        <input type="hidden" name="field.pets:list" value="dGlnZXI=" />
        <br />
        <input type="checkbox" name="field.pets.checked:list" value="dG9t" />
        tom
        <input type="hidden" name="field.pets:list" value="dG9t" />
        <br />
        <input type="submit" name="field.pets.remove" value="Remove" />
        <br />
        <input type="hidden" name="field.pets.displayed" value="y" />
        <div class="queries">
        <div class="query">
        <div class="queryinput">

        <div class="query">

        </div> <!-- queryinput -->
        </div> <!-- query -->
        </div> <!-- queries -->
        </div> <!-- value -->
        
        We can get the selected values::
        
        >>> widget.getInputValue()
        ['tabby', 'tiger', 'tom']
        
        We now see the values we selected.  We also have checkboxes and buttons that
        allow us to remove selections::
        
        >>> request.form['field.pets.displayed'] = u'y'
        >>> request.form['field.pets'] = [u'dGFiYnk=', u'dGlnZXI=', u'dG9t']
        >>> del request.form['field.pets.MQ__.selection']
        >>> del request.form['field.pets.MQ__.apply']
        >>> request.form['field.pets.checked'] = [u'dGFiYnk=', u'dG9t']
        >>> request.form['field.pets.remove'] = u'Remove'
        
        >>> print widget()

        Using vocabulary-dependent widgets with sources
        ===============================================
        
        if you have a widget that uses old-style vocabularies but don't have the time
        to rewrite it for sources, all is not lost! The wrapper
        IterableSourceVocabulary can be used to make sources and ITerms look like a
        vocabulary. This allows us to use vocabulary-based widgets with sources
        instead of vocabularies.
        
        Usage::
        
        >>> from zope.schema.vocabulary import SimpleTerm
        
        >>> values  = [u'a', u'b', u'c']
        >>> tokens  = [ '0',  '1',  '2']
        >>> titles  = [u'A', u'B', u'C']
        
        >>> terms = [SimpleTerm(values[i], token=tokens[i], title=titles[i]) \
        ...     for i in range(0,len(values))]
        
        >>> class TestSource(list):
        ...     zope.interface.implements(zope.schema.interfaces.IIterableSource)
        >>> source = TestSource(values)
        
        >>> class TestTerms(object):
        ...     zope.interface.implements(ITerms)
        ...     def __init__(self, source, request):
        ...         pass
        ...     def getTerm(self, value):
        ...         index = values.index(value)
        ...         return terms[index]
        ...     def getValue(self, token):
        ...         index = tokens.index(token)
        ...         return values[index]
        
        >>> zope.component.provideAdapter(
        ...     TestTerms,
        ...     (TestSource, zope.publisher.interfaces.browser.IBrowserRequest))
        
        >>> from zope.app.form.browser.source import IterableSourceVocabulary
        >>> request = TestRequest()
        >>> vocab = IterableSourceVocabulary(source, request)
        >>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyClass, verifyObject
        >>> verifyClass(zope.schema.interfaces.IVocabularyTokenized, \
        ...     IterableSourceVocabulary)
        True
        >>> verifyObject(zope.schema.interfaces.IVocabularyTokenized, vocab)
        True
        
        >>> len(vocab)
        3
        >>> (u'a' in vocab) and (u'b' in vocab) and (u'c' in vocab)
        True
        >>> [value for value in vocab] == terms
        True
        >>> term = vocab.getTerm(u'b')
        >>> (term.value, term.token, term.title)
        (u'b', '1', u'B')
        >>> term = vocab.getTermByToken('2')
        >>> (term.value, term.token, term.title)
        (u'c', '2', u'C')
        
        
        ====================
        Internationalization
        ====================
        
        Forms are fully internationalized.  The field names, descriptions,
        labels, and hints are all automatically translated if they are made
        i18n messages in the schema.
        
        Let's take this simple add form...
        
        >>> print http(r"""

        ... """, handle_errors=False)
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        ...
        
        with an error...
        
        >>> print http(r"""

        Source widgets
        ==============
        
        Titles of terms are translated by the source widgets. Let's create a source
        for which the terms create message ids:
        
        >>> import zc.sourcefactory.basic
        >>> from zope.i18nmessageid import MessageFactory
        >>> _ = MessageFactory('coffee')
        >>> class Coffees(zc.sourcefactory.basic.BasicSourceFactory):
        ...     def getValues(self):
        ...         return ['arabica', 'robusta', 'liberica', 'excelsa']
        ...     def getTitle(self, value):
        ...         return _(value, default='Translated %s' % value)

        CHANGES
        =======
        
        3.11.1 (2009-12-22)
        ===================
        
        - Prefer zope.testing.doctest over doctestunit and adjust test output to newer
        zope.schema release.
        
        3.11.0 (2009-12-18)
        ===================
        
        - Use zope.component.testing in favor of zope.app.testing where possible.
        
        - Define dummy standard_macros for test purposes. This reduces the test
        dependencies by zope.app.basicskin and zope.browserresource.
        
        - Removed the zope.app.container and zope.app.publisher testing dependencies.
        
        - Refactored code to remove zope.app.component dependency.
        
        - Made the tests independent of zope.app.locales.
        
        - Reduce zope.app test dependencies by avoiding zope.app.securitypolicy and
        zope.app.zcmlfiles.
        
        3.10.0 (2009-12-17)
        ===================
        
        - Avoid the ``zope.app.basicskin`` dependency, by defining our own FormMacros.
        
        3.9.0 (2009-10-08)
        ==================
        
        - Internationalized 'Invalid value' used with ConversionError
        - Added dependency on transaction and test dependency on zope.app.component.
        - Moved dependencies on ZODB3 and zope.location to the test extra.
        - Reduced the dependency on zope.app.publisher to a dependency on
        zope.browsermenu plus a test dependency on zope.browserpage.
        
        3.8.1 (2009-07-23)
        ==================
        
        - Fix unittest failure due to translation update.
        
        3.8.0 (2009-05-24)
        ==================
        
        - Use standard properties instead of `zope.cachedescriptors`.
        
        - Require `zope.browser` 1.1 instead of `zope.app.container` for IAdding.
        
        3.7.3 (2009-05-11)
        ==================
        
        - Fixed invalid markup.
        
        3.7.2 (2009-03-12)
        ==================
        
        - Fixed bug where OrderedMultiSelectWidget did not respect the widgets
        size attribute.
        
        - Fixed bug in SequenceWidget where it crashed while trying to iterate
        a missing_value (None in most of cases) on _getRenderedValue.
        
        - Adapt to removal of deprecated interfaces from zope.component.interfaces.
        The IView was moved to zope.publisher and we use our custom IWidgetFactory
        interface instead of removed zope.component.interfaces.IViewFactory.
        
        - Fix tests to work on Python 2.6.
        
        3.7.1 (2009-01-31)
        ==================
        
        - Adapt to the upcoming zope.schema release 3.5.1 which will also silence the
        spurious `set` failures.
        
        3.7.0 (2008-12-11)
        ==================
        
        - use zope.browser.interfaces.ITerms instead of zope.app.form.browser.interfaces
        
        - Depending on zope.schema>=3.5a1 which uses the builtin ``set`` instead of the
        ``sets`` module.
        
        
        3.6.4 (2008-11-26)
        ==================
        
        - The URIDisplayWidget doesn't render an anchor for empty/None values.
        
        
        3.6.3 (2008-10-15)
        ==================
        
        - Get rid of deprecated usage of LayerField from
        zope.app.component.back35, replaced by
        zope.configuration.fields.GlobalInterface.
        
        3.6.2 (2008-09-08)
        ==================
        
        
        - Fixed restructured text in doc tests to unbreak the PyPI page.
        
        (3.6.1 skipped due to a typo)
        
        
        3.6.0 (2008-08-22)
        ==================
        
        - Dropdown widgets display an item for the missing value even if the field is
        required when no value is selected. See zope/app/form/browser/README.txt on
        how to switch this off for BBB.
        
        - Source select widgets for required fields are now required as well. They
        used not to be required on the assumption that some value would be selected
        by the browser, which had always been wrong except for dropdown widgets.
        
        
        3.5.0 (2008-06-05)
        ==================
        
        - Translate the title on SequenceWidget's "Add <title>" button.
        
        - No longer uses zapi.

        ==================
        
        - Made display widgets for sources translate message IDs correctly.
        
        
        3.4.1 (2007-10-31)
        ==================
        
        - Resolve ``ZopeSecurityPolicy`` deprecation warning.
        
        
        3.4.0 (2007-10-24)
        ==================
        
        - ``zope.app.form`` now supports Python2.5
        
        - Initial release independent of the main Zope tree.
