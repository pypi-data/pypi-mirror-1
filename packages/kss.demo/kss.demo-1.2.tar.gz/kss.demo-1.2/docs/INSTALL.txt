kss.demo Installation
=====================

 * When you're reading this you have probably already run 
   ``easy_install kss.demo``. Find out how to install setuptools
   (and EasyInstall) here:
   http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall

 * Copy the files ``kss/demo/kss.demo-configure.zcml`` and 
   ``kss/demo/kss.demo-meta.zcml`` in the
   ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.
   
 * On Zope 2.8, the package-includes directory is not created by
   default, so you also have to create it.

 * In the ZMI, add a "Kss Simple content" anywhere. Call it
   "kssdemo" or anything you wish.

 * Get into "test" page, you should have a menu with available demos.
