Description: 
        
        PyHJB is a python client library for accessing JMS 1.1 (Java Message Service)
        messaging providers via HJB, the HTTP JMS bridge.
        
        `HJB <http://hjb.berlios.de>`_ provides access to JMS resources via HTTP.  It
        acts as an HTTP gateway server for any JMS messaging provider, and provides a
        RESTful equivalent for most of the non-optional portions of the JMS API.
        
        PyHJB is a pure python package which, via HJB, allows python programs to:
        
        * send/receive messages from **any** Enterprise Messaging System that
        supports JMS.  It is distributed with a few demo scripts showing it being
        used with a selection of well-known messaging providers: WebSphere MQ,
        Swift MQ, Active MQ and JBoss Messaging.
        
        * register JMS administrable objects via JMS, e.g, queues, topics and
        connection factories.
        
        * configure JMS runtime objects, e.g, connections, sessions, message
        consumers, message producers, queue browsers and durable subscribers etc.
        
        Importantly, python programs written using PyHJB are portable across JMS
        messaging providers.  The programs use the JMS API via HTTP rather than a
        vendor's custom messaging API, and thus combine two important maintainability
        traits:
        
        * the use of the JMS API
        
        * being written in python!
