SECURITY_AUTHENTICATION=none
#
#  If you don't have SECURITY_AUTHENTICATION=none, then JMSAdmin will
#  prompt you for the User DN and password.  If you want to bypass these
#  prompts then you can specify one or both of the values here.  Since
#  the password here is in cleartext this is not normally recommended
#  except for testing.  You should replace these values with your own.
