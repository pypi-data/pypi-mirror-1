Todos:

* on reconfiguration empty etc/package-includes

* return all directories created by dzhandle as well

* before execution check if dzhandle already contains the given target in its 
  list of zopes. we dont want to have two times the same name in system or user
  directories for one zope-version.

* check var directory: we might have content in here, like added by 
  filesystemstorage, dont trash it

* support of ZEO-Server (has no hi priority).

* use and test it.
