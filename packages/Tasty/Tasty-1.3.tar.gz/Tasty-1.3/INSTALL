For the latest installation notes, please see:

http://microapps.sourceforge.net/tasty/installation.html

basically, though:


First, you'll need a database (preferably postgresql; that's what the
rest of this document will use as an example. it should work with just
about any database that SQLObject supports though) installed and
running on your system. Then you'll need to install
setuptools/easy_install (if you don't already have it installed).

currently, you need to get it out of svn trunk:

% svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/microapps/tasty/trunk Tasty

The easiest path to installation is then to use the workingenv.py
script in the project directory to download and install all of the
python dependencies for you:

% cd Tasty/
% python workingenv.py -r requirements.txt working-env

That will create a 'working-env' directory with all of the
requirements installed in it. You must then activate the environment
to run tasty:

% source working-env/bin/activate

You should then run the unit tests to make sure everything was
installed properly. It should look something like:

% nosetests
............................
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 28 tests in 2.876s

OK

To set up the database (again, using PostgreSQL as the example),
you'll need to create a database user and a new database:

% createuser tasty
% createdb tasty

If you change either of those, you'll want to change the entries in dev.cfg and/or prod.cfg

TurboGears can then set up the database tables with:

% tg-admin sql create

And it should be ready to run:

% python start-tasty.py
# or, for a production setup (no auto-reloading, etc)
% python start-tasty.py prod.cfg
