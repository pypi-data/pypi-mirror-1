Changelog
=========

1.0rc6 (2008-09-22)
-------------------

* Deprecate plone.recipe.varnish:build in favour of zc.recipe.cmmi: it does
  not make sense to duplicate its logic here.
  [wichert]

* Add feature to enable verbose headers in varnish.vcl. This is primary 
  interesting for debugging of cache-settings. See README.txt.
  [jensens]

* Deal better with sources which do not have executable-bits set or
  are svn exports.
  [wichert]

* The 1.0rc5 release was broken and has been retracted. Currently the trunk
  is only usable with the Varnish 2.0-beta1 and later.
  [hannosch]


1.0rc5 (2008-04-27)
-------------------

* Pipe is evil: it pipes the whole connection to the backend which means
  varnish will no longer process any further requests if HTTP pipelining is
  used. Switch to using pass instead.
  [wichert]

* Add a default_ttl of zero seconds to the Varnish runner to avoid a Varnish
  bug with the handling of an Expires header with a date in the past.
  [newbery]

* Merged branches/newbery-hostnamepath.
  [newbery]

* We don't need to include Accept-Encoding in the hash. Varnish takes care
  of Vary negotiation already. 
  [newbery]


1.0rc4 (2008-03-18)
-------------------

* Fixed typos / whitespace.
  [hannosch]

* Varnish 1.1.2 is out.
  [wichert]

* Merged witsch-foreground-support back to trunk.
  [witsch]

* Use a pidfile.
  [wichert]


1.0rc3 (2007-09-02)
-------------------

* Fixed a bug where options["location"] was being used before it was being set.
  [rocky]

* Made the module name determination a little more robust during
  createVarnishConfig so that recipes that specify version deps still work.
  [rocky]

* Do not use defaults for user and group.
  [wichert]

* We do need the parts: we use it for the file storage.
  [wichert]


1.0rc2 (2007-08-29)
-------------------

* Add an option to use an existing configuration file.
  [wichert]

* Remove hardcoded caching for images, binaries, CSS and javascript. This
  should be done by the backend server or a custom varnish configuration.
  [wichert]

* Add Accept-Encoding to the cache key so we can handle compressed content.
  [wichert]

* Test if a bin-directory exists. This allows us to compile varnish 1.0
  which does not have an sbin directory.
  [wichert]


1.0rc1 (2007-08-27)
-------------------

* Document the OSX bugfix we apply when building varnish.
  [wichert]

* Add a dummy update method to prevent needless recompiles.
  [wichert]

* Update for Varnish 1.1.1.
  [wichert]


1.0b2 (2007-08-25)
-------------------

* When building from svn, we need to run autogen.sh.
  [optilude]

* Refactor the recipe: there are now separate recipes to build and configure
  Varnish. This makes it possible to reconfigure varnish without having to
  recompile with as well as using an already installed varnish.
  [wichert]

* Move the OSX patching code into a separate method.
  [wichert]

* Use pass for non-GET/HEAD requests. This makes a bit more sense and fixes a
  login problem for Plone sites.
  [wichert]

* Reorganize a bit for readability.
  [wichert]

* Support Python 2.3 as well.
  [wichert]

* Make it possible to specify the user and group as well.
  [wichert]

* Do not create the source directory - we move the extracted source in its
  place later.
  [wichert]

* If running on OS X, patch libtool as described in
  http://varnish.projects.linpro.no/ticket/118 and
  http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.varnish.misc/668/focus=669.
  [optilude]

* VCL is not C. You need the curlies even on single-line if statements.
  [optilude]

* This rewriting style only works on Zope 3 - Zope 3 reinvented that wheel.
  [wichert]

* Add support for If-Modified-Since and If-None-Match requests.
  Thanks to newbery for the suggstions.
  [wichert]

* Explicitly mention that there is nothing Plone or Zope specific about
  this recipe.
  [wichert]


1.0b1 (2007-08-04)
------------------

* More documentation.
  [wichert]

  [wichert]

* Use the port varnish is bound to in the VHM mapping.
  [wichert]

* Define all default values centrally.
  [wichert]

* Add support for Zope virtual hosts.
  [wichert]

* Add support for virtual hosting.
  [wichert]
