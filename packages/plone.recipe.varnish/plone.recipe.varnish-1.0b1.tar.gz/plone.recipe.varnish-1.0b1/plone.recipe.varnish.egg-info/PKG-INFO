Description: Varnish recipe for buildout
        ===========================
        
        plone.recipe.varnish is a `zc.buildout`_ recipe to install `Varnish`_.
        
        Configuring it is very simple. For example::
        
        [varnish]
        recipe = plone.recipe.varnish
        url = http://puzzle.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/varnish/varnish-1.1.tar.gz
        bind = 127.0.0.1:8000
        backends = 127.0.0.1:8080
        cache-size = 1G
        
        This configures a buildout part which runs Varnish to listen on 127.0.0.1:8000
        for requests, using a 1 gigabyte cache and sending requests to a backend
        at 127.0.0.1:8080.
        
        Wrappers for all the varnish commands are created in the bin directory
        of your buildout.
        
        
        Virtual hosting
        ---------------
        
        Varnish supports virtual hosting by selecting a different backend server
        based on headers on the incoming request. You can configure the backends
        through the backends option::
        
        [varnish]
        backends =
        plone.org:127.0.0.1:8000
        plone.net:127.0.0.1:9000
        
        This will generate a configuration which sends all traffic for the plone.org
        host to a backend server running on port 8000 while all traffic for the
        plone.net host is send to port 9000.
        
        Zope hosting
        ------------
        
        If you are using Zope as backend server you will need to rewrite the URL
        so the Zope Virtual Host Monster can generate correct links for links in
        your pages. This can be done either by a web server such as Apache or nginx
        but can also be done by Varnish. This can be configured using the
        **zope_vhm_map** option. Here is an example::
        
        [varnish]
        zope_vhm_map =
        plone.org:/plone
        plone.net:/plone
        
        This tells us that the domain plone.org should be mapped to the location
        /plone in the backend. By combing this with the information from the
        **backends** option a varnish configuration will be generated that
        maps URLs correctly.
        
        
        Option reference
        ----------------
        
        url
        URL for an archive containing the Varnish sources. Either **url** or
        **svn** has to be specified.
        
        svn
        URL for a subversion repository containing Varnish sources. Either **url**
        or **svn** has to be specified.
        
        cache-size
        The size of the cache.
        
        bind
        Hostname and port on which Varnish will listen for requests. Defaults
        to 127.0.0.1:8000.
        
        backends
        Specifies the backend or backends which will process the (uncached)
        requests. There are two ways to specify backends: using
        **hostname:backend server:backend port** or **backend server:backend
        port**. Using the first option allows you to do virtual hosting. If
        multiple backends are specified you have to use the full form including
        the (virtual) hostname. Defaults to 127.0.0.1:8080.
        
        zope_vhm_map
        Defines a virtual host mapping for Zope servers. This is a list of
        **hostname:ZODB location** entries which specify the location inside
        Zope where the website for a virtual host lives.
        
        telnet
        If specified sets the hostname and port on which Varnish will listen
        for commands using its telnet interface.
