History of plonehrm.notes
=========================

1.0.2 (2009-05-26)
------------------

- Added link to notes_listing in notes viewlet.  [jladage]

- Removed .mo files from locales.  This means those translations will
  not be visible in the old Plone 3.0.  [maurits]


1.0.1 (2009-04-16)
------------------

- Removed plonehrm: Add/Modify personaldata permissions from our
  rolemap.xml.  Those permissions will be gone soon, and I am not sure
  what they did here in plonehrm.notes in the first place...
  [maurits+mike]

- Use collective.autopermission to register permissions.
