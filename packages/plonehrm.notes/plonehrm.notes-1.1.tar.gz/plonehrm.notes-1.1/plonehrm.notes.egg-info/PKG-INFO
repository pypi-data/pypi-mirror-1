Description: Notes for Plone HRM
        ===================
        
        This extension module adds very simple notes to the Employee content
        type of Plone HRM.
        
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        A plonehrm extension module to add note to an employee.
        
        >>> from plonehrm.notes.notes import Note, Notes
        
        
        A Note is persistent dict with a simple unicode string and a date.
        
        >>> n1 = Note(u'My first little note.')
        >>> n1.text
        u'My first little note.'
        
        
        >>> from datetime import date
        >>> n1.date == date.today().isoformat()
        True
        
        Notes is a persistent list that stores the notes.
        
        >>> nts = Notes()
        
        But it only takes text as input, not an already existing note:
        
        >>> nts.addNote(n1)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        AssertionError: string expected, got <class 'plonehrm.notes.notes.Note'>
        
        We can still add the plain text of a Note though.
        
        >>> nts.addNote(n1.text)
        >>> nts.addNote(u'It could be much longer if you prefer that.')
        >>> print nts
        [<plonehrm.notes.notes.Note ...>, <plonehrm.notes.notes.Note ...>]
        
        And always insure that the text attribute is unicode.
        
        >>> n3 = Note(u'H\xc3\xa9 daar!')
        >>> unicode(n3.text)
        u'H\xc3\xa9 daar!'
        >>> n3.text
        u'H\xc3\xa9 daar!'
        
        Now we want to remove a note.
        
        >>> nts.addNote(u"Please remove this note.")
        >>> len(nts)
        3
        >>> nts.removeNote(u"Please remove this note.")
        >>> len(nts)
        2
        >>> nts.removeNote(u"This note does not exist.")
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ValueError: list.remove(x): x not in list
        
        
        History of plonehrm.notes
        =========================
        
        1.1 (2010-01-15)
        ----------------
        
        - Some changes in the tests so it can handle the new permissions
        checking. [vincent]
        
        
        1.0.7 (2010-01-07)
        ------------------
        
        - The viewlet is now guarded by the 'plonehrm: view notes viewlet'
        permission. The 'delete' button is guarded by 'plonehrm: manage
        notes' and the 'add' button is still guarded by 'plonehrm: add
        note'. [vincent]
        
        
        1.0.6 (2009-07-29)
        ------------------
        
        - Updated KSS actions of the note viewlet. Now, info messages are
        displayed when a note is created or deleted. The message is hidden
        when the user hits the 'cancel' button. [vincent]
        
        
        1.0.5 (2009-06-23)
        ------------------
        
        - Nothing changed yet.
        
        
        1.0.4 (2009-06-15)
        ------------------
        
        - Nothing changed yet.
        
        
        1.0.3 (2009-06-03)
        ------------------
        
        - Now the 'Note' viewlet acts as the other viewlets in the Employee
        view. An 'Add' button is present in the header, which allows to show
        a form to add a new Note. Once the note added, the form disappears
        and the list is shown again. [vincent]
        
        
        1.0.2 (2009-05-26)
        ------------------
        
        - Added link to notes_listing in notes viewlet.  [jladage]
        
        - Removed .mo files from locales.  This means those translations will
        not be visible in the old Plone 3.0.  [maurits]
        
        
        1.0.1 (2009-04-16)
        ------------------
        
        - Removed plonehrm: Add/Modify personaldata permissions from our
        rolemap.xml.  Those permissions will be gone soon, and I am not sure
        what they did here in plonehrm.notes in the first place...
        [maurits+mike]
        
        - Use collective.autopermission to register permissions.
        [maurits]
        
        - Set end-of-line style as native and set svn:ignore.  [maurits]
