        What is zope.introspectorui?
        ============================
        
        `zope.introspectorui` is a set of views for the information objects provided
        by zope.introspector.
        
        Installing zope.introspectorui
        ==============================
        
        `zope.introspectorui` is provided as an Python egg on cheeseshop and set
        up via `zc.buildout`_
        
        .. _zc.buildout: http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout
        
        You may have setuptools already installed for your system Python. In
        that case, you may need to upgrade it first because buildout requires
        a very recent version::
        
        $ sudo easy_install -U setuptools
        
        If this command fails because easy_install is not available, there is
        a good chance you do not have setuptools available for your system
        Python. If so, there is no problem because setuptools will be
        installed locally by buildout.
        
        Because `zope.introspectorui` is a developer tool, you normally use it
        by including the package the `setup.py` file of your own
        package. There will most probably a section called `install_requires`
        where you add 'zope.introspector' like this::
        
        ...
        install_requires=['setuptools',
        # Add extra requirements here
        'zope.introspectorui',
        ...
        ],
        
        In `zc.buildout` based package setups you can 'activate' usage of
        `zope.introspectorui` afterwards simply by (re)running `bin/buildout`.
