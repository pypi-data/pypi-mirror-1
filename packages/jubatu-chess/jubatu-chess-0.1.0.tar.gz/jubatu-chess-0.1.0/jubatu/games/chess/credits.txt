Here is a list of the people who has contributed
to the development of this plugin, by generously offering his work or by helping otherwise:

Will McGugan (http://www.willmcgugan.com), the author of the chess.py module used in this plugin to manage the rules
of the game. Will's module is a nicely structured chess module which is, in this plugin, managing
the details of the rules in the background. In case you are interested in using Will's module for your own
project, bear in mind that it's not covered by the X11/MIT license, so you should ask Will for permission.

Morio (http://blenderartists.org/forum/member.php?u=19768), a member of the Blender community who has
kindly allowed us to use their chess piece models for the artwork of this plugin. The chess pieces you can
see in the 3d interface are low-poly versions of Morio's high quality original pieces. In case you are
interested in using those models, you should ask Morio for permission.

Andreas Naive (http://andreasnaive.blogspot.com), main developer of this plugin at the moment this is being written.
 
Thanks to the helpful people in the Panda3D's forums (http://panda3d.org/phpbb2/index.php) for his patiente and kindness
in helping us to solve the problems arisen with Panda3D during the development of this plugin.

Thanks to the Blender Foundation by releasing to the public domain the "Blender Texture Disc", which is the source
of the textures in this plugin.
