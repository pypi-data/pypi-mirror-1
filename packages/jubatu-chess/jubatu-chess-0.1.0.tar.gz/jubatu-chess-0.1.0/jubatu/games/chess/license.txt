Will McGugan, who retains all the rights, and has given his authorization

- The chess piece models contained in the 'frontend/models' directory, which
are low-poly versions of some high quality models by Morio, who gave his
permission for his work to be used in this plugin. (The board model is,
however, covered by the general X11/MIT license.)
- The textures contained in the 'frontend/textures' directory, which
are in the public domain.
