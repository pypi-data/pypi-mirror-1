Description: 
        Squisher can take a directory representing a Python package (i.e. a directory with __init__.py and so on) and "squish" it into a single .pyc file that you can import, or run on the command line, just like any other .py/.pyc file.
        
        The hook is that it can be thus imported without necessarily having Squisher itself installed. All you do is run Squisher on a directory (or an existing zip file if you wish), and you get a single file you can import with any normal Python installation.
        
        It is complementary to Eggs in a way. They're good for having packages globally installed and keeping them up-to-date, but very often you may want the simple convenience of dropping a .pyc in a directory and importing it. Furthermore, since Squished packages are just zip files with a special Python bytecode header (and Eggs are just zipfiles with internal metadata added), you can actually run it on an Egg and get a file that can be used as an Egg or a Squished package just by renaming it.
