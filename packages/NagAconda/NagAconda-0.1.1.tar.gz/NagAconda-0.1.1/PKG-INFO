Description: 
        :mod:`NagAconda` -- Python Nagios Integration
        =============================================
        
        Nagios has been around for quite some time, but producing output it can
        consume is something of a black art. Only the plugin documentation actually
        explains what all the extra semicolons or extended formatting even means.
        
        This is especially onerous when performance consuming add-ons expect a
        specific structure before operating properly. This package strives to
        greatly simplify the process of actually generating Nagios output.
