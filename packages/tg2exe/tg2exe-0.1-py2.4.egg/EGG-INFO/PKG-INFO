Description: tg2exe is a "tg-admin" extension which could help you converting the TurboGears project to an
        Stand Alone Application on windows platform.
        
        Advantage
        --------------
        The benifit is you can use TurboGears' power to write OffLine applications with web interface
        and AJAX. When the application is running, your computer host as a web server (Actually it is).
        
        Your user can quickly evaluate your application without install python or related modules.
        
        Install
        --------------
        You could use $easy_install tg2exe to install this module
        
        pywin32 is required
        http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/
        
        Usage
        ----------
        Once you installed tg2exe, you'll got an 'makexe' command within the "tg-admin" command line utility.
        Enter your project folder, type "tg-admin makexe" and tg2exe will produce a dist folder for you.
        You could package it into an installer (such as innosetup)
        
        Note
        -----------
        The owe is its distribution size. The raw dist with quickstart project is about 30 MB (Zip size is 11 MB).
        Half-size distribution is expected for future TurboGears.
        
        Current Stage: make it work
        (next stages are make it better, make it small)
        
        Credit
        ------------

        he post the original script on TurboGears MailList in Jul 2006.
