Description: Gui independent meunu system.
        -----------------------------
        
        This is a Python module designed to simplify the specification, creation, and
        dynamic manipulation of gui menus. Menus systems written with this module will
        work without modification on all supported gui's.
        
        The kit supplies wrappers for four common python gui's:
        
        - tkinter    [tkmenukit.py]
        - pygtk      [gtkmenukit.py]
        - pyqt       [qtmenukit.py]
        - wxPython   [wxmenukit.py]
        
        Menus are represented by python objects linked together in a tree structure. The
        python objects can be inactive, or active.  Active menus are connected to real
        menus in the gui and changes made to the python structure will be reflected in
        the gui.
        
        Menus (and menu fragments) can be built up using normal python methods for
        manipulating data structures or from lists of python strings or from data
        formats such as XML, jason, yaml etc. Python menu structures, however
        constructed, can be converted easily into any of these formats.
        
        Porting a menu system from one gui to another, simply involves importing a
        different wrapper module. Everything else will work exactly the same.
