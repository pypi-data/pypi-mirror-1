Description: 
        This module allows your Python programs to easily have a persistent
        global distributed shared state.  This state can be used to store
        things like number of users, game high scores, message of the day from
        the author, etc.  The state has an interface like a dictionary with
        some additional synchronization functionality and some restrictions.
        This module connects to a server on the Google App Engine to store and
        manage data.  It uses a simple security model based on Google
        accounts.
