Twotp, the Twisted Erlang node protocol.

See http://launchpad.net/twotp for current information. Documentation is
available in the doc/ folder.

Twotp depends of Twisted being installed, and required at least Twisted 2.5
(trunk is recommanded). Once installed, run 'trial erlang' to launch the tests.
