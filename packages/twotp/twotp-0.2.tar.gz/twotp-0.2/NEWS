0.2 (2008-03-21)
================

Features
--------

 - Add basic support for dict and set. This is not yet complete, because there
   are some limitations to be able to serialize/unserialize properly, but it's
   enough to be tests.
 - Add a twistd plugin running an Erlang node. To run it and see the options,
   call "twistd twotp --help"

Fixes
-----

 - Fix a problem with signed integer handling.
 - Don't force convertions of list of integers to strings. Previously, we
   forced everything to be a string, which you can't get list of integers.
   Until a better solution appears, it's now forced to list of integers.
 - Fix long management.

Other
-----
 - Add an example of a gtk application talking to a mnesia database.
