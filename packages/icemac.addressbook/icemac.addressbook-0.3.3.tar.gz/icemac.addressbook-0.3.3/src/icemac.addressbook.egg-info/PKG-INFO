        Features
        ========
        
        - store data of persons including (postal address, e-mail address,
        home page address phone number)
        
        - assign keywords to persons
        
        - search for persons by keyword
        
        - export persons found using a search as XLS file
        
        - multi-client capability
        
        - user and role management
        
        - really good test coverage (> 98 %)
        
        User management
        ===============
        
        Roles
        -----
        
        Access to the address book is only granted after authentication. There
        are three roles to authorize a user:
        
        - visitor: visit all person's data, search and export, change own
        password
        
        - editor: permissions of visitor + edit all person's data, change own
        log-in name
        
        - administrator: permissions of editor + create and change address
        book and users
        
        Create new users
        ----------------
        
        Users are persons from the addressbook augmented by log-in
        information.
        
        To create the first new user inside an addressbook the adminstrator
        (who was created in Install_) has to log-in and then do the following:
        
        1. create a new person with an e-mail address using `Add person`.
        
        2. create a new user using `Master data --> Users --> Add user`.
        
        The newly created user has now a log-in (e-mail address) for the
        addressbook the person belonges to.
        
        ==============
        Installation
        ==============
        
        Prerequisites
        =============
        
        You only need Python 2.5.
        
        Install
        =======
        
        CAUTION: icemac.addressbook can't be installed using easy_install, you
        have to follow these steps:
        
        - Download the source distribution (see Download_).
        
        - Extract the downloaded file.
        
        - Run ``install.py`` using your desired python, e. g.::
        
        $ python2.5 install.py
        
        Neither you need any root privileges nor it installs anything outside
        its directory.
        
        Run the tests
        =============
        
        Run the unit tests and functional tests using::
        
        $ bin/test
        
        Run the application
        ===================
        
        The server runs on 127.0.0.1:8080. To change this edit `deploy.ini`.
        
        To run in foreground start using::
        
        $ bin/addressbook fg
        
        To run as a demon process start using::
        
        $ bin/addressbook start
        
        To stop the demon process call::
        
        $ bin/addressbook stop
        
        The default URL is::
        
        http://127.0.0.1:8080
        
        To log-in at this URL you need the username and password you chose
        when running ``install.py``. The are stored in ``admin.zcml``.
        
        Update
        ======
        
        - Do the steps described in Install_ (use a separate directory).
        
        - Copy ``deploy.ini`` and (if necessary) ``admin.zcml`` from the old
        instance to the new one.
        
        - Stop the old version of the application.
        
        - Create a backup of the ZODB using::
        
        $ bin/backup
        
        - Copy the backup directory (``var/backups``) to the new instance.
        
        - Restore the backup using::
        
        $ bin/restore
        
        - Start the new version of the application.

        ============
        Change log
        ============
        
        0.3.3 (2009-04-05)
        ==================
        
        - Added two package dependencies which are necessary to convert an
        existing ZODB of a previous addressbook version.
        
        
        0.3.2 (2009-04-03)
        ==================
        
        - Fixed the sort order of the links in the master data section.
        
        
        0.3.1 (2009-03-31)
        ==================
        
        - Fixed wrong recipe version.
        
        
        0.3 (2009-03-31)
        ================
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Added user management. There is now only one administrative user
        created during installation. This user can log-in using basic
        auth. He can create new users from existing persons inside the
        address books (See `Master data --> Users`.)
        
        
        Bug fixes
        ---------
        
        - Made the AddressBook skin the default skin.
        
        
        Other changes
        -------------
        
        - Dropped support for Python 2.4.
        
        - Renamed role `icemac.addressbook.administrator` to
        `icemac.addressbook.global.administrator` so all global roles have
        the same naming scheme.
        
        - Removed ZMI (Zope Management Interface) from skins in production
        environment. There is a buildout config in ``profiles/zmi.cfg``
        which enables ZMI.
        
        
        0.2 (2009-01-02)
        ================
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Multiple postal addresses, e-mail addresses, phone numbers and home
        page addresses per person are now possible.
        
        - Added XLS export for all stored data (not only the default
        addresses).
        
        - Added new attribute `kind` to postal address. Split `street` into
        `address prefix` and `street`.
        
        - Overview page of all address books now shows number of entries in
        each address book.
        
        Bug fixes
        ---------
        
        - E-Mail adresses with hyphen in host name where not enterable due to
        a picky constraint.
        
        - After changing a keyword title, persons using this keyword where no
        longer found in the keyword search because the index was not
        updated.
        
        - Changed sort order on person edit form: phone number is now
        displayed before e-mail address. Changed XLS export accordingly.
        
        
        0.1.2 (2008-11-23)
        ==================
