Prerequisites
=============

You only need Python 2.5.

CAUTION: icemac.addressbook can't be installed using easy_install, you
have to follow these steps:

- Download the source distribution (see Download_).

- Extract the downloaded file.

- Run ``install.py`` using your desired python, e. g.::

  $ python2.5 install.py

Neither you need any root privileges nor it installs anything outside
its directory.

Run the tests
=============

Run the unit tests and functional tests using::

  $ bin/test

Run the application
===================

The server runs on 127.0.0.1:8080. To change this edit `deploy.ini`.

To run in foreground start using::

  $ bin/addressbook fg

To run as a demon process start using::

  $ bin/addressbook start

To stop the demon process call::

  $ bin/addressbook stop

The default URL is::

  http://127.0.0.1:8080

To log-in at this URL you need the username and password you chose
when running ``install.py``. The are stored in ``admin.zcml``.

======

- Do the steps described in Install_ (use a separate directory).

- Copy ``deploy.ini`` and (if necessary) ``admin.zcml`` from the old
  instance to the new one.

- Stop the old version of the application.

- Create a backup of the ZODB using::

  $ bin/backup

- Copy the backup directory (``var/backups``) to the new instance.

- Restore the backup using::

  $ bin/restore
