        Features
        --------
        
        - Multiple postal addresses, e-mail addresses, phone numbers and home
        page addresses per person are now possible.
        
        - Added XLS export for all stored data (not only the default
        addresses).
        
        - Added new attribute `kind` to postal address. Split `street` into
        `address prefix` and `street`.
        
        - Overview page of all address books now shows number of entries in
        each address book.
        
        Bug fixes
        ---------
        
        - E-Mail adresses with hyphen in host name where not enterable due to
        a picky constraint.
        
        - After changing a keyword title, persons using this keyword where no
        longer found in the keyword search because the index was not
        updated.
        
        - Changed sort order on person edit form: phone number is now
        displayed before e-mail address. Changed XLS export accordingly.
