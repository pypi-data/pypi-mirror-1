        ==============
        Installation
        ==============
        
        Prerequisites
        =============
        
        You only need Python 2.5. (Other python versions are currently not
        supported.)
        
        First installation
        ==================
        
        CAUTION: icemac.addressbook can't be installed using ``easy_install``,
        you have to follow these simple steps.
        
        Neither you need any root privileges nor it installs anything outside
        its directory.
        
        1. Download the source distribution (see Download_).
        
        2. Extract the downloaded file.
        
        3. Run ``install.py`` using your desired python, e. g.::
        
        $ python2.5 install.py
        
        4. Answer the questions about admin user name, password and so on.
        
        5. Run the tests. See `Run the tests`_
        
        6. Start the application. See `Run the application`_
        
        Update
        ======
        
        - When you are updating from version 0.3.x or earlier follow the steps
        described in `First installation`_ followed by the steps described
        in `Second part of steps for older versions`_.
        
        - When you are updating from version 0.4 or newer follow these steps:
        
        1. Download and extract the source distribution (see Download_) to a
        new a directory.
        
        2. Run ``install.py`` using your desired python added by the path
        to the previous installation. This way values you entered
        previously are used as defaults instead of the application
        defaults.  Example::
        
        $ python2.5 install.py ../icemac.addressbook-0.4
        
        3. Answer the questions about admin user name, password and so on.
        
        4. Start the new instance of the application.
        
        - If you get an error when running the application after updating
        which looks like::
        
        zope.app.generations.interfaces.UnableToEvolve: (..., u'icemac.addressbook', ...)
        
        Then you have to upgrade to version 0.5.x first and start the
        application, so that legacy data can be converted. Version 1.x is no
        longer compatible with these older versions.
        
        
        Second part of steps for older versions
        ---------------------------------------
        
        1. Stop the old instance of the application.
        
        2. Create a backup of the ZODB og the old instance using::
        
        $ bin/backup
        
        3. Copy the backup directory (``var/backups``) to the new instance.
        
        4. Restore the backup into the new instance using::
        
        $ bin/restore
        
        5. Start the new instance of the application.
        
        Run the tests
        =============
        
        Run the unit tests and functional tests using::
        
        $ bin/test
        
        Run the application
        ===================
        
        To run the application instance in foreground start using::
        
        $ bin/addressbook fg
        
        To run it as a demon process start using::
        
        $ bin/addressbook start
        
        To stop the demon process call::
        
        $ bin/addressbook stop
        
        The default URL is to access the application is::
        
        http://127.0.0.1:8080
        
        To log-in at this URL you need the username and password you chose
        when running ``install.py``. The are stored in ``admin.zcml``.
        
        Create a new address book using the `add address book` link on the
        right. How to create new users inside this address book is described
        in `Create new users`_.
        
        
        Change configuration of the installation
        ========================================
        
        The values you entered during installation resp. update are stored in
        a file named `install.user.ini` in the address book directory.
        
        To change the configuration values call `install.py` using python and
        enter a `.` as parameter like this::
        
        $ python2.5 install.py .
        
        The configuration questions get presented to you with your previously
        entered values as default.
        
        To remove additional packages you have to edit the ``[package]``
        section of `install.user.ini`. There is currently no other way for
        removal.
        
        =================
        User management
        =================
        
        Roles
        =====
        
        Access to the address book is only granted after authentication. There
        are three roles to authorize a user:
        
        - visitor: visit all person's data, search and export, change own
        password
        
        - editor: permissions of visitor + edit all person's data, change own
        log-in name
        
        - administrator: permissions of editor + create and change address
        book and users
        
        Create new users
        ================
        
        Users are persons from the address book augmented by log-in
        information.
        
        To create the first new user inside an address book the adminstrator
        (who was created in `First installation`_) has to log-in and then do
        the following:
        
        1. create a new person with an e-mail address using `Add person`.
        
        2. create a new user using `Master data --> Users --> Add user`.
        
        The newly created user has now a log-in (e-mail address) for the
        address book the person belonges to.

        Longer term
        ===========
        
        The following features should be implemented over the next months:
        
        - person data
        
        * store picture per person
        
        - company as entity
        
        - import
        
        * vCard

        * full text search
        
        * combined search
        
        * wildcard search

        Change log
        ==========
        
        1.0.0 (2009-12-29)
        ==================
        
        - Translated UI into German.
        
        - Displaying modification date of adresses now.
        
        - Dropped some package dependencies which existed for compatibility
        reasons with older versions. To upgrade to this version you might
        need to upgrade to 0.5.4 first. (See Update_.)
        
        
        0.5.4 (2009-12-20)
        ==================
        
        - Users which are defined inside an address book having the
        `Administrator` role, were not able to edit address book entities.
        
        
        0.5.3 (2009-11-22)
        ==================
        
        - After the last fix `delete all persons` did not delete any
        persons. This is now fixed.
        
        
        0.5.2 (2009-11-21)
        ==================
        
        - `Delete all persons` no longer tries to delete the persons which are
        users. Previously this function broke when there were users defined
        in the address book.
        
        - Moved the function to delete a whole address book to the overview
        page of all address books, as users defined inside an address book
        are not allowed to delete their address book.
        
        
        0.5.1 (2009-11-21)
        ==================
        
        - Fixed namespace package declaration so the package can be installed
        on a plain vanilla python (even without setuptools installed).
        
        
        0.5 (2009-11-21)
        ================
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Users having the role `Administrator` can delete all persons in the
        address book or even the whole address book on the address book edit
        form.
        
        - Last modification time of objects is now stored and displayed (in
        UTC!).
        
        - Users having the role `Administrator` can import data in the master
        data area.
        
        - Added ability to enter additional packages names at installation
        (e. g. to install a specific import file readers).
        
        - Users having the role `Administrator` can add new fields to address
        book entities in the master data area. These fields as useable for
        editors and visitors, too.
        
        Removed features
        ----------------
        
        - Removed some fields which are not always necessary and which can be
        re-added when needed as user defined fields:
        
        - state field on the postal address (only displayed German
        states, though),
        
        - sex field on person,
        
        - notes fields on address book, postal address, phone number, e-mail
        address, home page address, file and keyword,
        
        - kind fields on postal address, phone number, e-mail address and
        home page address.
        
        
        Bug fixes
        ---------
        
        - Uploading a new file changes the stored name of the file.
        
        - When uploading a file with an unknown mime type (aka
        `application/octet-stream`) the actual mime type is guessed using
        the file extension and file content.
        
        - The person list is now ordered by the displayed titles instead of
        the internal ids.
        
        
        0.4 (2009-05-15)
        ================
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Files can be uploaded and added to persons. (Files are stored as
        ZODB-Blob-Objects.)
        
        - Added logging of page accesses to `access.log`.
        
        - ``install.py`` now asks for hostname and portnumber and logging
        configuration, so changing ``deploy.ini`` is no longer necessary.
