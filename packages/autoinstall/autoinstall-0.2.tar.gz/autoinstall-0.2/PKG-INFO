Description: package loader for auto installing Python packages.
        
        A package loader in the spirit of Zero Install that can be used to
        inject dependencies into the import process.
        
        
        To install::
        
        easy_install -U autoinstall
        
        or
        
        download, unpack, python setup.py install
        
        or
        
        try the bootstrap loader. See below.
        
        
        To use::
        
        # You can bind any package name to a URL pointing to something
        # that can be imported using the zipimporter.
        
        autoinstall.bind("pymarc", "http://pypi.python.org/packages/2.5/p/pymarc/pymarc-2.1-py2.5.egg")
        
        import pymarc
        
        print pymarc.__version__, pymarc.__file__
        
        
        Changelog::
        
        - added support for non top level packages.
        - cache files now use filename part from URL.
        - applied patch from Eric Seidel <eseidel@google.com> to add support
        for loading modules where the module is not at the root of the .zip
        file.
        
        
        TODO::
        
        - a description of the intended use case
        - address other issues pointed out in:

        Return the data associated with 'pathname'. Raise IOError if
        the file wasn't found.");
        
        def is_package,
        "is_package(fullname) -> bool.
        
        Return True if the module specified by fullname is a package.
        Raise ZipImportError is the module couldn't be found.");
        
        def get_code,
        "get_code(fullname) -> code object.
        
        Return the code object for the specified module. Raise ZipImportError
        is the module couldn't be found.");
        
        def get_source,
        "get_source(fullname) -> source string.
        
        Return the source code for the specified module. Raise ZipImportError
        is the module couldn't be found, return None if the archive does
        contain the module, but has no source for it.");
        
        
        Autoinstall can also be bootstraped with the nascent package loader
        bootstrap module. For example::
        
        #  or via the bootstrap
        # loader.
        
        try:
        _version = "0.2"
        import autoinstall
        if autoinstall.__version__ != _version:
        raise ImportError("A different version than expected found.")
        except ImportError, e:
        # http://svn.python.org/projects/sandbox/trunk/bootstrap/bootstrap.py
        import bootstrap
        pypi = "http://pypi.python.org"
        dir = "packages/source/a/autoinstall"
        url = "%s/%s/autoinstall-%s.tar.gz" % (pypi, dir, _version)
        bootstrap.main((url,))
        import autoinstall
