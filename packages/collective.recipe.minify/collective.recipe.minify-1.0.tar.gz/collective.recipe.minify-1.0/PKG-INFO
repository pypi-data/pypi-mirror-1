        Detailed Documentation
        **********************
        
        Supported options
        -----------------
        
        The recipe supports the following options:
        
        css-command
        The script to be used for css minification. The YUI compressor is a good
        choice here. This option is not required. If it is omitted, a very simple
        whitespace stripping is done [' '.join(RESOURCE.split())]. The command
        must write its result to the standard output.
        
        js-command
        Same as ``css-command`` but used for JavaScript resources.
        
        ignore
        A list of fnmatch-patters. If a filename matches one of these
        expressions, it is omitted from the minifying process.
        
        paths
        A list of paths, which contains JavaScript and CSS resources. All files
        ending with '.js' and '.css' are considered, except those which are ignored
        explicitly (see ignore option).
        
        suffix
        Filename suffix that is used for the copy of the original file. The default
        is ``-full``. If the orignal filename is ``style.css`` the minified version
        will be ``style.css`` and the original development version will be
        ``style-full.css``.
        
        include-devel
        Include all packages listed in the devel-section of the buildout. This
        option is turned OFF per default.
        
        verbose
        Set verbosity for minify runs. The allowed values are ``true``
        and ``false`` and the default is ``false``.
        
        Example usage
        -------------
        
        A simple buildout that uses the recipe looks like this::
        
        >>> write('buildout.cfg',
        ... """
        ... [buildout]
        ... parts = minify
        ...
        ... [minify]
        ... recipe = collective.recipe.minify
        ... paths =
        ...    ${buildout:directory}/src/foo
        ... ignore =
        ...      firm*
        ... include-devel = false
        ... """)
        
        Running the buildout gives us::
        
        >>> print system(buildout)
        Installing minify.
        Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/minify'.
        <BLANKLINE>
        
        Running this script minifies all JavaScript and CSS resources found in
        the specfied locations. It walks all the paths specified ignoring all files
        matching one of the patterns specified in ignore.
