0.2.0 (2008-09-15)
==================

 - Moved _getCommand/_hasCommand functions relating to bibutils from bibliograph.rendering to bibliograph.core [tim2p].

 - Adjust code relating to IBibContainerIterator so that it uses the new IBibliography interface from bibliograph.core, instead [tim2p].

 - Renamed several interfaces so that they are more naturally understood and consistent, i.e. IBibliographyRenderer -> IReferenceRenderer, IBibliographyExporter -> IBibliographyRenderer [tim2p].

 - Added an optional `omit_fields` (and `omit_fields_mapping` for the utilities) to renderers so that certain fields will not be rendered [tim2p].

 - Adjusted some of the doctests so that they are in the doc strings of implementations rather than separate files so as to keep things a little closer together [tim2p].

 - Adjusted some test code so that it is Windows-aware, i.e. stripping out '\r' from strings before comparing to expected values [tim2p].


0.1.0 (2008-05-02)
==================

 - Created recipe with ZopeSkel [tom_gross].

 - Ported renderer from Products.CMFBibliographyAT
