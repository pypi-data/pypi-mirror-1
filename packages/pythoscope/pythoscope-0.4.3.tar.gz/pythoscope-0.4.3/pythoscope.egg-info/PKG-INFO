Description: Installation
        ============
        
        Easiest way to get Pythoscope is via setuptools::
        
        $ easy_install pythoscope
        
        You can also download a source package from
        http://pythoscope.org/local--files/download/pythoscope-0.4.3.tar.gz
        or get a copy of a development branch using `bazaar <http://bazaar-vcs.org/>`_::
        
        $ bzr branch lp:pythoscope
        
        To install the package from the source directory do::
        
        $ python setup.py install
        
        You don't need setuptools for this to work, a bare Python will do just fine.
        
        However, if you *do* have setuptools installed, you may also consider running
        the whole test suite of Pythoscope::
        
        $ python setup.py test
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        You can use the tool through a single **pythoscope** command. To prepare
        your project for use with Pythoscope, type::
        
        $ pythoscope --init path/to/your/project/
        
        It's only doing static analysis, and doesn't import your modules or
        execute your code in any way, so you're perfectly safe to run it on
        anything you want. After that, a directory named **.pythoscope** will be
        created in the current directory. To generate test stubs based on your
        project, select files you want to generate tests for::
        
        $ pythoscope  path/to/your/project/specific/file.py  path/to/your/project/other/*.py
        
        Test files will be saved to your test directory, if you have one, or
        into a new **tests/** directory otherwise. Test cases are aggregated
        into TestCase classes. Currently each production class and each
        production function gets its own TestCase class.
        
        Some of the classes and functions are ignored by the generator - all
        which name begins with an underscore, exception classes, and some
        others.
        
        Generator itself is configurable to some extent, see::
        
        $ pythoscope --help
        
        for more information on available options.
        
        Editor Integration
        ==================
        
        Emacs
        -----
        
        We put out an elisp script that integrates Pythoscope into Emacs. The file is in the the misc/ directory of the source distribution. You can also `look at the file on Launchpad <http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~pythoscope-developers/pythoscope/trunk/annotate/head:/misc/pythoscope.el>`_. Usage and installation instructions are in the comments at the top of the file.
        
        Vim
        ---
        
        There is interest in Vim integration and someone is working on it but we have nothing for you right now.
        
        Leo
        ---
        
        There was much discussion of Leo on `the mail list editor integration thread <http://groups.google.com/group/pythoscope/browse_thread/thread/ca85a4c506bde99>`_.
