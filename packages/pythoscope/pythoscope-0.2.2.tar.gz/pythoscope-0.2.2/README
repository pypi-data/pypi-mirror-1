Installation
------------

Easiest way to get Pythoscope is via setuptools::

 $ easy_install  pythoscope

You can also download a source package from
http://pythoscope.org/local--files/download/pythoscope-0.2.2.tar.gz.
or get a copy of a development branch using `bazaar <http://bazaar-vcs.org/>`_::

  bzr branch lp:pythoscope

Usage
-----

You can use the tool through a single **pythoscope** command. To analyze
one of your projects, type::

 $ pythoscope  inspect  path/to/your/project/

It's only doing static analysis, and doesn't import your modules or
execute your code in any way, so you're perfectly safe to run it on
anything you want. After that, a file named **.pythoscope** will be
created in the current directory. To generate test stubs based on your
project, select files you want to generate tests for::

 $ pythoscope  generate  path/to/your/project/specific/file.py  path/to/your/project/other/*.py

Test files will be saved into **pythoscope-tests/** directory. Test cases
are aggregated into TestCase classes. Currently each production class
and each production function gets its own TestCase class.

Some of the classes and functions are ignored by the generator - all
which name begins with an underscore, exception classes, and some
others.

Generator itself is configurable to some extent, see::

 $ pythoscope  generate  --help

for more information on available options.
