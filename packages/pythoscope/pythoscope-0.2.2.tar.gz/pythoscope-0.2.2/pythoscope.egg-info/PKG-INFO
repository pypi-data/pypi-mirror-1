Description: Installation
        ------------
        
        Easiest way to get Pythoscope is via setuptools::
        
        $ easy_install  pythoscope
        
        You can also download a source package from
        http://pythoscope.org/local--files/download/pythoscope-0.2.2.tar.gz.
        or get a copy of a development branch using `bazaar <http://bazaar-vcs.org/>`_::
        
        bzr branch lp:pythoscope
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        You can use the tool through a single **pythoscope** command. To analyze
        one of your projects, type::
        
        $ pythoscope  inspect  path/to/your/project/
        
        It's only doing static analysis, and doesn't import your modules or
        execute your code in any way, so you're perfectly safe to run it on
        anything you want. After that, a file named **.pythoscope** will be
        created in the current directory. To generate test stubs based on your
        project, select files you want to generate tests for::
        
        $ pythoscope  generate  path/to/your/project/specific/file.py  path/to/your/project/other/*.py
        
        Test files will be saved into **pythoscope-tests/** directory. Test cases
        are aggregated into TestCase classes. Currently each production class
        and each production function gets its own TestCase class.
        
        Some of the classes and functions are ignored by the generator - all
        which name begins with an underscore, exception classes, and some
        others.
        
        Generator itself is configurable to some extent, see::
        
        $ pythoscope  generate  --help
        
        for more information on available options.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.2.2
        -----
        
        * Fixed the inner classes bug (`#260924 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/pythoscope/+bug/260924>`_).
        * Collector appends new data to .pythoscope file instead of overwriting it.
        * Test modules are being analyzed as well.
        * Using lib2to3 for static code analysis instead of stdlib's compiler module.
        * Generator can append test cases to existing test modules. Preserves comments and original whitespace.
        * Cheetah is no longer a dependency.
        * Renamed 'collect' command to 'inspect'.
        
        0.2.1
        -----
        
        Contains a packaging bug fix, which prevented users from using the tests
        cases generator and running internal pythoscope tests.
        
        0.2
        ---
        
        First release, featuring static code analysis and generation of test
        stubs.
