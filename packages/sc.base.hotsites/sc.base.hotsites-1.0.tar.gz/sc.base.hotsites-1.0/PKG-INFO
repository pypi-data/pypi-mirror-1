        What is a Hot Site here ?
        -------------------------
        
        When you set a folder as a hot site :
        
        1. Removes viewlets around the content: footer, header and top
        
        2. Block all portlets (from parents, from group and from content type), you can re-enable manually, if you want
        
        3. Enable a new skin, via access rule, so you can customize the look'n'feel of your Hot Site
        
        4. Enable a local workflow, defaults to one-state workflow, to simplify the management of Hot Site
        
        5. Limits the addable content types in the Hot Site folder, you can configure the content types
        
        6. Use a content as a template to Hot Site index
        
        7. Optionally, create a page (document) as accessibility content, useful when the hot sites is a Flash content
        
        Options you can setup

        2. Skin name used in the Hot Sites folder
        
        3. Default view id, that will be setted in the Hot Sites folder
        
        4. Default view path, a content template that will be copied and used as the default view of Hot Sites folder
        
        5. Workflow id, workflow used in the Hot Site, will be setted using the Placeful Workflow, defaults to one-state workflow

        Requirements
        ------------
        
        
        - Plone 3.2.x (http://plone.org/products/plone)
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To enable this product,on a buildout based installation:
        
        1. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``sc.base.hotsites``
        to the list of eggs to install ::
        
        [buildout]
        ...
        eggs =
        sc.base.hotsites
        
        2. Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::
        
        [instance]
        ...
        zcml =
        ...
        sc.base.hotsites
        
        
        If another package depends on the sc.base.hotsites egg or
        includes its zcml directly you do not need to specify anything in the
        buildout configuration: buildout will detect this automatically.
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run the ''bin/buildout'',
        which will take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in the Plone interface and click on the
        'Add/Remove Products' link.
        
        Choose the product (check its checkbox) and click the 'Install' button.
        
        Uninstall -- This can be done from the same management screen, but only
        if you installed it from the quick installer.
        
        Note: You may have to empty your browser cache and save your resource registries
        in order to see the effects of the product installation.
