ATContentTypes Support
======================

Ensure that the adapters for various ATCT based content types are in working
order.

Setup
-----

First we create some mock classes for testing content.

    >>> from Products.ATContentTypes.content import folder, file, topic
    >>> from p4a.audio import interfaces
    >>> from zope import interface
    >>> from zope import component
    >>> from Products.Archetypes import interfaces as atifaces

    >>> class MockPortalTypes:
    ...     def listContentTypes(self): return []
    ...     def getTypeInfo(self, portal_type): return None

    >>> class MockCatalog:
    ...     def registerObject(self, ob): pass
    ...     def catalog_object(self, *args, **kwargs): pass

    >>> class MockPortal:
    ...     def getPhysicalPath(self): return ['/']

    >>> class MockPortalTool:
    ...     portal = MockPortal()
    ...     def getPortalObject(self): return self.portal

    >>> class MockFolder(folder.ATFolder):
    ...     portal_types = MockPortalTypes()
    ...     reference_catalog = MockCatalog()
    ...     uid_catalog = MockCatalog()
    ...     uid_catalog.reference_catalog = reference_catalog
    ...     portal_url = MockPortalTool()
    ...     def getFolderContents(self, *args, **kwargs):
    ...         return self.objectValues()
    >>> def schema(context):
    ...     return file.ATFile.schema
    >>> component.provideAdapter(schema,
    ...                          provides=atifaces.ISchema,
    ...                          adapts=(MockFolder,))

    >>> class MockTopic(topic.ATTopic, MockFolder):
    ...     def queryCatalog(self, **kwargs):
    ...         return self.objectValues()

Many of our classes use adapters to handle their logic so we need to setup
a few of the adapters as well.

    >>> from p4a.ploneaudio import atct
    >>> from Products.ATContentTypes import interface as atctifaces
    >>> component.provideAdapter(atct.ATCTFileAudio)

    >>> try:
    ...     from zope.app.annotation.interfaces import IAttributeAnnotatable
    ...     from zope.app.annotation.attribute import AttributeAnnotations
    ... except ImportError, err:
    ...     from zope.annotation.interfaces import IAttributeAnnotatable
    ...     from zope.annotation.attribute import AttributeAnnotations
    >>> component.provideAdapter(AttributeAnnotations)

Next we setup some mock folder content that we can test with.

    >>> testfolder = MockFolder('testfolder')
    >>> file1 = file.ATFile('file1')
    >>> class MockFile(file.ATFile):
    ...     interface.implements(atctifaces.IATFile,
    ...                          IAttributeAnnotatable,
    ...                          interfaces.IMediaActivator)
    ...     media_activated = False
    >>> def schema(context):
    ...     return file.ATFile.schema
    >>> component.provideAdapter(schema,
    ...                         provides=atifaces.ISchema,
    ...                         adapts=(MockFile,))

    >>> file1 = MockFile('foo')

Since our file instance still doesn't provide IAudioEnhanced the
adapter lookup will return None.

    >>> atct.ATCTFileAudio(file1) is None
    True

Now we audio enhance it and do a query of the audio items.

    >>> interface.alsoProvides(file1, interfaces.IAudioEnhanced)
    >>> testfolder.aq_explicit = testfolder

    >>> newid = testfolder._setObject(file1.getId(), file1)
    >>> provider = atct.ATCTFolderAudioProvider(testfolder)
    >>> provider.audio_items
    [<p4a.audio ATCTFileAudio title=>]

We can also lookup audio information on this folder.  But since the folder
hasn't been marked as ``IAudioContainerEnhanced`` lookup will return None.

    >>> containeraudio = atct.ATCTFolderAudioContainer(testfolder)
    >>> containeraudio is None
    True

So now we have to mark the interface.

    >>> interface.alsoProvides(testfolder,
    ...                        interfaces.IAudioContainerEnhanced,
    ...                        IAttributeAnnotatable)
    >>> containeraudio = atct.ATCTFolderAudioContainer(testfolder)
    >>> containeraudio
    <p4a.audio ATCTFolderishAudio title=>

And now we setup some mock smart folder (topic) content that we can test
with.

    >>> testtopic = MockTopic('testtopic')
    >>> newid = testtopic._setObject(file1.getId(), file1)

    >>> provider = atct.ATCTTopicAudioProvider(testtopic)
    >>> provider.audio_items
    [<p4a.audio ATCTFileAudio title=>]

We can also lookup audio information on this smart folder.  But since the
smart folder hasn't been marked as ``IAudioContainerEnhanced`` lookup will
return None.

    >>> containeraudio = atct.ATCTTopicAudioContainer(testtopic)
    >>> containeraudio is None
    True

So now we have to mark the interface.

    >>> interface.alsoProvides(testtopic,
    ...                        interfaces.IAudioContainerEnhanced,
    ...                        IAttributeAnnotatable)
    >>> containeraudio = atct.ATCTTopicAudioContainer(testtopic)
    >>> containeraudio
    <p4a.audio ATCTFolderishAudio title=>

One last content type we provide the audio container functionality for is
the (disabled by default) ATCT btree folder.

    >>> atct.ATCTBTreeFolderAudioContainer(None) is None
    True

    >>> containeraudio = atct.ATCTBTreeFolderAudioContainer(testfolder)
    >>> containeraudio
    <p4a.audio ATCTFolderishAudio title=>

Loading and Storing Metadata
----------------------------

First we need to make sure a mock data accessor adapter is available.

    >>> files_loaded = []
    >>> files_stored = []
    >>> class MockDataAccessor(object):
    ...     def __init__(self, context): self.context = context
    ...     def load(self, filename): files_loaded.append(filename)
    ...     def store(self, filename): files_stored.append(filename)
    ...     audio_type = 'mock_type'

    >>> component.provideAdapter(MockDataAccessor,
    ...                          provides=interfaces.IAudioDataAccessor,
    ...                          adapts=(interface.Interface,),
    ...                          name=u'text/plain')

Next we instruct the audio item to load it's audio metdata.

    >>> audio = atct.ATCTFileAudio(file1)
    >>> audio._load_audio_metadata()
    >>> len(files_loaded)
    1

And then we need the audio item to save it's audio metadata back.

    >>> component.provideAdapter(MockDataAccessor,
    ...                          provides=interfaces.IAudioDataAccessor,
    ...                          adapts=(interface.Interface,),
    ...                          name=u'application/octet-stream')
    >>> audio._save_audio_metadata()
    >>> len(files_stored)
    1

There is also an event handler for automatically kicking the loading of
metadata.

    >>> atct.load_metadata(audio, None)

And when a file object changes there is a synchronization event handler
that tries to make sure the content is sane.

    >>> from zope.app.event import objectevent
    >>> class MockEvent(object):
    ...     descriptions = [objectevent.Attributes(interfaces.IAudio,
    ...                                            'title', 'file')]
    >>> atct.sync_audio_metadata(audio, MockEvent())

Attempting Media Activation
---------------------------

There is an event handler which tries to automatically activate media
on modified objects.

But first we need to setup a test request and register our view component.

    >>> from zope.publisher.browser import TestRequest
    >>> file1.REQUEST = TestRequest()

    >>> from p4a.audio.browser import media
    >>> component.provideAdapter(media.ToggleEnhancementsView,
    ...                          adapts=(interface.Interface,
    ...                                  TestRequest),
    ...                          provides=interface.Interface,
    ...                          name=u'media-config.html')
    >>> from p4a.audio.media import MediaActivator
    >>> component.provideAdapter(MediaActivator)

    >>> view = media.ToggleEnhancementsView(file1, file1.REQUEST)
    >>> view.media_activated
    False

Since it's false, lets go ahead and try doing activation.

    >>> atct.attempt_media_activation(file1, None)

At this point we've never made our file1 object provide IPossibleAudio
so even though it's marked as IAudioEnhanced, the feature property checks
for both.

    >>> interface.alsoProvides(file1, interfaces.IPossibleAudio)
    >>> view.media_activated
    True

Now we can try activation again.

    >>> atct.attempt_media_activation(file1, None)

And now we try to produce some error being raised within the adapter lookup
call.

    >>> file2 = file.ATFile('file2')
    >>> file2.get_content_type = lambda: 'nadda'
    >>> file2.REQUEST = file1.REQUEST
    >>> interface.alsoProvides(file2, interfaces.IPossibleAudio)
    >>> atct.attempt_media_activation(file2, None)

DataAccessor I18N Convenience Functionality
-------------------------------------------

Ensure the default charset can be retrieved on the previous adapter.  First
we'll make sure it gets whatever the DEFAULT_CHARSET constant is set at.

    >>> audio._default_charset == atct.DEFAULT_CHARSET
    True

Now we setup the charset as it gets retrieved via Plone.

    >>> class MockProperties: pass
    >>> propstool = MockProperties()
    >>> propstool.site_properties = MockProperties()
    >>> propstool.site_properties.default_charset = 'foobar'
    >>> audio.context.portal_properties = propstool

Due to the fact that the charset will have already been cached, we need
to manually remove the cache value and try.

    >>> del audio._cached_default_charset
    >>> audio._default_charset
    'foobar'

And now we try once more to make sure the caching worked (we delete
the tool so if caching wasn't working we would get DEFAULT_CHARSET).

    >>> del audio.context.portal_properties
    >>> audio._default_charset
    'foobar'

And of course we make a simple _u() call (need to delete the cached charset
first or else it'll try decoding using the 'foobar' charset).

    >>> del audio._cached_default_charset
    >>> audio._u('foo')
    u'foo'

Misc DataAccessor Stuff
-----------------------

Make sure setting and getting the file attribute works properly (uses
properties at the moment).

    >>> audio.file
    <File at foo/file>

When we set the file directly it actually issues an upload command so
the string value becomes the file object value.

    >>> audio.file = 'foo'
    >>> audio.file
    <File at foo/file>

In it's starting condition, the ``audio_image`` field will have no value.

    >>> audio.audio_image is None
    True

So we start by trying to set the value to a value we know will get ignored.

    >>> audio.audio_image = interfaces.IAudio['audio_image'].missing_value
    >>> audio.audio_image is None
    True

The image value can be of instance OFSImage.

    >>> from OFS import Image as ofsimage
    >>> audio.audio_image = ofsimage.Image('someid', 'sometitle', 'filecontent')
    >>> audio.audio_image
    <Image at someid>

If it isn't of type OFSImage, the setter will automatically create
one based on the value provided (the value is expected to be file-like).

    >>> from StringIO import StringIO
    >>> sio = StringIO('foo')
    >>> sio.filename = 'nofilenameset'
    >>> audio.audio_image = sio
    >>> audio.audio_image
    <Image at nofilenameset>

And now we do a quick check to see what the ``audio_type`` is.

    >>> audio.audio_type
    'mock_type'

Feature Event Handling
----------------------

Whenever a feature has been activated we have an event handler that
listens.  It helps ensure that the audio container view is setup properly
on a container that has had it's layout changed.

    >>> from p4a.common.interfaces import FeatureActivatedEvent
    >>> evt = FeatureActivatedEvent(interfaces.IAudioContainerEnhanced,
    ...                             testfolder)
    >>> hasattr(testfolder, 'layout')
    False
    >>> testfolder.layout = 'changed'
    >>> hasattr(testfolder, 'layout')
    True
    >>> atct.feature_activated(evt)
    >>> hasattr(testfolder, 'layout')
    False
