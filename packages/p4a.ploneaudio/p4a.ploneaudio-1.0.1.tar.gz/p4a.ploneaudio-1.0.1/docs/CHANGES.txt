  http://plone4artists.org/p4aaIntro1.mov [Jonathan Lewis]

Features
--------

* Image and file widgets now show the existing file that has been uploaded.
  [Jim Mastro]

* Audio container now has additional metadata fields (artist, year, genre,
  cover art image) [Nate Aune]

* Audio files now can have a track number (which is extracted from ID3),
  and files are automatically sorted in track listing. [Vincenzo Barone]

* Artist and genre indexes are added to the portal_catalog, so you can use
  the customsearch product to search for all songs by a particular artist,
  or all songs of a particular genre. [Nate Aune]

* Artist and genre are added to the SearchableText index so that you can search 
  for the artist or genre using Plone's built-in search tool. [Jim Mastro]

* Artist and genre are added to the Smart Folder indexes so that you 
  can create smart folders using artist and genre id as criteria. [Nate Aune]

* Internationalized Plone4ArtistsAudio with i18n message ids, so that it 
  can be translated into other languages. Added Japanese translation.
  [Jonathan Lewis]

* Description field now works as expected and description is added to 
  SearchableText so when you search for audio files, it will look in the audio
  file's description field. [Nate Aune / Rocky Burt]


Bugfixes
---------

* Fixed #17: Media is not activated when uploaded via WebDAV/FTP. Added
  new event to listen for when attempting media activation. This allows
  automatic activation to occur for WebDAV but requires a recent
  Archetypes 1.4 version (currently svn r7371). Will be available in
  Plone 2.5.3+. [Rocky Burt]

* Fixed #25: Large folder (BTreeFolder) support is now fixed.

=====================================

Features
--------

* Audio support can now be activated/deactivated by using the
  quickinstaller to install/uninstall the product

* Menu item in actions dropdown now shows either "activate" audio or 
  "deactivate" audio depending on the state of the current context
