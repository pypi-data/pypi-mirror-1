Description: A storage implementation which uses RAM to persist objects, much like
        MappingStorage.  Unlike MappingStorage, it needs not be packed to get rid of
        non-cyclic garbage and it does rudimentary conflict resolution.  This is a
        ripoff of Jim's Packless bsddb3 storage.
