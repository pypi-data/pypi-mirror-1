Start and End Coinciding
------------------------

If a line of text matches both a "start" and "end" regular expression, no
exception should be raised.

    >>> source = """\
    ... Blah, blah.
    ... 
    ... xxx
    ... some text
    ... xxx
    ...
    ... """
    >>> import manuel
    >>> document = manuel.Document(source)
    >>> import re
    >>> start = end = re.compile(r'^xxx$', re.MULTILINE)
    >>> document.find_regions(start, end)
    [<manuel.Region object at ...]
