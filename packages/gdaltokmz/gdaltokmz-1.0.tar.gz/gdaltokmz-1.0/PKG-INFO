Description: 
        gdaltokmz allows converting from any GDAL-supported raster geographic
        format to the KMZ format used by the free Google Earth visualization
        tool.
        
        To perform the conversion, call::
        
        gdaltokmz.convert_gdal_to_kmz(gdalfile,kmzfile)
        
        Where gdalfile is the path to the input file, and kmzfile is the name
        of the file to be output.
        
        This module requires that the gdal and osr python modules be installed.
        More information on these can be found at http://www.gdal.org.
        
        This module requires the presence of ImageMagick's "convert" tool. Its
        location is hardcoded into the library as /usr/lib/convert; make sure
        to change it if your copy lives somewhere else (e.g., on a Windows
        machine). See http://www.imagemagick.org.
        
        To view the output files requires Google's free Google Earth program.
