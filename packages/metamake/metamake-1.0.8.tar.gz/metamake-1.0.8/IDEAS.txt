- when using make, if any task fails it does not fail the next one (chaining doesn't reveal broken build)
- Dependencies should allow the checking of other types of non-svn paths
- metamake should keep track of where other projects are storing the Dependency build output (path)
- if you specify revision for Dependency, then it becomes svn **export** instead
    
ADD:

    ShellCommandFailedError to the __init__ import of __all__
    

REMOVE:
    
    [noupdate=?] set to 'true' if you want to disable automatic Dependency version control updates


BUGS:
    
    if a directory name (e.g. "build") is the same as a target, then "make build" does not work (always thinks that "build is up to date")
