Description: Description
        ===========
        
        Metamake **is a simple way to define common tasks** and execute those tasks by
        name, similar to Rake.  Metamake **is not** a dependency-tracking build tool
        like Make, ant, qmake, SCons, Visual Studio, or XCode.  Metamake is used
        **with** these build tools to orchestrate complex builds that work in a
        cross-platform fashion.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Using Metamake is as easy as creating a 'Makefile.py' in your project
        directory::
        
        from metamake import task, shell, path
        
        @task
        def build():
        """builds the widget"""
        shell("qmake proj.pro -o Makefile.proj && make -f Makefile.proj")
        path("src/headers").copytree("dist/include")
        
        On the commandline, you can then type ``metamake ls`` to see a listing
        of all Metamake tasks defined in your Makefile.py, with their docstrings
        helpfully listed to describe the purpose of that task.
        
        Advanced Features
        =================
        
        Namespaces
        ----------
        
        To organize some of your tasks, you may want to namespace them::
        
        from metamake import task, namespace
        
        @namespace
        def mynamespace():
        
        @task
        def foo():
        """do something"""
        pass
        
        @task
        def bar():
        """do something else"""
        pass
        
        Then, when you list these tasks on the commandline, you will see::
        
        mynamespace:foo  # do something
        mynamespace:bar  # do something else
        
        
        Backwards-compatibility with Make
        ---------------------------------
        To make things easier on newcomers to Metamake, a "Makefile" can be
        created in your working directory that contains a bootstrapped version of
        Metamake inside.  This allows anybody to build your project without needing
        Metamake to be installed.  With the bootstrapped Makefile, you can type
        ``make <args>`` to achieve the same effect as ``metamake <args>``.  Whenever you
        update Metamake on your system, these bootstrapped Makefiles will be updated
        automatically next time you execute Metamake for that project.  You should
        commit these Makefiles to your repository so that other people can check out
        your project and build it without installing Metamake.  To create a Makefile
        bootstrap::
        
        from metamake import task, shell, bootstrap
        
        bootstrap("Makefile")
        
        # ...
        
        What if you already have a Makefile that you are using for other purposes?
        That's easy to solve, simply by specifying a different filename::
        
        from metamake import task, shell, bootstrap
        
        bootstrap("Makefile.meta")
        
        # ...
        
        Easy Commandline Flag Definition
        --------------------------------
        Metamake allows you to define commandline flags that can be passed
        into your build process.  These flags will work regardless of whether you use
        the 'metamake' tool or the bootstrapped Makefile::
        
        from metamake import task, Flag
        
        Flag("cleanfirst").explain("set this flag to 'true' to do a clean build")
        
        if Flag("cleanfirst").given:
        print "flag was given"
        
        if Flag("cleanfirst").value == "true":
        print "flag value was True"
        
        When you execute ``metamake ls`` on the commandline, you will see these flags
        listed underneath all of the task definitions, with the explanation that
        you provided as documentation.
        
        From the first example, asking if the value is "true" or "false" is a bit unweildy
        for a boolean value.  This gets even worse for flags that take a restricted set of
        values, for example a range of integers.  The ``explain`` method can take a few
        more parameters to help you out here::
        
        from metamake import task, Flag
        
        Flag("debuglevel").explain("set the debug level", convert=int, allow=[1,2,3,4])
        
        if Flag("debuglevel").value == 3:
        print "flag was converted to the integer 3"
        
        You can also grab the Flag instance instead of always referring to the
        string name::
        
        from metamake import task, Flag
        
        cleanflag = Flag("cleanfirst")
        debugflag = Flag("debuglevel")
        
        if cleanflag.given and debugflag.value == 3:
        print "we just checked the flag instances"
        
        
        Readable, Cross-platform Filesystem Manipulation
        ------------------------------------------------
        Jason Orendorff's excellent `path.py <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/path.py/>`_
        library unifies all of the cross-platform Python filesystem manipulations
        under a single object called **path**::
        
        from metamake import task, path
        
        @task
        def build():
        """builds the widget"""
        path("dist/include").makedirs()
        path("src/widget").copytree("dist/include/widget")
        for header_file in path("src/gadget").listdir("*.h"):
        header_file.copyfile("dist/include/gadget/%s" % header_file.basename())
        
        Metamake extends Jason's library by providing console logging for file operations.
        This makes it easy to see the manipulations that are happening to your filesystem
        on the commandline.
