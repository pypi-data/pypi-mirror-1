- when using make, if any task fails it does not fail the next one (chaining doesn't reveal broken build)
- Dependencies should allow the checking of other types of non-svn paths
- metamake should keep track of where other projects are storing the Dependency build output (path)
- if you specify revision for Dependency, then it becomes svn **export** instead
