Description: repoze.what.plugins.ini -- Plugin for repoze.what authorization framework
        =========================================================================
        
        What is repoze.what.plugins.ini?
        --------------------------------
        
        repoze.what.plugins.ini is a plugin for repoze.what that offers group and
        permissions adapters for sources based on INI files.
        
        
        What is repoze.what?
        --------------------
        
        From repoze.what site:
        
        repoze.what is an authorization framework for WSGI applications, based
        on repoze.who (which deals with authentication).
        
        On the one hand, it enables an authorization system based on the groups
        to which the authenticated or anonymous user belongs and the permissions
        granted to such groups by loading these groups and permissions into the
        request on the way in to the downstream WSGI application.
        
        And on the other hand, it enables you to manage your groups and
        permissions from the application itself or another program, under a
        backend-independent API. For example, it would be easy for you to switch
        from one back-end to another, and even use this framework to migrate the
        data.
        
        repoze.what can be used as authorization framework for turbogear, repoze.bfg
        or your own WSGI server.
        
        
        How to install repoze.what.plugins.ini?
        ---------------------------------------
        
        You can install the last stable version with easy_install::
        
        
        easy_install repoze.what.plugins.ini
        
        
        or the developer version via git::
        
        
        git clone git://github.com/jdinuncio/repoze.what.plugins.ini.git
        cd repoze.what.plugins.ini
        python setup.py install
        
        
        The source file format
        ----------------------
        
        The format used in the source files is similar to the INI file format. The
        file consists in a serie of sections, each one with a section header of the
        form “[section-name]”, followed by entries of the form “value”. Spaces
        before and after section headers or entries are ignored. Characters after
        ”#” are ignored.
        
        An example of a group file::
        
        
        [admins]
        rms
        
        [developers]
        rms
        linus
        
        [trolls]
        sballmer
        
        [python]
        [php]
        
        
        An example of a permissions file:
        
        
        [see-site]
        trolls
        
        [edit-site]
        admins
        developers
        
        [commit]
        developers
        
        
        How to use it?
        --------------
        
        All you need to do is to instantiate a repoze.what middleware using
        repoze.what.plugins.ini.INIGroupAdapter or
        repoze.what.plugins.ini.INIPermissionsAdapter::
        
        
        # First, we'll need a WSGI application
        my_app = None   # Of course, you'll change None for your WSGI app
        
        # We need to set up the repoze.who components used by repoze.what for
        # authentication
        from repoze.who.plugins.htpasswd import HTPasswdPlugin, crypt_check
        from repoze.who.plugins.basicauth import BasicAuthPlugin
        
        htpasswd = HTPasswdPlugin('passwd', crypt_check)
        basicauth = BasicAuthPlugin('MyRepoze')
        identifiers = [('basicauth', basicauth)]
        authenticators = [('htpasswd', htpasswd)]
        challengers = [('basicauth', basicauth)]
        mdproviders = []
        
        # We'll use group and permission based exclusively on INI files
        from repoze.what.plugins.ini import INIGroupAdapter
        from repoze.what.plugins.ini import INIPermissionsAdapter
        
        groups = {'all_groups': INIGroupAdapter('groups.ini')}
        permissions = {'all_perms': INIPermissionsAdapter('permissions.ini')}
        
        # Finally, we create the repoze.what middleware
        import logging
        
        from repoze.what.middleware import setup_auth
        
        middleware = setup_auth(
        app = my_app,
        group_adapters = groups,
        permission_adapters = permissions,
        identifiers = identifiers,
        authenticators = authenticators,
        challengers = challengers,
        mdproviders = mdproviders,
        log_level = logging.DEBUG
        )
