Changelog for webcouturier.dropdownmenu

    (name of developer listed in brackets)

webcouturier.dropdownmenu 1.1.5

    - Made the package work in both Plone 3.0.x and Plone 3.1
      [spliter]

    - Got rid of buggy default skin's resetting in package's profile
      [spliter]

    - Look for 'path' in the global tabs data, if it's available then 
      it's used to get the object instead of trying to reconstruct it 
      from the url which fails in many cases.
      [fschulze]

    - Fixed plone.browserlayer to 1.0rc3 version. Later versions are for 
      Plone 3.1 and newer.
      [spliter]

webcouturier.dropdownmenu 1.1.4
    
    - Fixed the bug when you have could get the error in case your navigation 
      root differs from site root. In this case you could get 
      "'NoneType' object has no attribute 'endswith'" error
      [spliter]

webcouturier.dropdownmenu 1.1.3

    - Switched the package from using browser resource for the main 
      stylesheet. It's now in skins/ to follow main theme's colors
      better
      [spliter]

    - Added a workaround for objects that contain spaces in their ID's 
      [spliter]
      
    - Fixed the problem with images in the site's root
      [spliter]      
    
    - Only override the depth for navtree queries for the dropdown menus.
      The override for the path was a nop for the common case but would
      break for sites with a different navigation root.

    - Call constructor for base class in our DropdownMenuViewlet class. This
      removes some boilerplate code and makes sure everything is initialised
      properly.
      [wichert]
    
webcouturier.dropdownmenu 1.1

    - Dropdownmenu uses it's own builder now (instead of sharing the same one
      with site map). Implemented new property ``dropdownDepth`` to contain
      depth property for dropdown menu separately from ``sitemapDepth``.
      [spliter]

    - Fixed the problem with installation in Plone 3.0.2 because of relations
      with webstats.js file
      [spliter]    

    
webcouturier.dropdownmenu 1.0

    - Initial release. Tested in all modern browsers, incl. Safari, IE6, IE7
      and so on.
