Changelog for webcouturier.dropdownmenu

    (name of developer listed in brackets)

webcouturier.dropdownmenu 1.1

    - Dropdownmenu uses it's own builder now (instead of sharing the same one
      with site map). Implemented new property ``dropdownDepth`` to contain
      depth property for dropdown menu separately from ``sitemapDepth``.

    - Fixed the problem with installation in Plone 3.0.2 because of relations
      with webstats.js file
