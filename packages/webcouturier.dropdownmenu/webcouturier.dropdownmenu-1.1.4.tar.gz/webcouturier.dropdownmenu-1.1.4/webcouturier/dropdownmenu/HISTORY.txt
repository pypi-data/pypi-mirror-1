    - Only override the depth for navtree queries for the dropdown menus.
      The override for the path was a nop for the common case but would
      break for sites with a different navigation root.

    - Call constructor for base class in our DropdownMenuViewlet class. This
      removes some boilerplate code and makes sure everything is initialised
      properly.
