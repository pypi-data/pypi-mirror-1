    The strapline is taken from the site title. If you wish to change what displays here, add your own content in here or 
    create a page template in the portal_skins/custom folder of your site in the ZMI called "strapline" with your content and reference it:
    "structure here/strapline" (instead of "here/portal_url/Title")
