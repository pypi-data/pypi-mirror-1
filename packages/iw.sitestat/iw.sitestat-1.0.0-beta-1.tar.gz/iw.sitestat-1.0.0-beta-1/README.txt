iw.sitestat
===========

By Ingeniweb_.

`iw.sitestat` makes the glue between a Plone site and a Sitestat
professional analytics service. The Sitestat product is a commercial
application from `Nedstat <http://www.nedstat.com>`_.

We assume at that point that your Sitestat product is correctly
installed and configured.

Note that the authors of `iw.sitestat` have no connection with the
Nedstat company.

Requirements
============

* `iw.sitestat` requires Plone 3.1 or newer.
* `simplejson` is added automatically by easy_install/zc.buildout.

Installation
============

We assume that you created your Zope instance with **paster create -t
plone3_buildout <your-instance>** or something similar. And of course
you're supposed to know how to set up a Plone site using zc.buildout.


With zc.buildout
----------------

Recommended practice for integration or production instances.

Open `buildout.cfg` with your favorite text editor and change it like
indicated below::

  [instance]
  ...
  eggs =
    ...
    iw.sitestat
    ...
  zcml =
    ...
    iw.sitestat

Run your buildout, you're done.

From Subversion repository
--------------------------

Recommended practice for developers.

Install as indicated in `With zc.buildout`_ above.

Checkout your preferred trunk/branch of `iw.sitestat` in $BUILDOUT/src
(You should have $BUILDOUT/src/iw.sitestat/... after this). See
the `Project home pages`_ section for the repository URL.

Then::

  $ cd $BUILDOUT/src/iw.sitestat
  $ python setup.py develop

Open `buildout.cfg` with your favorite text editor and change it like
indicated below::

  [buildout]
  ...
  develop =
    src/iw.sitestat

Run your buildout, you're done. Your Subversion working copy of
`iw.sitestat` should take over the egg.

Limitations
===========

At this stage of development, we do not yet honour the following
Sitestat features:

* Adobe Flash decoration support.
* Forms decoration support.

Project home pages
==================

* At plone.org: http://plone.org/products/iw.sitestat
* At pypi: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/iw.sitestat
* Subversion repository: https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/iw.sitestat

Upgrades
========

Visit in ZMI the `portal_setup` object of your site, click `Upgrades`
and select `iw.sitestat:default`. All is obvious from there.

Support
=======

As stated above, we will *never* provide support on sitestat services,
or whatever that's covered by sitestat commercial support. We only
support `iw.sitestat` itself.

Tracker
-------

You may report bugs or ask for features in our tracker. See the
"tracker" link from the project home page at plone.org.

Please read the rules written in the home page of the tracker before
reporting in the tracker. More specifically, please check that there
is no answer to your issue before filing anything.

Others
------

You may ask for further support (training, commercial support, ...) at
`Ingeniweb support <support@ingeniweb.com>`_ if you don't find answers
to your questions in the tracker.

Further documentation
=====================

See the other files in docs/\*. In addition this component may have
other more specific `README.txt` files in its directory tree.

More technical documentation may be found in
thisdir/iw/sitestat/tests/\*.txt.

Misc
====

About LinguaPlone
-----------------

We do not know if `iw.sitestat` is LinguaPlone compliant. As
LinguaPlone is supposed to override standard Plone and Archetypes
APIs, we do not consider the issues raised when mixing LinguaPlone and
`iw.sitestat` in the same site as `iw.sitestat` bugs. Anyway,
sponsorship and contributions are welcome to get all this working
fine.
