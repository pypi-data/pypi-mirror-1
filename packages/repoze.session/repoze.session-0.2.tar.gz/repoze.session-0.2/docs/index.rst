repoze.session
==============

:mod:`repoze.session` is a library that can be used to store and
retrieve :term:`session` data in a web application.  It relies on
:term:`ZODB` for its data storage.  Most of its internals are taken
from The :term:`faster` product for Zope2.  Unlike The ``faster``
product, however, it is meant to be useful outside of the larger Zope
2 framework within arbitrary Python web applications.
