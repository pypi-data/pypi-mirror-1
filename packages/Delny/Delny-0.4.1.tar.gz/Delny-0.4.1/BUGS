Known issues
============

* Some sets might fail to triangulate.  For example the square from
  the delaunay/test/test_qhull.py script.  Problems can only occur
  when having non-simplical facets (but don't have to), so normally
  everything will work.  With a bit of luck this problem might get
  solved reasonable soon.

* Test failure in test__qhull.py:
  TestPredictedOutputs2D.test_three_by_three_sqare.  This produces
  non-simplical facets even tough we asked for triangulated output
  (Qt).  This is a bug that hasn't been solved yet.
