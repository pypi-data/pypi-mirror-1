Coding Style
============

In general try and follow the PEP's.  In particular these are:

* PEP 7 for C code
   Exeptions:
    - When splitting lines the operators go in the *beginning of the
      next* line.
    - The naming conventions can be mostly ignored as this is not a
      stdlib module, follow the GNU coding standards instead.
    - Maybe also stick to GNU standards for indentation?

* PEP 8 for python code
* PEP 257 tells about docstrings

All PEP's can be found on http://python.org/peps.
