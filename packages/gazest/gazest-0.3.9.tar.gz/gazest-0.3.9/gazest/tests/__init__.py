"""Pylons application test package

When the test runner finds and executes tests within this directory,
this file will be loaded to setup the test environment.

It registers the root directory of the project in sys.path and
pkg_resources, in case the project hasn't been installed with
setuptools. It also initializes the application via websetup (paster
setup-app) with the project's test.ini configuration file.
