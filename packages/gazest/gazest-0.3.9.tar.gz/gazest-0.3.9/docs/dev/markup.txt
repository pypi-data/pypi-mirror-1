Markup is based on Markdown for formating and loosly based on MediaWiki
for wiki stuff.

Central to Gazest are the concept of tags and section.  A tag will
mean different things depending on where it is linked from.

Inspiration: http://www.wikimatrix.org/syntax.php

The syntax is not nested so it can be implemented with regexps.  

   - pages have versions
   - simple MediaWiki style of markup
   - {{function arg1 arg2}}
   - [[tagname]]

   - [[[...]]]: Intermediate internal form.  You can expect the hell
     to break loose if something like that is already in the page when
     we process it.

   - tags have sections
   - name spaces
   - "page kind" list required sections
   - some sections are automatic, like comment or rating
   - per namespace edit policy
   - some page kinds force actions like captcha or preview before post
