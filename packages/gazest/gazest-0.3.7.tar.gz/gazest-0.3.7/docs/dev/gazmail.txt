Gazmails and electronic mails between Gazest users.  We use the name
Gazmail to prevent confusion with SMTP style of emails, which are also
used in Gazest.  Those are plain personnal messages like those seen in
many forum engines.

Rough design is as follow:

   sender status: new -> draft -> sent
                      -> sent

   reader status: new -> read -> deleted
                      -> replied
                      -> important -> read
		      	 	   -> replied
				   -> spam
                      -> spam -> new
		  important is not a status, it's a flag
		  replied is not a status, it's a flag
		  spam is a status, is takes the mail out of the system
