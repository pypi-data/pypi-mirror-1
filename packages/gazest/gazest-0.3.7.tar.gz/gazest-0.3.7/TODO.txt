Stuff that has to be done
-------------------------

 - Many ugly hacks shameless omissions should be fixed.  Most are
   properly tagged so we can find them with

   $ grep FIXME -r gazest
   $ grep TODO -r gazest

 - better web design

 - We have all what it takes to do whole namespace branch and merge
   but I have yet to come with a user friendly UI for it.  The use
   case is: we select a handful of pages, branch them into a new
   namespace, hack them, save them, hack them some more, and what we
   are ready, merge the whole namespace back into place.

 - The conflict resolution UI is really bad

 - more macros:
   - images
   - code blocks with syntax highlighting
   - Reddit style votable items
   - discussion threads: all pages need one on the side like on
     MediaWiki but we might want to include another discussion in the
     page body

 - spam checks

 - optional captchas

 - check passwords with

 - HTML escape all usernames and stuff like that

 - Gazmail sucks: maybe we can fix it with a bit of CSS and Mako
   tweaks but we might have to rethink it from scratch

 - PAM authentication
