plone.portlet.static Installation
=================================

If you are using zc.buildout:

 * Add ``plone.portlet.static`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:
 
    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        plone.portlet.static
        
  * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug:
  
    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        plone.portlet.static

If you are using traditional instances or a workingenv:

 * When you're reading this you have probably already run 
   ``easy_install plone.portlet.static``. Find out how to install setuptools
   (and EasyInstall) here:
   http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall

 * Create a file called ``plone.portlet.static-configure.zcml`` in the
   ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
   should only contain this::

       <include package="plone.portlet.static" />

Before you can use the portlet, you must install it from Plone's 
``Add-on products`` control panel.
