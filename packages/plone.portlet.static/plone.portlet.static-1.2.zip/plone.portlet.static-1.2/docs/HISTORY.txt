Changelog
=========

1.2 - 2009-11-25
----------------

- Ensure that text output is passed through the safe-html transform to protect
  against malicious text. This also ensures the resolve uid behavior works when
  only TinyMCE and not Kupu is installed.
  [hannosch]

- Removed msgids in portlets.xml. There is no support for
  msgids in the import of portlets.xml implementation.
  This allows to extract translatable strings with i18ndude.

- Added transform to resolve uids.
