Description: ===========
        PyConBrasil
        ===========
        
        This software was writen to manage the papers and registration for
        PyConBrasil, the Brazilian Python Conference.
        
        It doesn't means, though, that you can't use it to manage you're own
        conference! :o)
        
        The motivation to start this product came from the insistency of Erico
        Andrei, in the first preparation meeting for the II PyConBrasil (2006),
        where he stated that we should do it in Python and make it available
        to everyone who did the registration in the event.
        
        And he was right about it... ;-)
