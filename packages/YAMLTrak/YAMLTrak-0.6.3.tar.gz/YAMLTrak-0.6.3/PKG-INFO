Description: YAMLTrak provides a library and a command line interface to a YAML based
        issue tracker. Provides advanced features like auto-linking of edited
        files and issues, the ability to guess which issue you're working on, and
        burndown charts (in the library).  All of this in a distributed version
        control system, so issue changes follow code changes, and you always have
        an up to date view of your project.
