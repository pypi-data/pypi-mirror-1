Description: ``zope.dublincore`` provides a Dublin Core support for Zope-based web
        applications.  This includes:
        
        * an ``IZopeDublinCore`` interface definition that can be implemented
        by objects directly or via an adapter to support DublinCore
        metadata.
        
        * an ``IZopeDublinCore`` adapter for annotatable objects (objects
        providing ``IAnnotatable`` from ``zope.annotation``).
        
        * a partial adapter for objects that already implement some of the
        ``IZopeDublinCore`` API,
        
        * a "Metadata" browser page (which by default appears in the ZMI),
        
        * subscribers to various object lifecycle events that automatically
        set the created and modified date and some other metadata.
        
        
        Changes
        =======
        
        3.6.0 (2009-12-02)
        ------------------
        
        - Removed the marker interface IZopeDublinCoreAnnotatable which doesn't seem
        to be used.
        
        - Made the registration of ZDCAnnotatableAdapter conditional, lifting the
        dependency on zope.annotation and thereby the ZODB, leaving it as a test
        dependency.
        
        3.5.0 (2009-09-15)
        ------------------
        
        - Add missing dependencies.
        
        - Get rid of any testing dependencies beyond zope.testing.
        
        - Include browser ZCML configuration only if zope.browserpage is installed.
        
        - Specify i18n domain in package's ``configure.zcml``, because we use message
        IDs for permission titles.
        
        - Remove unused imports, fix one test that was inactive because of being
        overriden by another one by a mistake.
        
        3.4.2 (2009-01-31)
        ------------------
        
        - Declare dependency on zope.datetime.
        
        3.4.1 (2009-01-26)
        ------------------
        
        - Test dependencies are declared in a `test` extra now.
        
        - Fix: Make CreatorAnnotator not to fail if participation principal is None
        
        3.4.0 (2007-09-28)
        ------------------

        --------------------
