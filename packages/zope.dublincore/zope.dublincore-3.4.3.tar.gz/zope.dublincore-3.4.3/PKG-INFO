Description: ``zope.dublincore`` provides a Dublin Core support for Zope-based web
        applications.  This includes:
        
        * an ``IZopeDublinCore`` interface definition that can be implemented
        by objects directly or via an adapter to support DublinCore
        metadata.
        
        * an ``IZopeDublinCore`` adapter for annotatable objects (objects
        providing ``IAnnotatable`` from ``zope.annotation``).
        
        * a partial adapter for objects that already implement some of the
        ``IZopeDublinCore`` API,
        
        * a "Metadata" browser page (which by default appears in the ZMI),
        
        * subscribers to various object lifecycle events that automatically
        set the created and modified date and some other metadata.
