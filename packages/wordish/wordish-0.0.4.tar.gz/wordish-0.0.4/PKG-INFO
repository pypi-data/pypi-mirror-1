Description: 
        Shells are applications often used by administrators or developers
        to carry out very diverse type of operations: the list is virtually
        boundless and includes, for example, disk management, network
        administration, source code version control, or application packaging
        and deployment. Documentation of shell operations are eased by the
        fact that a shell session is composed of text commands and outputs,
        which is easy to copy and paste, or to present orderly.
        
        Wordish is a project which parses a shell session from a documentation
        which contains the commands and the expected output, and verifies that
        they work exactly as shown, to make sure the documentation is
        correct.
        
        For example, if the file hello.txt is laid out like::
        
        ~$ cat hello.txt
        echo "Hello World"
        Hello World
        
        The shell session can be test with::
        
        ~$ python -m wordish hello.txt
        
        The report will show::
        
        Trying:       echo "hello world"
        Expecting:    hello world
        ok
        
        1 tests found.
        All tests passed
        
        *Wordish can test wordy shell articles*
