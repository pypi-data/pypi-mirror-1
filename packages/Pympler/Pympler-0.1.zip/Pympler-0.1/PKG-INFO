Description: 
        Pympler is a development tool to measure, monitor and analyze the
        memory behavior of Python objects in a running Python application.
        
        By pympling a Python application, detailed insight in the size and
        the lifetime of Python objects can be obtained.  Undesirable or
        unexpected runtime behavior like memory bloat and other "pymples"
        can easily be identified.
        
        Pympler integrates 3 previously separate modules into a single,
        comprehensive profiling tool.  The  asizeof module provides basic
        size information for one or several Python objects, module  muppy
        is used for on-line monitoring of a Python application and module
        heapmonitor provides off-line analysis of the lifetime of selected
        Python objects.
        
        Pympler is written entirely in Python, with no dependencies other
        than standard Python modules and libraries.  All Pympler modules
        work with Python 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6.  Module  asizeof has also been
        tested with Python 2.2, 2.3 and 3.0 on a number of Linux distros,
        MacOS X (10.4.11 Intel and 10.3.9 PPC), Solaris 10 (Opteron) and
        Windows XP with 32-bit and several 64-bit Python builds.
