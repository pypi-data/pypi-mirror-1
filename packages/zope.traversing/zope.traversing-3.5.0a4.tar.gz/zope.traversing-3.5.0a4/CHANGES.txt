3.5.0a4 (2008-08-01)
--------------------

- Updated (test) dependencies and tests to expect and work with a spec
  compliant TAL interpreter as available in zope.tal >= 3.5.0.
- Fixed deprecation warning caused by using an old module name for
  ZopeSecurityPolicy in ftesting.zcml
- Made sure traversing doesn't raise an TypeError but a TraversalError when the
  traversal step before yielded a string.


3.5.0a3 (2007-12-28)
--------------------

- backed out the controversial `++skin++` traverser for XML-RPC.


3.5.0a2 (2007-11-28)
--------------------

- ported 3.4.1a1 to trunk

  - Do not use unicode strings to set the application server in the virtual
    host namespace. This caused absolute_url to create unicode URL's.

- Added a traverer for ++skin++ for XMLRPC skins (IXMLRPCSkinType). This also
  means that the normal ++skin++ namespace handler is only bound to
  IBrowserRequest. 

- Resolved the dependency on zope.app.applicationcontrol by importing the
  application controller only if the package is available.


3.4.1a1 (2007-11-13)
--------------------

Do not use unicode strings to set the application server in the virtual host
namespace. This caused absolute_url to create unicode URL's.


3.4.0 (2007-09-29)
------------------

No further changes since 3.4.0a1.

3.4.0a1 (2007-04-22)
--------------------

Initial release as a separate project, corresponds to zope.traversing
from Zope 3.4.0a1
