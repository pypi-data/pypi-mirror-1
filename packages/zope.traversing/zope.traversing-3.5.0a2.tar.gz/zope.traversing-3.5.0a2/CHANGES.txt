3.5.0a2 (2007-11-28)
====================

- ported 3.4.1a1 to trunk
  - Do not use unicode strings to set the application server in the virtual
    host namespace. This caused absolute_url to create unicode URL's.

- Added a traverer for ++skin++ for XMLRPC skins (IXMLRPCSkinType). This also
  means that the normal ++skin++ namespace handler is only bound to
  IBrowserRequest. 

- Resolved the dependency on zope.app.applicationcontrol by importing the
  application controller only if the package is available.
