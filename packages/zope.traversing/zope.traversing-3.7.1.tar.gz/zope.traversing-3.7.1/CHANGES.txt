3.7.1 (2009-06-16)
------------------

- AbsoluteURL now implements the fact that __call__ returns the same as __str__
  in a manner that it applies for subclasses, too, so they only have to override
  __str__ and not both.

3.7.0 (2009-05-23)
------------------

- Moved the publicationtraverse module to zope.traversing, removing the
  zope.app.publisher -> zope.app.publication dependency (which was a
  cycle).

- Look up the application controller through a utility registration
  rather than a direct reference.


3.6.0 (2009-04-06)
------------------

- Change configure.zcml to not depend on zope.app.component.

- This release includes the BBB-incompatible ``zope.publisher.skinnable``
  change from 3.5.3.


3.5.4 (2009-04-06)
------------------

- Revert BBB-incompatible use of ``zope.publisher.skinnable``:  that
  change belongs in a 3.6.0 release, because it requires a BBB-incompatible
  version of ``zope.publisher``.


3.5.3 (2009-03-10)
------------------

- Use applySkin from new location. zope.publisher.skinnable instead of
  zope.publisher.browser.

- Use IAbsoluteURL lookup instead of the "absolute_url" view in the
  recursive AbsoluteURL adapters (LP: #338101).

3.5.2 (2009-02-04)
------------------

- The RootPhysicallyLocatable is not the same as LocationPhysicallyLocatable
  now in zope.location. Fix the import and testing setups.

3.5.1 (2009-02-02)
------------------

- The ``RootPhysicallyLocatable`` adapter has been superseded by the
  refactored ``zope.location.traversing.LocationPhysicallyLocatable``
  that we depend on since 3.5.0a4.

  Remove the adapter and its registration, and making its import place
  pointing to ``zope.location.traversing.LocationPhysicallyLocatable``
  to maintain backward-compatibility.

  This also fixes a bug introduced in version 3.5.0a4 when trying to
  call ``getParents`` function for the root object.

- Use direct imports instead of compatibility ones for things that were
  moved to ``zope.location``.

- Remove the ``zope.traversing.interfaces.INamespaceHandler`` interface,
  as it seems not to be used for years.

- Change package's mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org instead
  of retired zope3-dev at zope.org

3.5.0 (2009-01-31)
------------------

- Use zope.container instead of zope.app.container.

- Use zope.site instead of zope.app.folder in the unit tests.

- Reduced, but did not eliminate, test dependencies on zope.app.component.

3.5.0a4 (2008-08-01)
--------------------

- Reverse dependencies between zope.location and zope.traversing.

- Updated (test) dependencies and tests to expect and work with a spec
  compliant TAL interpreter as available in zope.tal >= 3.5.0.
- Fixed deprecation warning caused by using an old module name for
  ZopeSecurityPolicy in ftesting.zcml
- Made sure traversing doesn't raise an TypeError but a TraversalError when the
  traversal step before yielded a string.


3.5.0a3 (2007-12-28)
--------------------

- backed out the controversial `++skin++` traverser for XML-RPC.


3.5.0a2 (2007-11-28)
--------------------

- ported 3.4.1a1 to trunk

  - Do not use unicode strings to set the application server in the virtual
    host namespace. This caused absolute_url to create unicode URL's.

- Added a traverer for ++skin++ for XMLRPC skins (IXMLRPCSkinType). This also
  means that the normal ++skin++ namespace handler is only bound to
  IBrowserRequest. 

- Resolved the dependency on zope.app.applicationcontrol by importing the
  application controller only if the package is available.


3.4.1a1 (2007-11-13)
--------------------

Do not use unicode strings to set the application server in the virtual host
namespace. This caused absolute_url to create unicode URL's.


3.4.0 (2007-09-29)
------------------

No further changes since 3.4.0a1.

3.4.0a1 (2007-04-22)
--------------------

Initial release as a separate project, corresponds to zope.traversing
from Zope 3.4.0a1
