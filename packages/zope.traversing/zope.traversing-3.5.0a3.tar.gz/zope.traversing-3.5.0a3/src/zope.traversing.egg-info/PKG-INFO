Description: The ``zope.traversing`` package provides adapteres for resolving
        object paths by traversing an object hierarchy.  This also includes
        support for traversal namespaces (e.g. ``++view++``, ``++skin++``,
        etc.) as well as computing URLs via the ``@@absolute_url`` view.

        Changes
        =======
        
        After 3.5.0a3 (unreleased)
        --------------------------
        
        
        3.5.0a3 (2007-12-28)
        --------------------
        
        - backed out the controversial `++skin++` traverser for XML-RPC.
        
        
        3.5.0a2 (2007-11-28)
        --------------------
        
        - ported 3.4.1a1 to trunk
        - Do not use unicode strings to set the application server in the virtual
        host namespace. This caused absolute_url to create unicode URL's.
        
        - Added a traverer for ++skin++ for XMLRPC skins (IXMLRPCSkinType). This also
        means that the normal ++skin++ namespace handler is only bound to
        IBrowserRequest.
        
        - Resolved the dependency on zope.app.applicationcontrol by importing the
        application controller only if the package is available.
        
        
        3.4.1a1 (2007-11-13)
        --------------------
        
        Do not use unicode strings to set the application server in the virtual host
        namespace. This caused absolute_url to create unicode URL's.
        
        
        3.4.0 (2007-09-29)
        ------------------
        
        No further changes since 3.4.0a1.
        
        3.4.0a1 (2007-04-22)
        --------------------
        
        Initial release as a separate project, corresponds to zope.traversing
        from Zope 3.4.0a1
