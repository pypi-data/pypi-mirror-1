Introduction
============

Additional Toolbar buttons to enable Emoticons for KUPU.

Products.Ploneboard is able to transform simple ASCII Smileys into nice
Emoticons. But the users need to know the exact string to type that it can be
transformed into an emoticon inside of KUPU.

For example::

    :) or :-) transformes to <img src="smiley_smile.png" alt=":)" title="Smile" />


Ok, you think "Everyone knows that!".... but there are People who do not know
that, because they are no Nerds;)

There we thought "why not add some additional buttons to KUPU which insert a
**:)** or **:-)**???"

So this little package was born...

Nice little story, huh?:)


WARNING:
--------

This package overwrites kupuinit.js and kupu_wysiwyg_support.html and is tested on Plone 3.1.4.

**Depending on the installed Plone/KUPU Version, this might break KUPU.**


NOTE:
-----

we are no KUPU core developers, so maybe there is a simpler way to do that.
Feedback is more than welcome...
