Introduction

PyPI Browser is a graphical user interface (GUI) browser for the Python Package
Index (PyPI) that aims to make it easier for users to find and download useful
Python software from a central repository. It provides facilities for searching
the package index, can display information about individual packages, allows
packages to be marked so that they can be downloaded together, and records
information about existing packages so that new ones can be highlighted.

To install the browser, run the setup.py script in a console with the
appropriate privileges by typing

  python setup.py install

Once installed, it should be possible to run the browser by typing
