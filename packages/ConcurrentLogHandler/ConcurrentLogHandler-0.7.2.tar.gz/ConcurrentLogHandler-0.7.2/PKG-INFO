Description: The ``ConcurrentRotatingFileHandler`` class is a drop-in replacement for
        Python's standard log handler ``RotateFileHandler``. This module uses file
        locking so that multiple processes can concurrently log to a single file without
        dropping or clobbering log records. This module provides a file rotation scheme
        like ``RotatingFileHanler``, except that extra care is taken to ensure that logs
        can be safely rotated before the rotation process is started. (This module works
        around the file rename issue with ``RotatingFileHandler`` on Windows, where a
        rotation failure means that all subsequent logs are lost).
        
        This module's attempts to preserve log records at all cost. This means that log
        files will grow larger than the specified maximum (rotation) size. So if disk
        space is tight, you may want to stick with ``RotatingFileHandler``, which will
        strictly adhere to the maximum file size.
