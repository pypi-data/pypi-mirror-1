Description: fcgiapp is a Python wrapper for the C FastCGI SDK.  It's used by PEAK's FastCGI servers to provide WSGI-over-FastCGI.  Originally created and maintained by Digital Creations (now Zope Corp.), it is now being maintained as one of PEAK's adopted "orphan" projects.  A POSIX-like operating system (Linux, Mac, Cygwin, etc.) is required, since Unix-domain socket use is hardwired in the original package.
Platform: Posix
Platform: Cygwin
