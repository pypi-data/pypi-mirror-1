   The _splicetee_ module is an interface to the splice() and tee() system calls
	 from the Python programming language.
   
   These system calls are Linux system calls to
	   * move data from a stream to another without need for user-space involvment
		   and with minimal (or no) copying.
		 * transfer data between two pipes without consuming the input.
       
	 Theses system calls are available on Linux 2.6.17 and higher.
   
Version

   The current version of the _splicetee_ module is 1.0.
	 I've only tried it on Linux 2.6.17.7.
