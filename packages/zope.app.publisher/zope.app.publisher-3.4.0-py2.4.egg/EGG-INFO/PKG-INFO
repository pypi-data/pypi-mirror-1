Description: ========
        Overview
        ========
        
        ``zope.publisher`` is a general purpose object publishing framework
        which delegates to a publication object for determining the
        to-be-published object.  With Zope 3's default publication from
        ``zope.app.publication``, this is usually a view or a resource.
        
        This package, ``zope.app.publisher``, provides base implementations
        for those.  It also provides ZCML directives for configuring views and
        resources.  More specifically, ``zope.app.publisher`` defines the
        following ZCML directives:
        
        * browser:page
        
        * browser:pages
        
        * browser:view
        
        * browser:menu
        
        * browser:menuItem
        
        * browser:menuItems
        
        * browser:addMenuitem
        
        * browser:resource
        
        * browser:resourceDirectory
        
        * browser:defeaultSkin
        
        * browser:icon
        
        * xmlrpc:view

        3.4.0 (2007-09-29)
        ==================
        
        No further changes since 3.4.0b2.
        
        3.4.0b2 (2007-08-23)
        ====================
        
        - <browser:defaultView> now accepts classes as well as interfaces.
        
        3.4.0b1 (2007-08-21)
        ====================
        
        - <browser:menuItem> can now be registered for classes (backport from 3.5)
        
        - Fixed a bug about xmlrpc:view: Omitting a permission was (widely)
        documented to be allowed when a name is given and should incorporate the
        original security settings of the view class. This did not work at all and
        the permission was always required. It now works as described.
        
        Before 3.4
