3.5.0 (???)
===========

3.5.0a3 (2007-11-27)
====================

- make it possible to override menus: this was not possible because new
  interfaces where created any time a menu with the same name was created.

- Resolve ``ZopeSecurityPolicy`` deprecation warning.

3.5.0a2 (2007-08-23)
====================

- <browser:defaultView> now accepts classes as well as interfaces.

3.5.0a1 (2007-08-21)
====================

- Added a `layer` attribute to `xmlrpc:view`. This works just like layers for
  `browser:view` etc. but uses the `IXMLRPCSkinType`.

3.4.0b1 (2007-08-21)
====================

- <browser:menuItem> can now be registered for classes

- Fixed a bug about xmlrpc:view: Omitting a permission was (widely)
  documented to be allowed when a name is given and should incorporate the
  original security settings of the view class. This did not work at all and
  the permission was always required. It now works as described.
