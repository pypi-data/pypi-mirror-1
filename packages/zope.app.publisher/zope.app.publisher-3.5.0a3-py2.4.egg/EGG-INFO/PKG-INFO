        Overview
        ========
        
        ``zope.publisher`` is a general purpose object publishing framework
        which delegates to a publication object for determining the
        to-be-published object.  With Zope 3's default publication from
        ``zope.app.publication``, this is usually a view or a resource.
        
        This package, ``zope.app.publisher``, provides base implementations
        for those.  It also provides ZCML directives for configuring views and
        resources.  More specifically, ``zope.app.publisher`` defines the
        following ZCML directives:
        
        * browser:page
        
        * browser:pages
        
        * browser:view
        
        * browser:menu
        
        * browser:menuItem
        
        * browser:menuItems
        
        * browser:addMenuitem
        
        * browser:resource
        
        * browser:resourceDirectory
        
        * browser:defeaultSkin
        
        * browser:icon
        
        * xmlrpc:view

        Changes
        =======
        
        3.5.0 (???)
        ===========
        
        3.5.0a3 (2007-11-27)
        ====================
        
        - make it possible to override menus: this was not possible because new
        interfaces where created any time a menu with the same name was created.
        
        - Resolve ``ZopeSecurityPolicy`` deprecation warning.
        
        3.5.0a2 (2007-08-23)
        ====================
        
        - <browser:defaultView> now accepts classes as well as interfaces.
        
        3.5.0a1 (2007-08-21)
        ====================
        
        - Added a `layer` attribute to `xmlrpc:view`. This works just like layers for
        `browser:view` etc. but uses the `IXMLRPCSkinType`.
        
        3.4.0b1 (2007-08-21)
        ====================
        
        - <browser:menuItem> can now be registered for classes
        
        - Fixed a bug about xmlrpc:view: Omitting a permission was (widely)
        documented to be allowed when a name is given and should incorporate the
        original security settings of the view class. This did not work at all and
        the permission was always required. It now works as described.
        
        Before 3.4
        ==========
        
        This package was part of the Zope 3 distribution and did not have its own
        CHANGES.txt. For earlier changes please refer to either our subversion log or
