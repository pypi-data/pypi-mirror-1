3.5.0a4 (2007-12-28)
====================

- Backed out the changes for the controversial XML-RPC skin support.

3.5.0a3 (2007-11-27)
====================

- make it possible to override menus: this was not possible because new
  interfaces where created any time a menu with the same name was created.

- Resolve ``ZopeSecurityPolicy`` deprecation warning.

3.5.0a2 (2007-08-23)
====================

- <browser:defaultView> now accepts classes as well as interfaces.

3.5.0a1 (2007-08-21)
====================

- Added a `layer` attribute to `xmlrpc:view`. This works just like layers for
  `browser:view` etc. but uses the `IXMLRPCSkinType`.
