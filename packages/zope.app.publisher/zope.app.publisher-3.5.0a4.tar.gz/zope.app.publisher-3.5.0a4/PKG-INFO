Description: ========
        Overview
        ========
        
        ``zope.publisher`` is a general purpose object publishing framework
        which delegates to a publication object for determining the
        to-be-published object.  With Zope 3's default publication from
        ``zope.app.publication``, this is usually a view or a resource.
        
        This package, ``zope.app.publisher``, provides base implementations
        for those.  It also provides ZCML directives for configuring views and
        resources.  More specifically, ``zope.app.publisher`` defines the
        following ZCML directives:
        
        * browser:page
        
        * browser:pages
        
        * browser:view
        
        * browser:menu
        
        * browser:menuItem
        
        * browser:menuItems
        
        * browser:addMenuitem
        
        * browser:resource
        
        * browser:resourceDirectory
        
        * browser:defeaultSkin
        
        * browser:icon
        
        * xmlrpc:view

        Changes
        =======
        
        3.5.0a4 (2007-12-28)
        ====================
        
        - Backed out the changes for the controversial XML-RPC skin support.
        
        3.5.0a3 (2007-11-27)
        ====================
        
        - make it possible to override menus: this was not possible because new
        interfaces where created any time a menu with the same name was created.
        
        - Resolve ``ZopeSecurityPolicy`` deprecation warning.
        
        3.5.0a2 (2007-08-23)
        ====================
        
        - <browser:defaultView> now accepts classes as well as interfaces.
        
        3.5.0a1 (2007-08-21)
        ====================
        
        - Added a `layer` attribute to `xmlrpc:view`. This works just like layers for
        `browser:view` etc. but uses the `IXMLRPCSkinType`.
