Description: ========
        Overview
        ========
        
        ``zope.publisher`` is a general purpose object publishing framework
        which delegates to a publication object for determining the
        to-be-published object.  With Zope 3's default publication from
        ``zope.app.publication``, this is usually a view or a resource.
        
        This package, ``zope.app.publisher``, provides base implementations
        for those.  It also provides ZCML directives for configuring views and
        resources.  More specifically, ``zope.app.publisher`` defines the
        following ZCML directives:
        
        * browser:page
        
        * browser:pages
        
        * browser:view
        
        * browser:menu
        
        * browser:menuItem
        
        * browser:menuItems
        
        * browser:addMenuitem
        
        * browser:resource
        
        * browser:resourceDirectory
        
        * browser:defeaultSkin
        
        * browser:icon
        
        * xmlrpc:view

        Changes
        =======
        
        3.6.2 (2009-03-18)
        ==================
        
        - Register ``IModifiableUserPreferredLanguages`` adapter in the ZCML
        configuration of ``zope.app.publisher.browser`` package. This was previously
        done by ``zope.app.i18n``.
        
        3.6.1 (2009-03-12)
        ==================
        
        - Remove deprecated code.
        
        - Adapt to removal of deprecated interfaces from zope.component.interfaces.
        The IResource is now moved to zope.app.publisher.interfaces. The IView
        and IDefaultViewName is now in zope.publisher.interfaces. The IPresentation
        interface was removed completely.
        
        3.6.0 (2009-01-31)
        ==================
        
        - Use zope.container instead of zope.app.container.
        
        - Use zope.site.folder instead of zope.app.folder.
        
        3.5.3 (2009-01-27)
        ==================
        
        - Finally removed <browser:skin> and <browser:layer> that were marked as
        deprecated in 2006/02.
        
        3.5.2 (2008-12-06)
        ==================
        
        - Added possibility to specify custom item class in menuItem, subMenuItem
        and addMenuItem directives using the ``item_class`` argument (LP #291865).
        
        - Menu items registered with <browser:page/> were not re-registered after the
        first functional test layer ran. In any subsequent functional test layer the
        items where not availabe (introduced in 3.5.0a3).
        
        - Added a hook to specify a different BaseURL for resources. This makes sense
        if you want to put resources on a Content Delivery Network. All you need to
        do is to register an named Adapter 'resource' that implements IAbsoluteURL.
        
        3.5.1 (2008-10-13)
        ==================
        
        - Removed usage of deprecated LayerField from zope.app.component.back35.
        
        3.5.0 (2008-08-05)
        ==================
        
        - Refactored code to provide more hooks when deriving code from this pacakge.
        
        * A resource's URL creation is now in its own method.
        
        * The resource class of factories can be overwritten.
        
        * The cache timeout value can now be set as a class or instance attribute.
        
        3.5.0a4 (2007-12-28)
        ====================
        
        - Backed out the changes for the controversial XML-RPC skin support.
        
        3.5.0a3 (2007-11-27)
        ====================
        
        - make it possible to override menus: this was not possible because new
        interfaces where created any time a menu with the same name was created.
        
        - Resolve ``ZopeSecurityPolicy`` deprecation warning.
        
        3.5.0a2 (2007-08-23)
        ====================
        
        - <browser:defaultView> now accepts classes as well as interfaces.
        
        3.5.0a1 (2007-08-21)
        ====================
        
        - Added a `layer` attribute to `xmlrpc:view`. This works just like layers for
        `browser:view` etc. but uses the `IXMLRPCSkinType`.
