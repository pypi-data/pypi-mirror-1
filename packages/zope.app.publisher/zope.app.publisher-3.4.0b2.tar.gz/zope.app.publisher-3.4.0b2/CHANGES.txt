3.4.0b2 (2007-08-23)
====================

- <browser:defaultView> now accepts classes as well as interfaces.

3.4.0b1 (2007-08-21)
====================

 - <browser:menuItem> can now be registered for classes (backport from 3.5)

 - Fixed a bug about xmlrpc:view: Omitting a permission was (widely)
   documented to be allowed when a name is given and should incorporate the
   original security settings of the view class. This did not work at all and
   the permission was always required. It now works as described.

Before 3.4

This package was part of the Zope 3 distribution and did not have its own
