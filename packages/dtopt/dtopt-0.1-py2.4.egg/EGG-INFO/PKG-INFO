Description: 
        
        When using the `doctest
        
        <http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-doctest.html>`_ module it is
        
        often convenient to use the ELLIPSIS option, which allows you to use
        
        ``...`` as a wildcard.  But you either have to setup the test runner
        
        to use this option, or you must put ``#doctest: +ELLIPSIS`` on *every*
        
        example that uses this feature.
        
        
        
        ``dtopt`` lets you enable this option globally from within a doctest,
        
        by doing::
        
        
        
        >>> from dtopt import ELLIPSIS
        
        
        
        (The options ``NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE`` and ``COMPARE`` are also
        
        available)
        
        
        
        You can install this from `the subversion repository
        
        <http://svn.colorstudy.com/dtopt/trunk/#egg=dtopt-dev>`_ with
        
        ``easy_install dtopt==dev``.
