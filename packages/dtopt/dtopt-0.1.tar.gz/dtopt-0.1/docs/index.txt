dtopt
=====

When using the `doctest
<http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-doctest.html>`_ module it is
often convenient to use the ELLIPSIS option, which allows you to use
``...`` as a wildcard.  But you either have to setup the test runner
to use this option, or you must put ``#doctest: +ELLIPSIS`` on *every*
example that uses this feature.

``dtopt`` lets you enable this option globally from within a doctest,
by doing::

    >>> from dtopt import ELLIPSIS

(The options ``NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE`` and ``COMPARE`` are also
available)

You can install this from `the subversion repository
<http://svn.colorstudy.com/dtopt/trunk/#egg=dtopt-dev>`_ with
``easy_install dtopt==dev``.
