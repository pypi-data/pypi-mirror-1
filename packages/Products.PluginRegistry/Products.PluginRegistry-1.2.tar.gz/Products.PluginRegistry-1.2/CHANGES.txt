  along with a ZMI form for updating it as XML.

- Added support for exporting / importing registry via GenericSetup.

- Moved from CVS to subversion (2005-10-14).

- Removed deprecation warings under Zope 2.8.x.

- Repaired warings appearing in Zope 2.8.5 due to a couple typos
  in security declarations.


1.0.2 (2005-01-31)
------------------

- Simplified package directory computation using 'package_home'.

- Added 'test_suite' to registry tests to improve testability under
  'zopectl test'.
