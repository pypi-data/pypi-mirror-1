==================

 - Rename the buildout ``download-directory`` option to ``download-cache``

 - Added the `download-only` option to allow downloading arbitrary
   files. [dokai]

 - Recipe is now a new-style Python class so recipe subclasses can use super()
   method to get some default behavior. [hexsprite]

1.0.1 (2007-08-14)
==================

 - For consistency with other similar recipes, the recipe now sets a
   ``location`` option which may be read by other sections to learn

   ``destination`` option.
