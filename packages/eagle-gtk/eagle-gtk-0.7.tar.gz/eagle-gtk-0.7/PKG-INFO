Description: Eagle is an abstraction layer atop Graphical Toolkits focused on
        making simple applications easy to build while powerful in features.
        
        With Eagle you have many facilities to build application that needs
        just some buttons, user input and a canvas to draw.
        
        Canvas is really simple, what makes Eagle a great solution to
        Computer Graphics and Image Processing software, the primary focus
        of this library.
        
        User input widgets are persistent, you just need to mark them
        "persistent" or put them in the preferences area.
        
        Eagle is not meant to be another Graphical Toolkit, you already
        have a bunch of them, like Qt, Gtk, wxWidgets (to name just a few).
        It's focused on applications that have few windows, with buttons,
        simple user input and canvas. Widgets are laid out automatically
        in 5 areas: left, right, top, bottom and center.
        
        It provides useful widgets like: Color selector, Font selector,
        Quit button, Preferences button and bialog, About dialog and Help
        dialog.
