"""babtools_EXAMPLE - Example structure with efficient PyPI usage for  babtools.

This example covers a nice setup.py file, which gets name and description for the PyPI from the docstrings in itself as well as in the main file (babtools_EXAMPLE.py). 

The changelog is automatically extracted from the file Changelog.txt and appended to the long description for the PyPI. 

Info and API: http://rakjar.de/babtools_gentoo/apidocs/ """
