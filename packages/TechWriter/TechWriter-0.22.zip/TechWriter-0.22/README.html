<h1><a id="introduction" name="introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p><a href="http://www.iconsupport.demon.co.uk/">TechWriter</a> is a mathematical word processor for the RISC OS platform that
encourages authors to write documents in a structured style. Unlike other
word processors, in which chapters and sections are created by inserting
styled text in the appropriate places to create headings, TechWriter documents
are collections of nested objects, representing chapters, sections, figures
and other elements.</p>
<p>Although this structured, object-based approach is ideal for certain kinds of
documents and resembles other document creation systems, it is not easy to
convert documents stored in TechWriter's file format to file formats for use
with systems such as <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> and <a href="http://www.lyx.org/">LyX</a>. TechWriter can export documents as <a href="http://www.tug.org/">TeX</a>
files, but this process doesn't export all the information that some users
require, it can produce TeX markup that isn't suitable for re-use, and it
requires that the document's author is able to use TechWriter to perform the
conversion.</p>
<p>This package aims to help those who want to convert documents written using
TechWriter to other formats, extracting their contents reliably and as
accurately as possible, by providing a package and some tools for use with the
<a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> programming language.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h1><a id="the-techwriter-package" name="the-techwriter-package">The TechWriter Package</a></h1>
<p>A Python package is provided that provides facilities for reading TechWriter
format files (filetype D01 on RISC OS) and extracting information about its
structure and contents.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <tt><span>document</span></tt> module contains the <tt><span>Document</span></tt> class that is used to
read TechWriter files and store information about their contents.</li>
<li>The <tt><span>maths</span></tt> and <tt><span>text</span></tt> modules contain classes that encapsulate
information about mathematical notation and textual effects.</li>
<li>The <tt><span>objects</span></tt> module contains classes to represent document structures.</li>
<li>The <tt><span>Writers</span></tt> package provides simple implementations of writers for HTML,
LaTeX and OpenDocument Text formats, as well as a writer that creates a
summary in HTML of the contents of a document.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h1><a id="requirements" name="requirements">Requirements</a></h1>
<p>The OpenDocument Text writer depends on the <a href="http://opendocumentfellowship.com/projects/odfpy">odfpy</a> package. This can be
installed separately using the instructions given in the documentation for
that package.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h1><a id="installation" name="installation">Installation</a></h1>
<p>To install the package alongside other packages and modules in your Python
installation, unpack the contents of the archive. At the command line, enter
the directory containing the <tt><span>setup.py</span></tt> script and install it by typing the
following:</p>
<pre>
python setup.py install
</pre>
<p>You may need to become the root user or administrator to do this.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h1><a id="tools" name="tools">Tools</a></h1>
<p>Currently, the following convertor tools are provided in the <tt><span>Tools</span></tt>
directory. These read TechWriter files and write out one or more files in
the appropriate formats. Tools that use the <tt><span>TechWriter</span></tt> package are
expected to be minimal wrappers around the features of the writer modules
they use.</p>
<ul>
<li><tt><span>tw2latex.py</span></tt> writes files containing LaTeX markup.</li>
<li><tt><span>tw2html.py</span></tt> writes HTML files.</li>
<li><tt><span>tw2odt.py</span></tt> writes files in OpenDocument Text format, suitable for
reading in OpenOffice.org.</li>
</ul>
