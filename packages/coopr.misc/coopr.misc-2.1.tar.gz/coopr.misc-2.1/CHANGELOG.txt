======================
 coopr.misc CHANGELOG
======================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 2.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Updated pyro_mip_server to accept warm-start files and transfer them to the
  solver plugins.

- Grab the mipgap solver option from the pickled configuration data.

- Updating PyPI categories.

- Bug fix: If Python version is < 2.6.4, then checkout Coopr Forum with
  http. Otherwise, use https.

  There's a deeper issue here. A bug fix in 2.6.3 allowed https URLs to
  be opened through a proxy. This is exactly what we need at Sandia, so
  unless we have Python 2.6.4 installed everywhere, it doesn't make sense to
  use https for Coopr Forum.

  NOTE: other users may run into this problem when using
  coopr_install. I'll wait for that to happen, but when/if it does,
  we'll probably need to rework the coopr_install configuration to use
  pypi rather than https URLs for release branches.

- Rework of coopr_install logic. The coopr.py script was revised to create
  a CooprInstaller class. The main reason for this is the fact that the
  '.forum' options have been removed from pyutilib.virtualenv; logically,
  they should be directly supported in Coopr.

  I've also added support for the GOOGLECODE_USERNAME environment
  variable, which will be used to check out Coopr Forum code. However,
  this doesn't work as I expect: if you checkout with the .username
  option, then subversion doesn't know about this information when you
  go to commit. Thus, you still need to specify the .username option
  when you commit!

- Update coopr_install to use the following external config file:

    https://software.sandia.gov/svn/public/coopr/vpy/installer.ini

  This change will allow Coopr developers to reconfigure installer
  behavior without regenerating the installer!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 2.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Initial release of Coopr to create the coopr.misc package.

- See coopr.dist for previous ChangeLog information related to Coopr.
