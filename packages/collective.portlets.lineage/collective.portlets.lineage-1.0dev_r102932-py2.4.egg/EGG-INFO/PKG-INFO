Description: Introduction
        ============
        Portlets which can optionally include or exclude content from subsites, as provided by collective.lineage ChildFolder.
        
        The portlets filter out subsite paths via the use of Products.AdvancedQuery, which ships with Plone 3.x
        
        These portlets require that collective.lineage be installed in your Plone site.
