Description: 
        This package provides a number of scripts that are used to perform a variety of
        tasks that all involve getting user verification and feedback using the xxdiff
        graphical differences viewer.
        
        For example, there are scripts to perform global renaming of strings within a
        large codebase, where each transformed file is viewed by the user with an
        xxdiff, accepted, rejected or merged changes written over the original file
        (file backups are supported).  Also, this infrastructure is mostly provided as
        modules, in order to allow users to write file transformations in Python and to
        leverage this interactive confirmation process.
        
        There are also scripts that visualize diffs for a number of SCM systems, like
        CVS, Subversion, etc.  This package was born after a number of these useful
        scripts had sprouted, and it became apparent that sharing the common code for
        the scripts would be a great advantage to tools writers.
