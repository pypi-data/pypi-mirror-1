0.8 (2009-05-25)
================

Features
--------

Fix a bug in FileStorageURIResolver whereby fully-qualified paths to
Windows files (e.g. ``file://C:\foo\bar\baz?a=1``) were parsed
incorrectly, resulting in a bogus file location.

0.7 (2009-04-23)
================

Features
--------

Added support for multi-databases in PersistentApplicationFinder.
Just pass multiple URIs to the constructor, either as a list of
strings or a single string with URIs separated by whitespace. Each
database must have a distinct database_name. The first URI specifies
the root database.

0.6 (2008-01-06)
================

Backwards Incompatibilities
----------------------------

``dbfactory_from_uri`` now returns only a single argument (the
factory).

Features
--------

Docs updated with argument values for ``file://`` and ``zeo://`` URI
schemes; this file converted to real REST.

0.5 (unknown)
=============

Pass ``layout`` to BlobStorage as a kwarg explicitly (for forward
compatibility).

Depend on ZODB3 3.8.1+.

0.4 (unknown)
=============

Add ``connection_cache_size``, ``connection_pool_size``, and
``database_name`` arguments to both FileStorage and ClientStorage URI
resolver schemes.  ``connection_cache_size`` represents the ZODB
object cache size (the ``cache_size`` parameter to the DB
constructor), ``connection_pool_size`` represents the ZODB connection
pool size (the ``pool_size`` parameter to the DB constructor), and
``database_name`` represents the ZODB database name (the
``database_name`` parameter to the DB constructor).
``connection_cache_size`` defaults to 10000 (overriding the too-low DB
constructor default of 400), ``connection_pool_size`` defaults to 7,
and ``database_name`` defaults to ``unnamed``.

0.3 (unknown)
=============

Add 'egg:repoze.zodbconn#closer' middleware.

Add blobstorage and demostorage support to zeo and file resolvers.

0.2 (unknown)
=============

Unknown changes

0.1 (unknown)
=============

Initial release.
