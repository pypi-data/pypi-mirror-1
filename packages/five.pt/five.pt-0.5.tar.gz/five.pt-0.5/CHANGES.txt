Changelog
=========

five.pt 0.5 (released 2/17/2009)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added test function to template context. [malthe]

- Fixed edge-case (special case?) where the view of a
  ViewPageTemplateFile is really only the view for a view. [malthe]

- Added patch for ``Products.PageTemplates.PageTemplateFile``. [malthe]

- Rework the "full namespace provided to path expression" change introduced
  in 0.3. We no longer call the expensive locals() function but construct a
  minimal namespace with the context and request ourselves. [hannosch]

- If the ``__get__`` method is called uninstantiated, just return the
  class itself. [malthe]

five.pt 0.4 (released 2/13/2009)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed issue where the ``template`` parameter to a viewlet manager
  directive was effectively ignored. [malthe]

- Fixed acquisition-wrapping issue with the (patched) bound template
  class (could cause infinite loop due to cyclic acquisition
  chain). [malthe]

- Moved evaluate_path and evaluate_exists over to ``z3c.pt``, adding
  support for global ``path()`` and ``exists()`` functions for use in
  ``python:`` expressions to it (LP #317967). [sidnei]

five.pt 0.3 (released 12/17/2008)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Use bobo traversal if ``OFS.interfaces.ITraversable`` interface is
  provided. [malthe]

- Adjusted the path expression to provide the full namespace to the render
  function and not just the request. This matches Zope2 behavior. [hannosch]

five.pt 0.2 (released 11/29/2008)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- From Zope 2.12 onwards, do not acquisition-wrap content
  provider. [malthe]
