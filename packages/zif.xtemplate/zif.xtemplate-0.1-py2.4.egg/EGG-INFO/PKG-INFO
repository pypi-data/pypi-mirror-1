        =============
        zif.xtemplate
        =============
        
        zif.xtemplate provides a base class for browser views.  It descends from
        zope.publisher.browser.BrowserPage to provide the base information you need
        to create a data-centric page, namely context and request.  zif.XTemplate
        leverages lxml's elementtree interface, fast serializing of XML, and XPath
        support to generate HTML in a fast, safe, and pythonic fashion.
        
        It is fairly simple to create a basic page.  Just make a view class that is a
        descendent of zif.xtemplate.xtemplate.XTemplate.
        
        ::
        
        >>> from zif.xtemplate import XTemplate
        >>> class TestViewClass(XTemplate):
        ...     pass
        
        The base class does not put out a particularly interesting page, but the output
        is a well-formed, perfectly functional, if empty, page of HTML.  Let's register
        the page in zcml and see what it looks like.
        
        ::
        
        >>> from zope.configuration import xmlconfig
        >>> ignored = xmlconfig.string("""
        ... <configure
        ...   xmlns="http://namespaces.zope.org/zope"
        ...   xmlns:browser="http://namespaces.zope.org/browser"
        ...   >
        ...  <!-- allow browser directives here -->
        ...  <include package="zope.app.publisher.browser" file="meta.zcml" />
        ...  <browser:page
        ...     name="testview.html"
        ...     for="*"
        ...     class="zif.xtemplate.README.TestViewClass"
        ...     permission="zope.Public"
        ...     />
        ... </configure>
        ... """)
        
        Start a browser.
        
        ::
        
        >>> from zope.testbrowser.testing import Browser
        >>> browser = Browser('http://localhost/')
        >>> #browser.handleErrors = False
        >>> browser.open('/testview.html')
        
        The page has a DOCTYPE string:
        
        ::
        
        >>> 'DOCTYPE' in browser.contents
        True
        
        The page has a &lt;head> element.
        
        ::
        
        >>> '<head>' in browser.contents
        True
        
        The page has a &lt;body> element.
        
        ::
        
        >>> '<body>' in browser.contents
        True
        >>> browser.contents=='''<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
        ... "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
        ... <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" lang="en">
        ...   <head>
        ...     <title>Untitled</title>
        ...     <meta content="text/html;charset=utf-8" http-equiv="content-type" />
        ...     <meta content="zif.xtemplate" name="generator" />
        ...     <meta content="text/css" http-equiv="Content-Style-Type" />
        ...   </head>
        ...   <body></body>
        ... </html>'''
        True
        
        Let's do a view class that is a bit more interesting.  We will start from the
        base class and add some paragraphs to the body. The elementtree API is flexible;
        p0, p1, and p2 are similar paragraphs, but constructed in different ways.
        Notice that we do not have to close the tags. Elementtree takes care of that for
        us. We always use lxml.etree. (c)elementtree is not compatible here, because
        xpath is necessary to process the document before it is serialized.  Some of
        that processing assures proper output of empty elements that should not be
        XMLminimized.  For example, &lt;div class="blah" /> is not valid HTML, and an
        empty div needs be output as, for this example, &lt;div class="blah">&lt;/div>.
        
        This class obtains context and request, which are the same context and request
        you are familiar with.  The render() method is the only one actually needed in
        a subclass.  Additional methods may be used to refactor repetitive operations.
        They are also recommended just to make the code more readable.  Blank lines also
        help.  A render() method can turn into a huge block of grey fairly easily.
        
        ::
        
        >>> from lxml.etree import Element, SubElement, Comment
        >>> class TestViewClass2(XTemplate):
        ...    title="Test2"
        ...
        ...    def getHelloWorld(self):
        ...        return "Hello, World!"
        ...
        ...    def putInSnippet(self):
        ...        snippet = '<p id="newp1">This is <em>fun</em>.</p>'
        ...        self.appendSnippet(self.body,snippet,sanitize=False)
        ...
        ...    def render(self):
        ...        context = self.context
        ...        request = self.request
        ...
        ...        self.addStyleSheet('/@@/resource1/mystylesheet.css')
        ...        hwtext = self.getHelloWorld()
        ...
        ...        p0 = SubElement(self.body,'p',{'style':'color:red;','id':'p0'})
        ...        p0.text = hwtext
        ...
        ...        p1 = Element('p')
        ...        p1.set('style','color:blue;')
        ...        p1.text = hwtext
        ...        self.body.append(p1)
        ...
        ...        p2 = SubElement(self.body,'p',style="color:green;")
        ...        p2.text = hwtext
        ...
        ...        # a <span> element goes after p0's text.  We still have a pointer
        ...        # to p0, so it does not matter that this is out-of-order.
        ...        span0 = SubElement(p0,'span')
        ...        # text inside the span
        ...        span0.text = ' And Hello to '
        ...        # text that follows the span, still in the same paragraph
        ...        span0.tail = 'other worlds, too!'
        ...
        ...        self.putInSnippet()
        ...        self.body.append(Comment("The <p> above is a parsed snippet."))
        ...
        ...        self.getElementById('newp1').set('class','paragraph1')
        
        So, we register this view:
        
        ::
        
        >>> ignored = xmlconfig.string("""
        ... <configure
        ...   xmlns="http://namespaces.zope.org/zope"
        ...   xmlns:browser="http://namespaces.zope.org/browser"
        ...   >
        ...  <!-- allow browser directives here -->
        ...  <include package="zope.app.publisher.browser" file="meta.zcml" />
        ...  <browser:page
        ...     name="testview2.html"
        ...     for="*"
        ...     class="zif.xtemplate.README.TestViewClass2"
        ...     permission="zope.Public"
        ...     />
        ... </configure>
        ... """)
        
        And let's look at the output a bit.
        
        ::
        
        >>> browser = Browser('http://localhost/')
        >>> #browser.handleErrors = False

        >>> browser.contents.count('Hello, World!') == 3
        True
        >>> browser.contents.count('<em>fun</em>') == 1
        True
        >>> browser.contents =='''<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"

        True
        
        It's not easy to see what's going on here, so we will operate the class directly
        to show how it works.
        
        Since XTemplate descends from BrowserView, it needs to be instanciated with
        context and request.
        
        ::
        
        >>> class TestResponse(object):
        ...     def setHeader(self,key,value):
        ...         pass
        >>> class TestRequest(dict):
        ...     def __init__(self):
        ...         self.environment = {}
        ...         self.response = TestResponse()
        >>> context = None
        >>> request = TestRequest()
        >>> myDoc = TestViewClass2(context,request)
        
        The base lxml element is myDoc.document.  The instance variables, myDoc.body and
        myDoc.head correspond to the &lt;body> and &lt;head> elements of myDoc.document.
        Adding to and manipulating the document are ordinarily done using lxml's
        elementtree API, using self.body and self.head as the initial hooks into the
        document.  Most of what you need to know to use xtemplates is knowing a bit
        about lxml.
        
        ::
        
        >>> type(myDoc.document)
        <type 'etree._ElementTree'>
        >>> type(myDoc.body)
        <type 'etree._Element'>
        >>> type(myDoc.head)
        <type 'etree._Element'>
        
        Default body is empty at instanciation.
        
        ::
        
        >>> [item for item in myDoc.body]
        []
        
        Nothing happens with the document until it is called.  XTemplate's __call__
        method calls render(), then calls finalizePage(), which in turn calls a few
        methods that post-process the document. XTemplate uses lxml's xpath
        functionality internally, so (c)elementtree will not work here.  Ultimately, the
        ElementTree in the .document instance variable is serialized to unicode and
        returned to Zope for output.
        
        ::
        
        >>> myDoc.render()
        >>> [item.text for item in myDoc.body.xpath('p')]
        ['Hello, World!', 'Hello, World!', 'Hello, World!', 'This is ']
        
        A note about the xpath expression in the code above.  All lxml Elements have
        xpath functionality.  Above, we asked for the list of all "p" elements in
        myDoc.body.  xpath expressions can be used to obtain lists of Elements of a
        particular description.  To find the list of empty elements for postprocessing,
        xtemplate uses the xpath expression "//*[count(*)=0]". You may tailor an xpath
        expression to find practically any subset of elements in a document.  For
        example, if you need to access an Element with an id of "bob", the xpath
        expression would be "//*[@id='bob']". XTemplate uses this internally in its
        getElementById method.  This only scratches the surface of what is possible with
        xpath expressions.  You do not need to be an xpath expert to use xpath
        expressions.  I am certainly not one.  To find the above, I Googled.
        
        Just a bit about text and tail.  It takes a bit of getting used to the "text"
        and "tail" instance variables in an elementtree Element.  Particularly when an
        Element allows mixed content (text and tags interspersed), it can be difficult
        to determine exactly which tag gets what text.  As a hopefully clear
        illustration, consider the following.  How would you create this with lxml?
        
        ::
        
        <c><a>text_a<b>text_b</b>tail_b</a>tail_a</c>
        
        Here's some code that creates the above.  An element's "text" comes after the
        element's start tag and before the next tag.  An element's "tail" comes after
        the element's closing tag and before the next tag.
        
        ::
        
        >>> from lxml.etree import Element, SubElement, tostring
        >>> c = Element('c')
        >>> a = SubElement(c,'a')
        >>> a.text = 'text_a'
        >>> a.tail = 'tail_a'
        >>> b = SubElement(a,'b')
        >>> b.text = 'text_b'
        >>> b.tail = 'tail_b'
        >>> tostring(c)
        '<c><a>text_a<b>text_b</b>tail_b</a>tail_a</c>'
        
        It would be a chore to make users do this, and we probably do not want users
        directly accessing the lxml code.  Fortunately, xtemplate has a helper method,
        appendSnippet, that takes care of the fuss.  Let's say we want to append a
        snippet to myDoc.  Let's pretend the user-generated string comes from a form.
        
        ::
        
        >>> snippet = '<p>This is <em>user-generated</em> HTML </p>'
        
        The wrong way to do this is to make a &lt;div> and make the snippet its text.
        
        ::
        
        >>> div = SubElement(myDoc.body,'div')
        >>> div.text = snippet
        >>> tostring(div)
        '<div>&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;user-generated&lt;/em&gt; HTML &lt;/p&gt;</div>'
        
        Ick!  The tags were HTML-escaped!  This is better...
        
        ::
        
        >>> #first clear out the bad text
        >>> div.text = None
        >>> myDoc.appendSnippet(div,snippet)
        >>> tostring(div)
        '<div><p>This is <em>user-generated</em> HTML </p></div>'
        
        One important thing that zif.xtemplate does for you is assuring that the HTML
        is valid.  It does not bother parsing the document for complete DTD compliance,
        but it does some work to assure that for the most part, your HTML is
        syntactically correct.
        
        ::
        
        >>> newDoc = TestViewClass(context,request)
        >>> mainDiv = Element('div', {'id':'main'})
        >>> newDoc.body.append(mainDiv)
        >>> tostring(newDoc.document)
        '<html><head/><body><div id="main"/></body></html>'
        
        We know that &lt;div id="main"/> is not valid html, because a div tag must have
        a closing div tag.  The XML-miminized &lt;head> is also a problem.  One of the
        methods that is called in finalizePage() is fixEmptyElements.  After this is
        called, the document is more like HTML than XML.
        
        ::
        
        >>> newDoc.fixEmptyElements()
        >>> tostring(newDoc.document)
        '<html><head></head><body><div id="main"></div></body></html>'
        
        zif.xtemplate won't mess with elements that are allowed to be minimized.  Note that the
        &lt;input> tag is left alone below.
        
        ::
        
        >>> form = SubElement(mainDiv,'form')
        >>> input = SubElement(form,'input',{'type':'submit','value':'OK'})
        >>> newDoc.fixEmptyElements()
        >>> tostring(newDoc.document)
        '<ht...<form><input type="submit" value="OK"/></form></div></body></html>'
        
        zif.xtemplate will fill out "action" and "method" in &lt;form> elements if you
        leave them out.  Let's call a document and see how the postprocessing alters it.
        Note that empty, xml-minimized tags have an XHTML 1.0 appendix c correction: an
        extra space before the slash ending the tag.
        
        ::
        
        >>> #First, we trick TestRequest into having PATH_INFO
        >>> request['PATH_INFO'] = 'http://localhost/index.html'
        >>> newDoc = TestViewClass(context,request)
        >>> #charset is ordinarily gotten from request, but we have to set it here
        >>> newDoc.charset = 'utf-8'
        >>> mainDiv = Element('div', {'id':'main'})
        >>> newDoc.body.append(mainDiv)
        >>> form = SubElement(mainDiv,'form')
        >>> input = SubElement(form,'input',{'type':'submit','value':'OK'})
        >>> newDoc()
        '<!DOC...<form action="http://localhost/index.html" method="post">...<input type="submit" value="OK" />...'
        
        Templating, making several pages have the same look, is easy if you create one
        class that does the common boilerplate, then create subclasses of that class.
        You will want to super() the render method.  Note that self.body, self.head,
        and self.docElement are available to all subclasses, as well as a DOM-ish
        method, getElementById(). If your template classes or base templates have
        elements with "id" attributes, you can access those elements with the
        getElementById method.  lxml's element.xpath("XPathExpr") and XSLT facilities
        are also available to use for page generation.
        
        The appendSnippet method has sanitize=True by default, which means that only
        tags and elements in a white list are included in the output.  This should
        reduce the chance of cross-site scripting exploits, and is the recommended way
        to output user-provided text if HTML is allowed.  Simply setting the text or
        tail properties of an element will always HTML-escape the text.  See
        "HTMLSanitizer":/sanitizer_README.html for more info about how it works.
        
        Inline javascript is likely to be troublesome; it is difficult to get "&lt;" and
        "&amp;" in text.  The work-around is to use external files for javascript.  It is a
        good idea anyway.  Use the addScript(url) method.
        
        There are some class variables / switches that affect output and processing.
        For reference, they are provided here.  Override in subclasses as needed.
        
        - **defaultTitle** - a default title.  This is the ultimate fallback when no title can
        be found. Default: u'Untitled'
        
        - **lang** - page language.  Overridable in subclasses. Default: u'en'
        
        - **strictXHTML** - try to do XHTML strict where supported by browser. Default: True
        
        - **useMetaContentTypeTag** - include a meta tag with content-type and charset.
        Default: True
        
        - **cacheControl** - invoke the (overridable) doCacheControl method. Default: True
        
        - **title** - the title.  Just one of many ways to set title. Default: u''
        
        - **docTypeHeader** - do a &lt;!DOCTYPE... statement at the beginning.  Default: True
        
        - **prettyPrint** - indent where feasible. Default: True
        
        - **tdFix** - do not indent content inside td tags when pretty printing.
        Default: False
        
        - **benchmark** - put a note about page generation time into log. Default: True
        
        - **generatorTag** - a bit of advertising, but can be overridden.  Default: True
        
        - **template** - a string or unicode of well-formed HTML we wish to start with
        as a template. Namespace declarations and METAL/TAL are not currently
        supported. Default: the contents of the basetemplate.html file in the
        distribution folder. You may override the default behavior by overriding the
        getTemplate method.
        
        If your class provides a postProcess() method, this will be called just before
        the output is serialized. A postProcess() method provides a final opportunity to
        apply global changes to the document.  For ultimate control, override the
        __call__ method, and return a unicode string.
