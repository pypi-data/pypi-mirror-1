Description: Fake Zope 2 Eggs
        ================
        
        Zope 2 isn't eggified yet, Zope 3 does. That can become a problem if you want to
        install some egg with depedencies related to Zope 3 eggs (such as zope.interface,
        zope.component, ...)
        
        This buildout recipe will simply add some fake egg link to zope libraries (installed
        inside zope/lib/python/zope/...) so that setuptools can see that the dependencies are
        already satisfied and it won't fetch them anymore.
        
        Just add it to your buildout config like this:
        
        [buildout]
        
        parts =
        ... your other parts ...
        fakezope2eggs
        
        [fakezope2eggs]
        recipe = affinitic.recipe.fakezope2eggs
        
        Be careful to run this recipe after the plone.recipe.zope2install recipe.
