""" Command-line tool for writing optical media.

    'burn' is a command-line tool to create audio discs from MP3, Ogg
    Vorbis, or WAV files, to backup data files, to create discs from
    ISO-9660 images, and to copy discs on-the-fly. It performs any of
    its functions in a single command, without requiring preparatory
    filesystem creation, etc.

    The program can compute if there is necessary free space for
    temporary files (images and audio files), warn if size is bigger
    than disc capacity, and manage multisession discs.
