This is not a bug: even if the given audio files order is different,
        wav files will be processed and burned before ogg files which
        will be processed and burned before mp3 files. So no order
        will be kept.

Internal decoding (mp3 to wav) in powerpc does not work and ends
up in noisy audio files.
If you have powerpc use external_decoding=yes in burn.conf
