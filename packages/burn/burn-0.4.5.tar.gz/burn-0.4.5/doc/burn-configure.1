.SH SYNOPSIS
burn\-configure


.SH DESCRIPTION
burn\-configure is a configuration utility for \fBburn(1)\fP. Burn (“Burn
until recorded, now!”) is a tool for writing optical media of various
kinds.

The \fBburn(1)\fP program looks for its configuration settings in the
following files: \fB/etc/burn.conf\fP, \fB~/.burnrc\fP.

When invoked, burn\-configure will ask a series of questions interactively
at the console, and then write a new configuration to the file
\fBburn.conf.new\fP in the current directory. This file can then be used
for the contents of any of the \fBburn(1)\fP configuration files.
