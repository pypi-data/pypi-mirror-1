SYNOPSIS
========

|command|

DESCRIPTION
===========

|command| is a configuration utility for ``burn(1)``. Burn (“Burn
until recorded, now!”) is a tool for writing optical media of various
kinds.

The ``burn(1)`` program looks for its configuration settings in the
following files: ``/etc/burn.conf``, ``~/.burnrc``.

When invoked, |command| will ask a series of questions interactively
at the console, and then write a new configuration to the file
``burn.conf.new`` in the current directory. This file can then be used
for the contents of any of the ``burn(1)`` configuration files.
