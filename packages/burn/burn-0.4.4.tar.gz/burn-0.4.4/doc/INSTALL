burn: Burn Until Ready, Now!
############################

Installation
############

In order to use burn properly, please follow the following steps.


Dependencies
============

Be sure you have installed properly:

* python (>= 2.5)

* cdrecord (>= 4:2.01)

* mkisofs (>= 4:2.01)

* cdrdao

* eyeD3 <http://www.travisshirk.net/eyeD3/releases>
  (generic MP3 tag modules for Python)

* pyogg (python-pyvorbis) <http://www.andrewchatham.com/pyogg/>
  (generic Ogg Vorbis modules for Python)
  
Please refer to the documentation provided with the above programs in
order to make them work.

Optionally you can choose not to decode mp3 and ogg files with native
burn functions choosing to do it with external decoders. If you want
to do so, you have to install preferred decoders (lame, ogg123,
mpg321, mpg123, etc.) and set up burn.conf.

Warning powerpc users: internal decoder (mp3 to wav) does not work.
Please use external decoding.

Package installation
====================

It is possible to unpack the source tarball and run the programs
directly from the source directory. This limits you to only running
the programs from a specific directory, though.

If you want the programs available from anywhere on the system, you
should install the package using Python's standard distutils
installation method::

    $ python ./setup.py install

This will install executable programs and Python libraries to the
default locations. Refer to the `distutils user documentation`_ for
customisation of install location and other options.

..  _distutils user documentation: http://docs.python.org/install/

Configuration file location
===========================

(You can skip this step if you want to use burn from newly
uncompressed directory. For example with point and slash in front of
it: ./burn)
          
* move configuration file (burn.conf) to your preferred location
  (e.g.: /etc/)

* edit burn executable

* find the line below the comment line:
  # CONFIGURATION FILE LOCATION *****************************

* set the absolute path for burn.conf file. 
  e.g.: config.read(['/etc/burn.conf/'])

Configure values
================

Edit configuration file (burn.conf) in order to change values to set
your preferences.

* In section [executables] please add full path to binaries.
   Here you can also enable external mp3 and ogg decoders.

* In section [ISO] you'll have to specify: temporary image directory name,
  temporary image name, Joliet support, mount point

* In section [CD-writer] you should configure your cd-writer device.
  Remember you can get LUN values for your (emulated or not) SCSI
  units with the following cdrecord command:
 
    # cdrecord -scanbus
 
   You can also choose to enable Buffer Underrun Free writing on with
   burnfree option.

* In section [CD-reader] you have to configure your CD reader unit.
  If you only have a cd-writer unit, use the same cd-writer LUN

* In section [Media] you can configure media's capacity.

Ok, that's it.
Now burn should be properly set up.
try to launch it without any options. You should get help.

Remember: you have to have *root privileges* in order to use burn.
