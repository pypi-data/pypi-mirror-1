	Version 0.4.3 released.

	* closed lots of bug.

	  cd-writing command. No check for -e and -h options.

	* fixed typo in documentation (same bug above)

	* (closes: #257437) Now -x computes excluded size. It's been hard
	  to solve it. I know there is better code for this, but it seems
	  to work.

	  Senders

	Version 0.4.2 released.

	  bar.

	  wav);

	* Audio CD now prints an audio track summary with audio
	  duration (partial an total)

	* Added --clear-audiotemp for Audio-CD. It removes temp audio
	  files at the very beginning of burn process.

	  if disk is empty.

	* added superuser(root) control. It can be overrided by ask_root
	  in burn.conf

	  variable arguments, an error is raised

	* now ti checks (and exit) if there is not enough free space on
	  disk before checking if to_be_burned is bigger than media's
	  capacity

	* added -pad option to cdrecord line (multiple of 2352 byte)

	* preparing gettext... just preparing

	* eyeD3 now is used. MP3Info is no longer used.

	* with ao python module we don't really need deoder anymore. code
	  left quoted anyway... So no more mpg321 mpg123 ogg123 lame, etc.

	* Now you can choose between native decoding functions to get wavs
	  from mp3 or ogg and external decodings (mpg123, mpg321, ogg123,
	  lame)
