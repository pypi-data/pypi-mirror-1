- Write the z3monitor tests.
- See if combined README + README_2 + README_3 makes a comprehensible document

For future versions:

- queues should be pluggable like agent with filter
- show how to broadcast, maybe add conveniences
- show how to use with collapsing jobs (hint to future self: use external queue
  to put in work, and have job(s) just pull what they can see from queue)

For some other package, maybe:

- TTW Management and logging views, as in zasync (see goals in the "History"
  section of the README).
