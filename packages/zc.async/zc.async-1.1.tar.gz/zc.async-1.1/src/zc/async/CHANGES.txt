1.1 (2008-04-24)
================

- Fired events when the IQueues and IQueue objects are installed by the
  QueueInstaller (thanks to Fred Drake).

- Dispatchers make agent threads keep their connections, so each connection's
  object cache use is optimized if the agent regularly requests jobs with
  the same objects.

- README improved (thanks to Benji York and Sebastian Ware).

- Callbacks are logged at start in the trace log.

- All job results (including callbacks) are logged, including verbose
  tracebacks if the callback generated a failure.

- Had the ThreadedDispatcherInstaller subscriber stash the thread on the
  dispatcher, so you can shut down tests like this:
  
  >>> import zc.async.dispatcher
  >>> dispatcher = zc.async.dispatcher.get()
  >>> dispatcher.reactor.callFromThread(dispatcher.reactor.stop)
  >>> dispatcher.thread.join(3)

- Added ``getQueue`` to zc.async.local as a convenience (it does what you
  could already do: ``zc.async.local.getJob().queue``).

- Clarified that ``IQueue.pull`` is the approved way of removing scheduled jobs
  from a queue in interfaces and README.

- reports in the logs of a job's success or failure come before callbacks are
  started.

- Added a section showing how the basic_dispatcher_policy.zcml worked, which
  then pushed the former README_3 examples into README_3b.

- Put ZPL everywhere I was supposed to.

- Moved a number of helpful testing functions out of footnotes and into
  zc.async.testing, both so that zc.async tests don't have to redefine them
  and client packages can reuse them.
