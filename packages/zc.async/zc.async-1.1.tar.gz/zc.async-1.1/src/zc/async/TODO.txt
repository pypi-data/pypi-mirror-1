For future versions:

- Write the z3monitor tests.
- queues should be pluggable like agent with filter
- show how to broadcast, maybe add conveniences
- show how to use with collapsing jobs (hint to future self: use external queue
  to put in work, and have job(s) just pull what they can see from queue)
- write tips and tricks
  * avoid long transactions if possible.  really avoid long transactions
    involving frequently written objects.  Discuss ramifications and
    strategies.
  * in zope.app.testing.functional tests, zc.async doesn't do well being
    started in a layer's setup because then it is associated with the
    wrapped layer DB, and the test is associated with the DemoStorage wrapper,
    so that the test can see what zc.async does, but zc.async can't see what
    the test does.  The current workaround is to start the dispatcher in the
    test or the test set up (but, again, *not* The layer set up).

For some other package, maybe:

- TTW Management and logging views, as in zasync (see goals in the "History"
  section of the README).
