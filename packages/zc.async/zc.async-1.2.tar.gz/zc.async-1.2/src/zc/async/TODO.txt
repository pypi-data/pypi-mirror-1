Improvements

- queues should be pluggable like agent with filter

More docs:

- show how to broadcast, maybe add conveniences

- show how to use with collapsing jobs (hint to future self: use external queue
  to put in work, and have job(s) just pull what they can see from queue)

- write tips and tricks

  * avoid long transactions if possible.  really avoid long transactions
    involving frequently written objects.  Discuss ramifications and
    strategies, such as doing big work in one job, then in callback schedule
    actually writing the data into the hotspot.

  * in zope.app.testing.functional tests, zc.async doesn't do well being
    started in a layer's setup because then it is associated with the
    wrapped layer DB, and the test is associated with the DemoStorage wrapper,
    so that the test can see what zc.async does, but zc.async can't see what
    the test does.  The current workaround is to start the dispatcher in the
    test or the test set up (but, again, *not* The layer set up).

  * In tests, don't check to see if poll is activated until after the first
    poll. Try ``zc.async.testing.get_poll(zc.async.dispatcher.get(), 0)``, for
    instance.

  * In tests, be aware that DemoStorage does not support mvcc and does not
    support conflict resolution, so you may experience ConflictError (write and
    particularly read) problems with it that you will not experience as much,
    or at all, with a storage that supports those features such as FileStorage.
    Notice that all of the tests in this package use FileStorage.

  * callbacks should be very, very quick, and very reliable.  If you want to do
    something that might take a while, put another job in the queue

- custom retry policies, particularly for non-transactional tasks;

- changing the default retry policy, per-process and per-agent; and

- changing the default log level for queue jobs, callback jobs, and per-job.


For some other package, maybe:

- TTW Management and logging views, as in zasync (see goals in the "History"
  section of the README).
