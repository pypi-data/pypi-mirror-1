Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package contains a unittest test class based on the one from the
        ``Mocker`` mock library (http://labix.org/mocker).
        
        This class provides support for registering Zope 3 components (utilities,
        adapters, subscription adapters and event handlers) from mocks and tearing
        down the global component registry during test tear-down.
        
        There are also a few convenience methods and parameter checkers that are
        useful to Zope and Plone testing.
        
        Please see the Mocker documentation for more detail:
        
        http://labix.org/mocker
        
        See testcase.py for more detail on the mock helper methods.
        
        A test case that mocks a utility may look like this::
        
        from plone.mocktestcase import MockTestCase
        
        from my.package.interfaces import IMyInterface
        from my.package.foo import testable_method
        
        class MyTestCase(MockTestCase):
        
        def test_something(self):
        
        utility_mock = self.mocker.mock()
        self.expect(utility_mock.do_something()).result("foo")
        self.mock_utility(utility_mock, IMyInterface)
        
        # Put mocker into replay mode
        self.replay()
        
        # Verify that testable_method() looks up a utility for
        # IMyInterface and calls do_something() on it, which returns
        # "foo".
        
        testable_method()
