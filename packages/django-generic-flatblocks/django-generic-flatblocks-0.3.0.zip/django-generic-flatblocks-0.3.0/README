django-generic-flatblocks
=========================

If you want to add tiny snippets of text to your site, manageable by the admin
backend, you would use either `django-chunks`_ or `django-flatblocks`_.
However, both of them have one problem: you are limited to a predefined
content field; a "text" field in chunks and a "title" and "text" field in
flatblocks.

django-generic-flatblocks solves this problem as it knows nothing about the 
content itself. You *attach* your hand made content node (a simple model) where
you can define any fields you want.

Documentation
=============

Documenation is `available online`_ but also shipped with this package.
See the ``docs/index.rst`` and further files for details.

To quickly generate a good looking HTML documentation, step into the ``docs/``
directory and generate the HTML docs using::

    make html

Then open the file ``_build/html/index.html``. You need the Sphinx_ package
for this.
