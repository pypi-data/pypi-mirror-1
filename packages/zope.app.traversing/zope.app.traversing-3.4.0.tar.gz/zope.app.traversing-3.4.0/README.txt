The zope.traversing package provides adapteres for resolving object paths by
traversing an object hierarchy. This also includes support for traversal
namespaces (e.g. `++view++`, `++skin++`, etc.) as well as computing URLs via the
`@@absolute_url` view.

DEPRECATED: This package has been deprecated and its functionality moved to
``zope.traversing``.
