Jug: A Task-Based Parallelization Framework
-------------------------------------------

Jug allows you to write code that is broken up into
tasks and run different tasks on different processors.

It uses the filesystem to communicate between processes and
works correctly over NFS, so you can coordinate processes on
different machines.


Jug is a pure Python implementation and should work on any platform.
