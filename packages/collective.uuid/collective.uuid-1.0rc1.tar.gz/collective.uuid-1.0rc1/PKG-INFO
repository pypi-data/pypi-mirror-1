Description: This is a library for providing RFC 4122 uuid utilities in Zope 2 and Zope 3.
        It is modeled on zope.app.intid functionally, though much of the generic bits
        are factored out into collective.baseid. Requires five.intid to run on Zope 2
        - this will not be installed by default, as it is a platform-specific
        dependency.
