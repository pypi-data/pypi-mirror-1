1. Coordinating events 
</H1>

<P>
There are several ways to organize the sequence of your experiments
using the Vision Egg.  You can write your own custom flow control and
event handling, using the Vision Egg solely for drawing graphics.
This is often useful in psychophysics experiments where interaction
with a subject is interleaved with presentation of stimuli.

<P>
Alternatively, you can make use of the classes in
<tt class="module">VisionEgg.FlowControl</tt>.  For example, <tt class="class">Presentation</tt> is a class
that maintains an association between the parameters of stimuli and
their control functions, calls these functions, and initiates drawing
of the stimuli.  There are several ways to use the
<tt class="class">Presentation</tt> class described below.  This mode of operation is
useful for electrophysiology experiments.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION003100000000000000000">
1.1 Custom flow control and event handling</A>
</H1>

<P>
By writing your own custom flow control code, you have much more
flexibility in designing experiments, but also less of the work
involved has been done for you.  Perhaps the best place to start is
simply to look at some examples.  See the demonstration scripts
dots_simple_loop.py, mouseTarget_user_loop.py, and multi_stim.py.
Each of these programs has its own main loop which performs the same
role as the <tt class="class">Presentation</tt> class's <tt class="method">go</tt> and
<tt class="method">run_forever</tt> methods, which are described further in this chapter.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION003200000000000000000">
1.2 Using the Presentation class: Running a single trial</A>
</H1>

<P>
Most of the Vision Egg demonstration scripts run a single trial and
then quit. From a programming perspective, this is the easiest way to
get started. The timing and control of events within a single trial is
performed by a ``go loop'', which is entered by calling the
<tt class="method">go()</tt> method of the <tt class="class">Presentation</tt> class.

<P>
A cycle of the go loop consists of updating any relevant stimulus
parameters, clearing the framebuffer, and calling the stimuli to draw
themselves.  The buffers are swapped and the cycle begins again,
usually after waiting for the vertical blanking interval (see the
section in this manual on double buffering).  When waiting for the
vertical blanking interval (``sync swap buffers'') is enabled, cycles
through the ``go loop'' never occur faster than the frame rate.  If
the go loop is burdened with lots of calculations or if the operating
system takes the CPU away from the Vision Egg, the cycle through the
go loop is not completed before the video card begins drawing the next
frame and therefore a frame is skipped.

<P>
A go loop can run indefinitly or have its duration limited to a
duration measured in seconds or in number of frames drawn.  (Measuring
duration based on frames drawn is only meaningful when buffer swapping
is synchronized with the vertical blanking interval and frame skipping
would be particularly undesirable in this case.)

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION003300000000000000000">
1.3 Using the Presentation class: Continuous operation</A>
</H1>

<P>
Often, the visual stimulus needs to continue running between trials.
At a minimum this could be used to keep the display constant and to
prevent the Vision Egg from quitting, but could also be used to
maintain a moving pattern on the display between trials.  In addition,
it may be necessary to trigger a go loop with a minimum of latency
after the receipt of some signal, such as a digital input on the
parallel port.

<P>
To use the Vision Egg in this manner, the <tt class="method">run_forever()</tt>
method of <tt class="class">Presentation</tt> is called, which begins a loop that
performs the same tasks as a go loop with the exception that functions
controlling stimulus parameters are informed that it is a ``between go
loops'' state.  At any point this <tt class="method">run_forever</tt> loop can create
a go loop, which returns control back to the <tt class="method">run_forever</tt> loop
when done.  Alternatively, if the controlling functions for stimulus
parameters operate between go loops, the entire experiment could be
run without entering a go loop.  (This could also be acheived by
starting a go loop with a duration parameter set to ``forever''.)
