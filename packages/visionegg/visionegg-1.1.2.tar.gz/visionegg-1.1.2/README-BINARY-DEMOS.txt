WELCOME

Thanks for checking out the Vision Egg!  For more information or to
download the library, the website is http://www.visionegg.org/

This directory contains Windows binary executable versions of several
demonstration scripts included with version 0.9.9 of the Vision Egg
library.  These programs are not meant to be used for experiments, but
rather to demonstrate particular features of the Vision Egg.

The complete source code of these programs can be downloaded from the
Vision Egg website.
