This directory contains the source for the Vision Egg documentation.

The bash script BUILD.sh implements the instructions in this file.

The source for the manual is in LaTeX using the classes, styles, and
tools from the Python language documentation itself. These files are
not included with the Vision Egg, but should be copied/linked into the
Vision Egg doc directory.  Link the following directories from the
directory of the same name in the Python documentation source.

html
paper-a4
paper-letter
perl
templates
texinputs
tools

Additionally, create a link called icons that links html/icons.

To make the manual in HTML form, run:

python tools/mkhowto visionegg.tex

In fact, I run:

python tools/mkhowto --iconserver "../images" -s 3 --up-link "http://www.visionegg.org/" --up-title "Vision Egg website" visionegg.tex

To make the manual in PDF form, run:

python tools/mkhowto --pdf visionegg.tex
