Description: Gasket is a simple note taking program I made for gnome. I liked the simplicity of kjots for KDE and the icons in basket (also for KDE). I combined the two into one light GTK program written in 208 lines of clean python code. It still doesn't have all the features I want such as handling hyper links, but it will!
        
        Requires python bindings for gtk and glade to run.
