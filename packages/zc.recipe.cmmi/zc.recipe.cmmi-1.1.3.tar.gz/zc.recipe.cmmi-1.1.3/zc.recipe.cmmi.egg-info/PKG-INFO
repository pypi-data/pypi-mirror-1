        Release History
        ***************
        1.1.3 (2008-06-03)
        ==================
        
        Add support for updating the environment.
        
        1.1.2 (2008-02-28)
        ==================
        
        Bugs Fixed
        ----------
        
        Check if the `location` folder exists before creating it.
        
        After 1.1.0
        ===========
        
        Added support for patches to be downloaded from a url rather than only using
        patches on the filesystem
        
        1.1.0
        =====
        
        Added support for:
        
        - download-cache: downloaded files are cached in the 'cmmi' subdirectory of
        the cache cache keys are hashes of the url that the file was downloaded from
        cache information recorded in the cache.ini file within each directory
        
        - offline mode: cmmi will not go online if the package is not in the cache
        
        - variable location: build files other than in the parts directory if required
        
        - additional logging/output
        
        1.0.2 (2007-06-03)
        ==================
        
        Added support for patches.

        Initial release.
        
        Detailed Documentation
        **********************
        
        We have an archive with a demo foo tar ball:
        
        >>> ls(distros)
        -  foo.tgz
        
        Let's update a sample buildout to installs it:
        
        >>> write('buildout.cfg',
        ... """
        ... [buildout]
        ... parts = foo
        ...
        ... [foo]
        ... recipe = zc.recipe.cmmi
        ... url = file://%s/foo.tgz
        ... """ % distros)
        
        We used the url option to specify the location of the archive.
        
        If we run the buildout, the configure script in the archive is run.
        It creates a make file which is also run:
        
        >>> print system('bin/buildout'),
        Installing foo.
        foo: Downloading .../distros/foo.tgz
        foo: Unpacking and configuring
        configuring foo --prefix=/sample-buildout/parts/foo
        echo building foo
        building foo
        echo installing foo
        installing foo
        
        The recipe also creates the parts directory:
        
        >>> ls(sample_buildout, 'parts')
        d  foo
        
        If we run the buildout again, the update method will be called, which
        does nothing:
        
        >>> print system('bin/buildout'),
        Updating foo.
        
        You can supply extra configure options:
        
        >>> write('buildout.cfg',
        ... """
        ... [buildout]
        ... parts = foo
        ...
        ... [foo]
        ... recipe = zc.recipe.cmmi
        ... url = file://%s/foo.tgz
        ... extra_options = -a -b c
        ... """ % distros)
        
        >>> print system('bin/buildout'),
        Uninstalling foo.
        Installing foo.
        foo: Downloading .../distros/foo.tgz
        foo: Unpacking and configuring
        configuring foo --prefix=/sample-buildout/parts/foo -a -b c
        echo building foo
        building foo
        echo installing foo
        installing foo
        
        The recipe sets the location option, which can be read by other
        recipes, to the location where the part is installed:
        
        >>> cat('.installed.cfg')
        ... # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
        [buildout]
        installed_develop_eggs =
        parts = foo
        <BLANKLINE>
        [foo]
        __buildout_installed__ = /sample-buildout/parts/foo
        ...
        extra_options = -a -b c
        location = /sample-buildout/parts/foo
        ...
        
        It may be necessary to set some environment variables when running configure
        or make. This can be done by adding an environment statement:
        
        >>> write('buildout.cfg',
        ... """
        ... [buildout]
        ... parts = foo
        ...
        ... [foo]
        ... recipe = zc.recipe.cmmi
        ... url = file://%s/foo.tgz
        ... environment =
        ...   CFLAGS=-I/usr/lib/postgresql7.4/include
        ... """ % distros)
        
        
        >>> print system('bin/buildout'),
        Uninstalling foo.
        Installing foo.
        foo: Downloading .../distros/foo.tgz
        foo: Unpacking and configuring
        foo: Updating environment: CFLAGS=-I/usr/lib/postgresql7.4/include
        configuring foo --prefix=/sample_buildout/parts/foo
        echo building foo
        building foo
        echo installing foo
        installing foo
        
        Sometimes it's necessary to patch the sources before building a package.
        You can specify the name of the patch to apply and (optional) patch options:
        
        First of all let's write a patchfile:
        
        >>> import sys
        >>> mkdir('patches')
        >>> write('patches/config.patch',
        ... """--- configure
        ... +++ /dev/null
        ... @@ -1,13 +1,13 @@
        ...  #!%s
        ...  import sys
        ... -print "configuring foo", ' '.join(sys.argv[1:])
        ... +print "configuring foo patched", ' '.join(sys.argv[1:])
        ...
        ...  Makefile_template = '''
        ...  all:
        ... -\techo building foo
        ... +\techo building foo patched
        ...
        ...  install:
        ... -\techo installing foo
        ... +\techo installing foo patched
        ...  '''
        ...
        ...  open('Makefile', 'w').write(Makefile_template)
        ...
        ... """ % sys.executable)
        
        Now let's create a buildout.cfg file. Note: If no patch option is beeing
        passed, -p0 is appended by default.
        
        >>> write('buildout.cfg',
        ... """
        ... [buildout]
        ... parts = foo
        ...
        ... [foo]
        ... recipe = zc.recipe.cmmi
        ... url = file://%s/foo.tgz
        ... patch = ${buildout:directory}/patches/config.patch
        ... patch_options = -p0
        ... """ % distros)
        
        >>> print system('bin/buildout'),
        Uninstalling foo.
        Installing foo.
        foo: Downloading .../distros/foo.tgz
        foo: Unpacking and configuring
        patching file configure
        configuring foo patched --prefix=/sample_buildout/parts/foo
        echo building foo patched
        building foo patched
        echo installing foo patched
        installing foo patched
        
        
        Download Cache
        **************
        The recipe supports use of a download cache in the same way
        as zc.buildout. See downloadcache.txt for details
