As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test see button is enabled action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that some button is enabled
Given
	I go to "button_tests.htm"
When
	#The page finishes loading
Then
	I see "btnEnabled" button is enabled
	And I see "btnEnabled2" button is enabled
	And I see "btnEnabled3" button is enabled
	And I see "btnEnabled4" button is enabled
	And I see "btnEnabled5" button is enabled
	And I see "btnEnabled6" button is enabled
