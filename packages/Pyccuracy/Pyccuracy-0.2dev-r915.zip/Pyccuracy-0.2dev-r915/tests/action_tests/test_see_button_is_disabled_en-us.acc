As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test see button is disabled action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that some button is disabled
Given
	I go to "button_tests.htm"
When
	The page finishes loading
Then
	I see "btnDisabled" button is disabled
	And I see "btnDisabled2" button is disabled
	And I see "btnDisabled3" button is disabled
	And I see "btnDisabled4" button is disabled
	And I see "btnDisabled5" button is disabled
	And I see "btnDisabled6" button is disabled
