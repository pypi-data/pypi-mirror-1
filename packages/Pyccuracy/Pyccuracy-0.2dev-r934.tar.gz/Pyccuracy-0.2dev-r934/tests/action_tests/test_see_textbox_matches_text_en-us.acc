As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test see textbox matches text action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that some page textbox matches text
Given
	I go to "textbox_tests.htm"
When
	The page finishes loading
Then
	I see "txtMatches1" textbox matches "Some large text"
	And I see "txtMatches2" textbox matches "Some large text"
	And I see "txtMatches3" textbox matches "Some large text"
	And I see "txtMatches4" textbox matches "Some large text"
	And I see "txtMatches5" textbox matches "Some large text"
	And I see "txtMatches6" textbox matches "Some large text"
