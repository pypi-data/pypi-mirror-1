As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test do not see div action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that some page div is not there
Given
	I go to "div_tests.htm"
When
	The page finishes loading
Then
	I do not see "divHidden1" div
	And I do not see "divHidden2" div
	And I do not see "divHidden3" div
	And I do not see "divHidden4" div
	And I do not see "divHidden5" div
