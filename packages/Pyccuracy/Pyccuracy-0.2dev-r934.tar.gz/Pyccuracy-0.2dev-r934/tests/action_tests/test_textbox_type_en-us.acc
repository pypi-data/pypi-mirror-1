As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test type text action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that we can type the text in the textboxes
Given
	I go to "textbox_tests.htm"
When
	I fill "txtSomething" textbox with "Monty Python"
	And I fill "txtSomething2" textbox with "Monty Python"
	And I fill "txtSomething3" textbox with "Monty Python"
	And I fill "txtSomethingElse" textbox with "Monty Python"
	And I fill "txtSomethingElse2" textbox with "Monty Python"
	And I fill "txtSomethingElse3" textbox with "Monty Python"
Then
	The textboxes are filled
