As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test do not see button action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that some page button is not there
Given
	I go to "button_tests.htm"
When
	The page finishes loading
Then
	I do not see "btnHidden1" button
	And I do not see "btnHidden2" button
	And I do not see "btnHidden3" button
	And I do not see "btnHidden4" button
	And I do not see "btnHidden5" button
	And I do not see "btnHidden6" button
	And I do not see "btnHidden7" button
	And I do not see "btnHidden8" button
	And I do not see "btnHidden9" button
	And I do not see "btnHidden10" button
	And I do not see "btnHidden11" button
	And I do not see "btnHidden12" button
