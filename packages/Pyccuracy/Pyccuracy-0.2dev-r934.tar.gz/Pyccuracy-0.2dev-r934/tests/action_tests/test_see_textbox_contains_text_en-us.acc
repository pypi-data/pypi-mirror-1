As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test see textbox contains text action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that some page textbox contains text
Given
	I go to "textbox_tests.htm"
When
	The page finishes loading
Then
	I see "txtContains1" textbox contains "large"
	And I see "txtContains2" textbox contains "large"
	And I see "txtContains3" textbox contains "large"
	And I see "txtContains4" textbox contains "large"
	And I see "txtContains5" textbox contains "large"
	And I see "txtContains6" textbox contains "large"
