As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test do not see checkbox action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that some page checkbox is not there
Given
	I go to "checkbox_tests.htm"
When
	The page finishes loading
Then
	I do not see "chkHidden1" checkbox
    And I do not see "chkHidden2" checkbox
    And I do not see "chkHidden3" checkbox
    And I do not see "chkHidden4" checkbox
