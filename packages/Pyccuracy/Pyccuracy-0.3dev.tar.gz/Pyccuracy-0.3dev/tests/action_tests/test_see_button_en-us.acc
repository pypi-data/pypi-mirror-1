As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test see button action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that google's search button is there
Given
	I go to "button_tests.htm"
When
	#The page finishes loading
Then
	I see "btnSomething" button
	And I see "btnSomething2" button
	And I see "btnSomething3" button
	And I see "btnSomethingElse" button
	And I see "btnSomethingElse2" button
	And I see "btnSomethingElse3" button
