As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test the checkbox is not checked action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that a given checkbox is not checked
Given
	I go to "checkbox_tests.htm"
When
	#The Page finishes loading
Then
	I see the "chkUnchecked" checkbox is not checked
	And I see the "chkUnchecked2" checkbox is not checked
