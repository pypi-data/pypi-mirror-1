As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test see checkbox action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that some page checkbox is there
Given
	I go to "checkbox_tests.htm"
When
	#The page finishes loading
Then
	I see "chkSomething" checkbox
	And I see "chkSomethingElse" checkbox
