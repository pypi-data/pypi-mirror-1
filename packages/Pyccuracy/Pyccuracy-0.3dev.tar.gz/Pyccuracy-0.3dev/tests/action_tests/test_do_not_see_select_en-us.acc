As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test see select action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that some page's select is there
Given
	I go to "select_tests.htm"
When
	#The page finishes loading
Then
	I do not see "invisibleSelect1" select
	And I do not see "invisibleSelect2" select
	And I do not see "invisibleSelect3" select
	And I do not see "invisibleSelect4" select
	And I do not see "invisibleSelect5" select
