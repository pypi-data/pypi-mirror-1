As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test see link is disabled action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that some page link is disabled
Given
	I go to "link_tests.htm"
When
	#The page finishes loading
Then
	I see "lnkDisabled" link is disabled
	And I see "lnkDisabled2" link is disabled
