As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test see textbox action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that some page textbox is there
Given
	I go to "textbox_tests.htm"
When
	#The page finishes loading
Then
	I see "txtSomething" textbox
	And I see "txtSomethingElse" textbox
	And I see "txtSomething2" textbox
	And I see "txtSomethingElse2" textbox
	And I see "txtSomething3" textbox
	And I see "txtSomethingElse3" textbox
