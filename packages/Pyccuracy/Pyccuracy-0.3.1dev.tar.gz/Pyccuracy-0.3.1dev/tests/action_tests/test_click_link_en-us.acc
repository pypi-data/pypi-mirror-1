As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test the click link action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that we can click a link by name
Given
	I go to "link_tests.htm"
When
	I click "lnkItWorks" link
Then
	I see "It Works!" title
	
Scenario 2 - Checking that we can click a link by id
Given
	I go to "link_tests.htm"
When
	I click "lnkItWorks2" link
Then
	I see "It Works!" title
