As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test the wait for page to load action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that after clicking an image we can wait for page to load
Given
	I go to "page_tests.htm"
When
	I click "imgSubmit" image
	And I wait for the page to load
Then
	I see "It Works!" title
	
Scenario 2 - Checking that after clicking an image we can wait for page to load for a given number of seconds
Given
	I go to "page_tests.htm"
When
	I click "imgSubmit" image
	And I wait for the page to load for 10 seconds
Then
	I see "It Works!" title
