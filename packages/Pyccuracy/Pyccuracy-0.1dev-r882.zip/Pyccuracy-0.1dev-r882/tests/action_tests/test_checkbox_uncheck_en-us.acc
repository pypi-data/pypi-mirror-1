As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test the uncheck checkbox action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that a given checkbox gets unchecked
Given
	I go to "checkbox_tests.htm"
When
	I uncheck the "chkChecked" checkbox
	And I uncheck the "chkChecked2" checkbox
Then
	I see the "chkChecked" checkbox is not checked
	And I see the "chkChecked2" checkbox is not checked
