As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test selecting an option by index
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Changing the selected index of a select to 1
Given
	I go to "select_tests.htm"
When
	I select the option with index of 1 in "selSecondIndex" select
	And I select the option with index of 1 in "selSecondIndex2" select
Then
	I see "selSecondIndex" select has selected index of 1
	And I see "selSecondIndex2" select has selected index of 1
