pyaggregator

pyaggregator is supposed to take the tedious portion of writing an
aggregator away, and letting you decide how you're going to store the
data and let you handle the portions of aggregating the content you want
that only you know how to do.

pyaggregator can use any backend for the data, and comes with an Elixir
backend for those that want to see how to do it or for those who haven't
yet decided on their model.  But, chances are, you're going to want to
model additional information about the posts and entries, and you can
put in any model by implementing a few simple methods.

pyaggregator started as a genericised version of the feed collection and
entry creation from FeedJack <http://feedjack.org/>, an aggregator for
Django <http://djangoproject.com/>, which is written primarily by
Gustavo Pic√≥n.  The FeedJack code is available under a two-clause BSD
license (see LICENSE).
