<description><![CDATA[Well the title is a two way plead. First up, my total lack of motivation to ride over weekends. Instead of Saturdays league race, I opted to just have a decent coffee ride with Theo and a few guys. Went out in to Durbanville Hills and had a awesome 3hr ride. Stopped for coffee afterwards and then headed home. I had a odd incident half way. The bike was making horrible noises, and ended up being the chain-blade bolts coming lose. don't ask me how that happened. Luckily got them tightened but one snapped (some shitty make), so afterwards headed to Cycles Direct to buy a new set of bolts. Hopefully it won't happen again.<br /><br />Sunday I slept in a bit and then eventually convinced myself to head out for a ride. Just past Camps Bay I met up with the Pinnacle Point guys and went for coffee. They managed to win Mykonos and the league overall so were quite chuffed with themselves. Went home afterwards with only about 67km's on the clock.<br /><br />Second part of the title!: This morning I ride to work, and behold, another puncture. Either the roads are getting worse, or it's the Continental UltraSport training tyres I use. It's almost a puncture every week. Last week I thought I was lucky and didn't get one, but it didn't last. Strange though, but my motivation to ride in the week isn't lacking. Just don't seem to feel like riding on the weekends...]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The longer one holds onto a memory, the longer one lives in <br />the past. A past which can't be buried. A past which can not <br />be shaken. The deeper the memory they hold onto, the more <br />beautiful the past will become. The beautiful memories will <br />eventually turn into hate. Even if they look ahead, they lose <br />the ability to walk forward. As long as the heavy chain called <br />Revenge continues to fill the heart.<br />]]></description>

						<title>It had to happen sometime..</title>
<link>http://www.lactic-haze.net/news.php?item.245.2</link>
<description><![CDATA[Riding home yesterday through Rondebosch, two lanes of one road become a single lane after one of the intersections. It's always a dodgy part of the road but nothing really bad as drivers just yield to each other and form one lane. Yesterday a lady in a VW Gholf Chico decided she didn't want to yield to someone else, and tried to overtake. Failing to get enough speed she suddenly slammed on the brakes, and moved to the left. Problem!: I was on her left so had to suddenly brake and swerve to my left as well to avoid her. Unfortunately there was a pavement in the way, and while I barely missed the side of her car, I slammed in to the rear and the pavement. Knee is bruised and scraped, but nothing else damaged that will keep me off the bike. Managed to get up quick enough and ran to her driver-side door to give her a good talking to but she was so shocked she just sped off... Oh well, I can still ride, and the bike didn't get damaged.]]></description>

						<title>RSS Fixed &amp; Chainwheel</title>
<link>http://www.lactic-haze.net/news.php?item.244.1</link>
<description><![CDATA[Ok, the RSS feeds on the left have been fixed. Couldn't understand why they weren't working, then discovered I needed to patch the actual plugin. Once patched, it seems fine. I tested it, and works now.<br /><br />On other news, I managed to convince Graham Brankin to let me run the <a class='bbcode' href='www.chainwheel.co.za'>www.chainwheel.co.za</a> website. Installed the same back-end I use for this page, and currently use the same theme. I'm still looking for a different but clean theme that will work well with the site. Only extra's are banner adverts (I have some sponsors that will help pay the hosting), and extra pages for training information etc. The DNS should get done later this week and then it's full-steam ahead!]]></description>

						<title>Easter Weekend Riding</title>
<link>http://www.lactic-haze.net/news.php?item.243.2</link>
<description><![CDATA[With two extra days to the weekend, Easter weekend is meant to be any cyclists training bliss. Four days of being able to just ride and train. Unfortunately if you're a cyclist without a goal in the near future, the motivation of riding and training is sometimes just not there. Friday I was scheduled to ride with Nick Coyne. Woke up to a howling wind, but he wouldn't hear any of my protests and we went training anyway. Got blown around by a howling South-Easter. Only managed 80km's in total. There was no way I was staying out in the wind any longer.<br /><br />Saturday I missed a scheduled ride due to being extremely hung-over from a rather late BBQ at Theo's place. Only dragged myself out of bed at 1pm. Sunday I was scheduled to do a mtb ride with Nick but bailed, and eventually went out at 9am. Caught up with Lance from UCT and just went to the top of Chapmans Peak and back. 104km's for the day at a leasurely pace.<br /><br />Today was a different story. Met up with Nick again, and caught some of the Cycles Direct guys and joined them. All of them were on PowerTap devices, and each one had some shitty amount of watts to avg etc. Up LLundudno climb it was a all-out sprint fest as the guys took to trying to out-do each other. Now when you're hitting 98kg's on the scale and 66kg climbers start playing, it gets painful! Luckily later on Chapmans Peak they took it easier, but on the way back we had a nice through and off line working until the coffee stop. From there all the way home Nick was pacing on the front watching his PowerTap while I was sitting out of the wind being a lazy bastard. Got home with a 31km/h avg, so a hard enough ride.]]></description>

						<title>A distinct lack of motivation</title>
<link>http://www.lactic-haze.net/news.php?item.241.2</link>
<description><![CDATA[Suffered from a distinct lack of motivation over the weekend. Basically Friday night was spent watching <strong class='bbcode bold'>300</strong> on the big screen. Awesome movie! I was doing Vinge-a-Vinge with Luanne (Cashandra Slingerland's sister) on Saturday morning, since she got us free entries. It was her first race so only did the 21km with her. Almost fell asleep on the course. On the uphills I took to running up with both our bikes while she slowly walked etc. Still, was a stunning course, and I was a bit jealous of the guys doing the long route. Took us over 2hrs to do 21km's, then we watched the finish of the Cape Epic. While I wouldn't mind doing the Epic one year, I've pretty much put the hope of it actually happening to one side. Financially it's almost impossible. While I have the Blur, I would still need to spend around R6000 to just get it ready for the Epic, and thats excluding the entry fee etc. Not going to happen in the next few years (fuck am I regretting buying property!!). Seems we're faced with another possible interest rate increase in April.<br /><br />Back to Sunday. I didn't set an alarm...wasn't able to rustle up anyone to ride with on Saturday, so thought I'd just get up and do 100km's on my own. Woke up...decided to lie in for a bit contemplating riding. The levels of motivation just went downhill from there. Eventually had a shower, and decided to skip riding altogether. Spent the whole day playing EVE-Online, and did the McDonalds thing for lunch. Watched some cricket later the evening and didn't feel guilty about not riding. Cycled to work this morning, and felt good. Don't know what was up yesterday...will see how the rest of the week goes and the coming long weekend. I suspect it might be the distinct lack of a goal in the near future, since I'm unsure where I'll find myself in the next few months, so can't exactly make plans for SA Champs.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Got offered a job in Johannesburg. Unfortunately the pay isn't worth the effort. I would have driven the small increase in pay out to work and back alone. The rest of the facilities the place offered wouldn't have been to bad, but alas, I'm now after money. Not much else has been happening. I'm back in my old training routines...riding to work in the dark. I always felt like that was real training. Training when you know no-one else is around, or they're all sitting in cars on the way to work etc. It's getting colder in the mornings as well. Winter is slowly heading here. Definately need to invest in some better long finger gloves this season.]]></description>

						<title>Geard Ride - Malmesbury</title>
<link>http://www.lactic-haze.net/news.php?item.239.2</link>
<description><![CDATA[Drove out to Malmesbury for the Geard Pharmacy league event on Saturday. Couldn't really say I felt good about the race, or that I anticipated it to be a good event, so wasn't planning anything specific, just a "finish with the bunch" would have been fine. To give you an indication of my state of mind, I had a nice meaty pizza and a coke for supper Friday night. Not exactly the pre-race meal of champions. With our team captain Geddan Ruddock away at the Cape Epic, it was pretty much open season for us. Pinnacle Point had the yellow jersey and wanted to make sure they kept it. I had a good chuckle when Riaan Joubert asked me on the line "please can you wait at least 30km's today before attacking?"<br /><br />Well...I waited...3km's. The bunch was just dawdling along, and I had an itch, so attacked. Pinnacle was on to us like shit to a blanket. Every time we tried a move they would send two guys, just so there is someone to respond to the counter. This didn't mean I was going to give up and lie down. They are only human, and they had to get tired at some stage. Pretty much most of the race involved me or one of the other two Manic Cycles guys trying to get away, with Pinnacle Point bringing us back. Some of the other teams tried to a lesser extent, but weren't nearly as active as we were. Theo told me after the race when I attacked in the last 15km's again, he heard Neil Bradford (last season's league winner) going "fuck! there he goes again!!" That put a smile on my face.<br /><br />In the last 10km's I went with Shaun Le Roux from my old team (Arauma Carriers) and one Pinnacle Point rider followed. We were going at 44-45km/h in to a headwind trying to get away from the bunch, and I bled.  Unfortunately the bunch had different ideas, and the chase was on. We lost a lot of rhythm and momentum going through the town, and were caught just as we took the last left hand turn up to the finish line, probably 200m from the finish. I'm still tasting blood in my throat...]]></description>
