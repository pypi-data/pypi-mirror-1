    <title>TGOpenIDLogin moved Google Code</title>
    <link>http://nxsy.org/blog/archives/2007/04/24/tgopenidlogin-moved-google-code</link>
    <pubDate>Tue, 24 Apr 2007 19:12:39 GMT</pubDate>
    <description>&lt;p>I&amp;#39;ve moved &lt;a href="/code/tgopenidlogin/">TGOpenIDLogin&lt;/a> onto &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/">Google Code&lt;/a> so that the source code repository is accessible and other people can work on it.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;#39;ve also created a &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/tgopenidlogin-discuss">TGOpenIDLogin discussion&lt;/a> group, in case someone actually ends up using it and wants to know some things about it. &lt;/p>&lt;p>(TGOpenIDLogin is a &lt;a href="http://turbogears.org/">TurboGears&lt;/a> module that you can use to add &lt;a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID&lt;/a> logins to your TurboGears application without too much fuss.&amp;nbsp; A &lt;a href="/blog/archives/2007/03/26/tgopenidlogin---an-openid-consumer-for-turbogears-applications">previous post&lt;/a> has information on how to use it.)&lt;/p></description>

    <title>iCommons Bring 'n Braai reportback</title>
    <link>http://nxsy.org/blog/archives/2007/04/23/icommons-bring-n-braai-reportback</link>
    <pubDate>Mon, 23 Apr 2007 16:44:58 GMT</pubDate>
    <description>&lt;p>After a somewhat depressing Digital Freedom Expo, it was great to see the energy that &lt;a href="http://ubuntu.typepad.com/">Heather Ford&lt;/a> and her &lt;a href="http://icommons.org/people/">colleagues&lt;/a> (Hi Kerryn! Daniella!) at &lt;a href="http://icommons.org/">iCommons&lt;/a> had and evoked at the &lt;a href="http://www.icommons.org/bringnbraai/">Bring 'n Braai&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>One of the greatest thing about the event is that I had multiple distinct groups of friends attending.  I was not just my "open source conference attendees anonymous" friends, or just my "&lt;a href="http://www.clug.org.za/">CLUG&lt;/a>" friends, but also the friends interested in technology that just don't normally do events, and even more impressively, friends that aren't even particularly interested in the technology itself, but were attracted by the implications of &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons&lt;/a> as a movement and on their own lives.  (Oh, and there were those blogging geeks who'll attend anything to get a few hits by writing a reportback.  Weirdos.)&lt;br/>&lt;/p>&lt;p>If I've become very disillusioned about the attitudes of those involved in Free and Open Source Software in South Africa, Creative Commons seems to offer something that has applicability and value to a broad part of the population, and the key message of Read Write culture is one that differs from the continuing focus by many stakeholders in Free and Open Source Software in South Africa on the &lt;strong>use&lt;/strong> of such software, and no provision or support or education or recognition for the &lt;strong>creation&lt;/strong> of such software locally.&lt;/p>&lt;p>So, thanks Heather and Kerryn and Daniella and everyone else from iCommons, and also to &lt;a href="http://www.daveduarte.co.za/">Dave&lt;/a> for MCing, for relief from the apathy I've been feeling for the past six months, and I hope that this event leads to more creators and creation of content, and thus to more reason to come together to savour the output of our creators and their belief in sharing, re-using, and remixing.&lt;/p>&lt;/hr></description>

    <title>Gibe now generally available</title>
    <link>http://nxsy.org/blog/archives/2007/04/19/gibe-now-generally-available</link>
    <pubDate>Thu, 19 Apr 2007 23:53:52 GMT</pubDate>
    <description>&lt;p>After much poking, cajoling, and downright finger pointing and laughing by &lt;a href="http://bryndivey.co.za/">Bryn&lt;/a> and a bunch of other "friends", I now have &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/gibe/">Gibe&lt;/a>, the little project saving my sanity from the tedium of burn-out and under-stimulation, in a publically accessible place for more people to do more finger pointing and laughing.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Gibe is just your standard web log software - people can log in and add posts, other people can read the posts and make comments on them, and there's anti-spam (using &lt;a href="http://akismet.com/">akismet&lt;/a>) and there's also a bit of a beginnings of a &lt;a href="/blog/archives/2007/04/03/gibe-plugin-system-taking-shape">plugin architecture&lt;/a> there for people who want to expand it beyond what it does now.&lt;/p>&lt;p> &lt;/p>&lt;/hr></description>

    <title>Another sociable week in Cape Town...</title>
    <link>http://nxsy.org/blog/archives/2007/04/17/another-sociable-week-in-cape-town</link>
    <pubDate>Tue, 17 Apr 2007 20:31:03 GMT</pubDate>
    <description>&lt;p>Unlike the &lt;a href="/blog/archives/2007/03/26/week-of-being-a-sociable-geek">previous sociable week&lt;/a>, this week is somewhat less about meeting other technical geeks and more for empowering the masses through teaching about open source and open content.&amp;nbsp; Well, it&amp;#39;s all really just an excuse to meet people, so I&amp;#39;ll be tagging along. &lt;/p>&lt;p>The &lt;a href="http://digitalfreedom.uwc.ac.za/">Digital Freedom Expo&lt;/a> (I&amp;#39;ve mentioned it before) is being held at the University of Western Cape on Thursday and Friday, and features international speakers like &lt;a href="http://lessig.org/">Lawrence Lessig&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Wales">Jimmy Wales&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Behlendorf">Brian Behlendorf&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/">Philip Greenspun&lt;/a>.&amp;nbsp; Local speakers include &lt;a href="http://ubuntu.typepad.com/">Heather Ford&lt;/a> (representing &lt;a href="http://icommons.org/">iCommons&lt;/a>), &lt;a href="http://www.silentcoder.co.za/">A.J. Venter&lt;/a> (former &lt;a href="http://www.getopenlab.com/">OpenLab&lt;/a> lead developer), and Bob Jolliffe (talking about &lt;a href="http://www.ftisa.org.za/">Freedom to Innovate&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>&lt;p>On Friday night, there&amp;#39;s the iCommons &lt;a href="http://www.icommons.org/bringnbraai/">Bring &amp;#39;n Braai&lt;/a>, where Lessig and Wales will talk more about open content to a wider selection of society - and where local creators of content will learn about and show off their open content.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;#39;s at the &lt;a href="http://www.armchairtheatre.co.za/">Independent Armchair Theatre&lt;/a> from 8pm. &lt;/p>&lt;p>On Saturday, the &lt;a href="http://ubuntu-za.org/">Ubuntu-ZA community&lt;/a> will be having a meet-up that happens also to have become the &lt;a href="http://ubuntu-za.org/Wiki/CapeTownTeam/FeistyReleaseParty">Cape Town Feisty Release Party&lt;/a>. Come have a drink and chat with fellow Ubuntu users at San Marcos at the Cape Town Waterfront from 2pm.&lt;/p>&lt;p>(And if you&amp;#39;re &lt;a href="http://microformats.org/">microformats&lt;/a>-enabled, you can just pick all the event details up automatically from the post page.&amp;nbsp; More on that later...)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></description>
