What exactly is the point behind &lt;a href="http://rssza.com/" rel="external"&gt;RSSza&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Afrigator and Amatomu (in alphabetical order) came along we were all very excited. But now I have to be honest that the idea is starting to wear out a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RSSza has a manual feed approval system. You send them a mail (yes, a mail) and then they will consider if they will include your feed into the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like they are only looking for "great feeds relating to South Africa". Does this blog qualify? Probably not, then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So unless RSSza is aiming to gain an advantage through the quality factor, I don't see how they are going to catch on. What exactly are they giving us that Afrigator or Amatomu are not giving us already?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, it's easy to &lt;a href="http://nxsy.org/blog/archives/2007/04/25/writing-an-aggregator-in-a-few-easy-steps" rel="external" title="Writing an aggregator in a few easy steps..."&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; an &lt;a href="http://nxsy.org/blog/archives/2007/04/26/building-an-aggregator-part-two-core-aggregation-logic" rel="external" title="Building an aggregator part two, core aggregation logic"&gt;aggregator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another random question: why are all of these services (Afrigator, Amatomu, RSSza) using the &lt;code&gt;com&lt;/code&gt; &lt;abbr title="generic Top Level Domain"&gt;gTLD&lt;/abbr&gt; instead of something under the &lt;code&gt;za&lt;/code&gt; &lt;abbr title="country-code Top Level Domain"&gt;ccTLD&lt;/abbr&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, why didn't I know about &lt;a href="http://blik.co.za/" rel="external"&gt;Blik&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://blogafrikaans.co.za/" rel="external"&gt;BlogAfrikaans&lt;/a&gt; before? :)&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Finally, here is the details for our next &lt;span class="summary"&gt;myXchange&lt;/span&gt; meeting:&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;abbr class="dtstart" title="2007-05-16T18:30:00+02:00"&gt;Date: Wednesday, 16 May 2007 from 18:30&lt;/abbr&gt; until &lt;abbr class="dtend" title="2007-05-16T23:99:99+02:00"&gt;late&lt;/abbr&gt; (or whenever you need to get back to the wife and kids) ;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Location: &lt;span class="location"&gt;Upstairs at Harrys above Spar in York Street, George&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;As usual, please add yourself to the &lt;a href="http://myxchange.pbwiki.com/" rel="external" class="url"&gt;wiki page&lt;/a&gt; / leave a comment / &lt;a href="mailto:charlvn@charlvn.za.net"&gt;mail me&lt;/a&gt; if you are interested in coming. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

We had seven people there, which is a new record for our group so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is especially surprising considering that a major cricket match was on. One of my colleagues told me the score but I didn't understand it; he just said that all I need to know is that it's flipping terrible. (Yes, &lt;a href="http://blog.charlvn.za.net/2007/03/cricket.html"&gt;I don't watch cricket&lt;/a&gt;; I code.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently the South Africans got beaten quite badly so maybe people came for some cheering up. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But naturally it's not about the quantity but about the &lt;em&gt;quality&lt;/em&gt; and in that respect I think we are definitely going into the right direction!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following people attended (in alphabetical order):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.feistyfemale.com/" rel="external"&gt;Bev&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://imel.co.za/" rel="external"&gt;Imel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://designsignature.co.za/blog/" rel="external"&gt;Jayx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Leroy&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://jdlprinting.co.za/" rel="external"&gt;Louis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://stii.za.net/" rel="external"&gt;Stii&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks all for coming - it was &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of fun! A specially big welcome to our three new members: Bev, Leroy and Louis! Hope to see you all at our next meeting in three weeks' time. I'll make an announcement to confirm the date and venue soon (and also put it in &lt;a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcalendar" rel="external"&gt;hCalendar&lt;/a&gt; format so that you can easily import it into &lt;a href="http://calendar.google.com/" rel="external"&gt;Google Calendar&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/4106" rel="external"&gt;Operator&lt;/a&gt; or whatever else you like to do / use).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we are thinking about holding another &lt;a href="http://www.geekdinner.org.za/" rel="external"&gt;Geek Dinner&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="http://27dinner.pbwiki.com/" rel="external"&gt;27dinner&lt;/a&gt; in the Garden Route. So far, we have been thinking about holding it on Saturday, 2 June 2007 (in which case it won't really qualify as a 27dinner so it'll have to be a Geek Dinner) but this has not been fixed yet. We are only in the beginning of the planning phase; Bev and I have been given the task to follow up on some candidate venues. There are quite a few nice options (this &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the Garden Route after all) but I will blog some more about this as soon as I have updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that is naturally very important is to keep our friends over in Cape Town and Johannesburg in mind. Without you guys, the Garden Route Geek Dinners just would not be the same. When will it suit you guys? And then another important question I would like to ask: do you happen to play golf? :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't worry if you suck at it; however badly you bugger up the game, you can't possibly play worse than me! Maybe we should have an ama-croco-croco team (not for the physically disabled but for the ball-sense disabled like me) that will be the last to enter the field. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well, you can't hack until 02:00 in the morning and still be expected to excel at sports. :P&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going to be moving the &lt;a href="http://www.freedomtoaster.org/?q=node/67" rel="external"&gt;George Freedom Toaster&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://jdlprinting.co.za/" rel="external"&gt;JDL Printing&lt;/a&gt; on the corner of Market and Meade Streets. It is currently just not getting enough exposure standing in a very closed environment and we just need to let it do what it's been made to do: market itself to the maximum of its own capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was very busy today fighting a deadline so the others beat me senseless when it came to blogging:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.feistyfemale.com/?p=147" rel="external"&gt;FeistyFemale Â» My first MyExchange meeting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://stii.za.net/archives/191" rel="external"&gt;stii.za.net Â» Another AWESOME myXchange gathering!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://designsignature.co.za/blog/?p=5" rel="external"&gt;the mad hatters funeral Â» myXchange has a seXchange (of sorts)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.feistyfemale.com/?p=149" rel="external"&gt;FeistyFemale Â» Aftermath of Xchange meeting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this order is correct according to the time of posting, but maybe it's off because some people's blogs report time on a different timezone than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But thanks all; am really glad to see so many posts about the meetings! Keeping it real and doing things the social web style. ;)&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.charlvn.za.net/2007/04/myxchange-on-25th-now-were-talking.html'></link><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://blog.charlvn.za.net/feeds/posts/default/9094516106544246212'></link><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6950106/posts/default/9094516106544246212'></link><author><name>Charl van Niekerk</name></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6950106.post-4114927457801450397</id><published>2007-04-26T07:31:00.000Z</published><updated>2007-04-26T07:39:41.858Z</updated><title type='text'>Free Afrigator T-Shirts</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;This morning from the &lt;a href="http://blog.afrigator.com/" rel="external"&gt;Afrigator blog&lt;/a&gt; in their post &lt;a href="http://blog.afrigator.com/2007/04/26/win-an-apple-ipod-with-afrigator/" rel="external"&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Win an Apple iPod with Afrigator&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be working on Joomla 1.5 Beta 2 so we are currently waiting for that to be released before we can think about starting to code. Therefore I am spending the time to refine my project plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://forge.joomla.org/" rel="external"&gt;Joomlaforge&lt;/a&gt; is now &lt;a href="http://dev.joomla.org/component/option,com_jd-wp/Itemid,33/p,311/" rel="external"&gt;migrating&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://joomlacode.org/" rel="external"&gt;Joomlacode&lt;/a&gt;. Interesting stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://tectonic.co.za/view.php?id=1455" rel="external"&gt;Tectonic article&lt;/a&gt; got syndicated to &lt;a href="http://www.ioltechnology.co.za/article_page.php?iArticleId=3787128" rel="external"&gt;IOL Technology&lt;/a&gt; which in turn got syndicated to &lt;a href="http://www.gardenroute.com/content/view/2459/51/" rel="external"&gt;GardenRoute.com&lt;/a&gt;. This sparked a &lt;a href="http://forum.gardenroute.com/showthread.php?t=1012" rel="external"&gt;forum thread&lt;/a&gt; which sparked &lt;a href="http://mybroadband.co.za/vb/showthread.php?t=72635" rel="external"&gt;another forum thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet haven't heard about any other students in Africa. Hopefully that will all change next year. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an African mentor organisation point of view, I know &lt;a href="http://wordforge.org/" rel="external"&gt;WordForge&lt;/a&gt; was one last year. I hope next year both WordForge and &lt;a href="http://freedomtoaster.org/" rel="external"&gt;Freedom Toaster&lt;/a&gt; will be mentoring organisations. I'm sure there's some other great open source efforts in Africa that should also apply. I think the Joomla dev community is extremely friendly and it's been a real pleasure so far so I'll probably be applying to Joomla again though. But one can submit up to 20 proposals so I'll see about that next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a &lt;a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/microformats-discuss@microformats.org/msg07317.html" rel="external"&gt;thread on the microformats-discuss&lt;/a&gt; mailing list; obviously &lt;a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/microformats-discuss@microformats.org/msg07318.html" rel="external"&gt;I replied&lt;/a&gt; and there was also a &lt;a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/microformats-discuss@microformats.org/msg07319.html" rel="external"&gt;reply by Terrell Russell&lt;/a&gt;; however, I didn't get as much feedback as I hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a blog post by devkungfoo titled &lt;a href="http://www.devkungfoo.com/?p=118" rel="external"&gt;Joomla Presentation Standardisation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am networking a bit with some of my fellow Joomla GSoC students. I had a particularly interesting discussion with &lt;a href="http://deviantdev.com/" rel="external"&gt;DeviantDev&lt;/a&gt; the other day. We were speaking about syndication over instant messaging as well as integrated and distributed social web services. But more on that another day. :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.charlvn.za.net/2007/04/gsoc-update-3.html'></link><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://blog.charlvn.za.net/feeds/posts/default/4157386696189364439'></link><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6950106/posts/default/4157386696189364439'></link><author><name>Charl van Niekerk</name></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6950106.post-4200275996376185402</id><published>2007-04-25T00:35:00.000Z</published><updated>2007-04-25T12:54:50.589Z</updated><title type='text'>Democracy Player</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I have been using this for a couple of months now and I can't believe that I haven't blogged about this yet. &lt;a href="http://www.getdemocracy.com/" rel="external"&gt;Democracy Player&lt;/a&gt; is an open source cross-platform media player. It runs on Linux, Mac OS X and even Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a package available for Ubuntu Edgy but unfortunately not for Ubuntu Dapper. That is kind-of ridiculous because Dapper is the &lt;abbr title="Long Term Support"&gt;LTS&lt;/abbr&gt; one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason I started using it is because it allows me to download YouTube videos to my local hard drive.

He is involved in building &lt;a href="http://www.radiusim.com/" rel="external"&gt;radiusIM&lt;/a&gt;. He actually pointed me to two sites, &lt;a href="http://feedcrier.com/" rel="external"&gt;Feed Crier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://rasasa.com/" rel="external"&gt;Rasasa&lt;/a&gt; that are attempting to do something very similar. It's really funny that I never knew of either of these before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although these look very interesting, they are far too limited if you ask me. I want to expand this concept and create a real &lt;em&gt;solution&lt;/em&gt; out of it. I have been speaking to some people this afternoon and things are really looking up for the project, but that's all I'm saying for now. :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.charlvn.za.net/2007/04/syndication-over-instant-messaging.html'></link><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://blog.charlvn.za.net/feeds/posts/default/5460694431006013369'></link><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6950106/posts/default/5460694431006013369'></link><author><name>Charl van Niekerk</name></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6950106.post-125575785054237454</id><published>2007-04-24T04:32:00.000Z</published><updated>2007-04-24T16:35:17.941Z</updated><title type='text'>Freedom Toaster Map</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I can't believe I never blogged about this. I have been searching through my archives but couldn't find anything that mentions the &lt;a href="http://freedomtoaster.org/map/" rel="external"&gt;Freedom Toaster Map&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is already actually quite an old project of mine I completed last year for the Ã¼ber-cool &lt;a href="http://freedomtoaster.org/" rel="external"&gt;Freedom Toaster&lt;/a&gt; project. I think it's a lot of fun to play with the &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/apis/maps/" rel="external"&gt;Google Maps API&lt;/a&gt; because it's actually quite powerful (although far from perfect, as anything else).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I wrote a little &lt;a href="http://freedomtoaster.org/map/map.js" rel="external" type="application/javascript"&gt;script&lt;/a&gt; that reads an &lt;a href="http://freedomtoaster.org/map/map.xml" rel="external" type="application/xml"&gt;XML file&lt;/a&gt; containing the info of all the toasters. Then it simply populates the map and voila!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the script is really simple, it actually took a bit of figuring out. Luckily now it's out there for others to look at and learn from. I'm sure there's lots of people that want to do similar things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the map is far from complete, I would love to get the coordinates of more toasters. If you could help me out, please do! :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.charlvn.za.net/2007/04/freedom-toaster-map.html'></link><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://blog.charlvn.za.net/feeds/posts/default/125575785054237454'></link><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6950106/posts/default/125575785054237454'></link><author><name>Charl van Niekerk</name></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6950106.post-6976950261020261474</id><published>2007-04-23T03:44:00.000Z</published><updated>2007-04-23T15:46:13.788Z</updated><title type='text'>Why South African Web 2.0 Projects Will Win!</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I think there is a great future for South African Web 2.0 projects. Why? Simply because they listen to their users. And that's what overseas services seem to lack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, look at how quickly somebody from &lt;a href="http://www.zoopy.com/" rel="external"&gt;Zoopy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://blog.charlvn.za.net/2007/04/zoopy-embedded-videos.html#c812591959480639134"&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="http://blog.charlvn.za.net/2007/04/zoopy-embedded-videos.html"&gt;my post about their embedding markup&lt;/a&gt;. Would you see that from YouTube? For sure not!!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had contact with Neville Newey from &lt;a href="http://muti.co.za/" rel="external"&gt;Muti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://justinhartman.com" rel="external"&gt;Justin Hartman&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://afrigator.com/" rel="external"&gt;Afrigator&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://vincentmaher.com" rel="external"&gt;Vincent Maher&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://amatomu.com" rel="external"&gt;Amatomu&lt;/a&gt; and now Jason from Zoopy. They have all been extremely positive about my feedback and my blog articles. They are all extremely cool people. And most of all, they are all &lt;em&gt;involved&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conditions in South Africa are not ideal, especially not for high-tech projects. We lack many of the basics (such as half-decent internet access) that most people in other countries (even in many other "developing countries") take for granted. If we managed to do all this with so many hardships, just imagine what we could do once we get our internet access and the crime sorted! Oh my goodness, I don't even want to start thinking right now... I better go home before I get too excited. :)&lt;/p&gt;

This is majorly cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I can now do is I can write a script and as soon as somebody posts a new link, my script will be triggered along with the info of the new link. The possibilities are endless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do I want to do? What I wanted to do all along: write a Jabber bot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jabber bot sits on a server like &lt;code&gt;jabber.obsidian.co.za&lt;/code&gt;. If that would be possible, I would even like to have it sit on its own dedicated Jabber server that would make it independent of Obsidian's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly there is a web interface. The users can register and log into the web interface. They can select whatever they want to be notified of. Some possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Subscribe to any RSS/Atom feed (be notified of a new item on any of these feeds) - almost like Bloglines but through the open XML-based and therefore very extensible XMPP protocol&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Get regular weather updates for your area&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Subscribe to tags on Muti or Amatomu or Afrigator or Technorati and be notified of new items posted under any of these tags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hook script on Muti sends some kind of message to the server running the Jabber bot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The users of my system just provide me with their Jabber ids. Then a short authentication process follows to make sure they are indeed the owners of those ids to prevent abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then as the stuff comes in they just get notified. As simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nice thing about this is that you can get notifications on your PC, on your mobile, or with anything else that can interoperate with Jabber. That includes Google Talk, naturally, which vastly expands your network. One can even start to support some proprietary protocols later on such as MSN. There are many open source libraries (even python ones like &lt;a href="http://auriga.wearlab.de/~alb/msnlib/" rel="external"&gt;msnlib&lt;/a&gt;) that could possibly be used for this purpose. I don't know of much for Skype yet and ICQ is anyway not that popular anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bandwidth efficiency is a major advantage when it comes to instant messaging. Let's say you are subscribed to 50 feeds from your local PC. Each one of these feeds need to be checked every x amount of time. If you set it to 10 minutes, you better have uncapped. If you set it to 190 minutes, you're not going to get notified of updates very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use instant messaging, you only get a message sent to your computer when there are &lt;em&gt;actual changes&lt;/em&gt;. No wasting your bandwidth. And you're just opening and idling on a connection that would have been open anyway thanks to your other uses of the same platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you put this through XMPP, the advantages are immense. You don't just have to use your standard instant messaging client to handle your notifications. You can extend the XMPP protocol to allow any amount of semantics / metadata you like. You can therefore figure out rich displays and syndicate however much information you want (only post titles, summaries or entire posts). The extensibility factor is a major advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haha, this comes back to the semantic web; my favourite subject!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, integration with IRC is another thing to look at. Using IRC you can broadcast information to a vast number of people with a high degree of bandwidth efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First I have to get a server to run all of this on. This requires no ordinary hosting package. I need to be able to run daemons (permanently running background processes). I also need both Java and Python (like Google haha). Maybe I can come right with Python; will have to research Python-based XMPP libraries first. But I don't have the funding to set this up right now so I would really like to have some server space donated for this if possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please contact me if you would like to sponsor this project. This is world-revolutionary and has never been implemented nearly to this extent before (that I know of). We're not talking about African firsts, we're talking about world firsts. There are massive bragging rights and potentially even advertising opportunities involved, so don't let this one pass through your fingers. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I almost always have my cellphone with me; otherwise contact me using &lt;a href="http://charlvn.za.net/contact" rel="external"&gt;any of the possible methods&lt;/a&gt;. I am really excited and would love to share my ideas and plans!&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.charlvn.za.net/2007/04/muti-hooks-jabber-irc-bots.html'></link><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://blog.charlvn.za.net/feeds/posts/default/5250951597249232643'></link><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6950106/posts/default/5250951597249232643'></link><author><name>Charl van Niekerk</name></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6950106.post-6198613587301838141</id><published>2007-04-23T01:39:00.000Z</published><updated>2007-04-23T13:40:57.089Z</updated><title type='text'>Zoopy Embedded Videos</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I don't really like Zoopy's embedded video option at all. Why don't they link back to the original post on Zoopy by default from the embedded markup? Check out this example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=8,0,0,0" width="322" height="264" id="Zoom" bgcolor="#000000"&amp;gt; &amp;lt;param name="allowScriptAccess" value="sameDomain" /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.zoopy.com/Small_offsite.swf" /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;param name="FlashVars" value="stream=http://www.zoopy.com/video/1177256475.flv"/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;param name="bgcolor" value="#000000" /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;param name="loop" value="false" /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;embed src="http://www.zoopy.com/Small_offsite.swf" FlashVars="stream=http://www.zoopy.com/video/1177256475.flv" quality="high" bgcolor="#000000" width="322" height="264" name="Zoom" loop="false" allowScriptAccess="sameDomain" allowFullScreen="true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/object&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say I see this video on a blog post somewhere. Now I like the video so I want to post it to Muti, del.icio.us, reddit, digg it, or whatever. How am I supposed to know if that same video has already been posted from another blog or from the main site? I don't even know the title of the post so I can't even go and search. I just have to guess it, probably, but that's too much work if you ask me. Always post from the main site; that just helps to stop people posting the same thing over and over and wasting everybody's precious time. Now I don't know where the hell the original video was. There's no link back to the original thing.&lt;/p&gt;

Currently the site is on Wordpress, but that system thoroughly makes me sick. Therefore I am currently implementing my own custom blogging CMS to replace Wordpress. Building a CMS is actually much simpler than I thought. I don't know why people like to overcomplicate things so much. The only part that it turning out to be a bit of work is actually the admin back-end. However, I am going to really push this in the next couple of weeks before I start coding on my GSoC project, so I hope to have things live in the next short while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My commenting system and pingback system might still take a little longer, but I love coding so I'm sure I'll get around to that eventually. Naturally, I'll release all my source code under the &lt;a href="http://fidelis.za.net/" rel="external"&gt;Fidelis&lt;/a&gt; project but it will probably be GNU/GPL 2. This is negotiable however, if somebody can come up with a convincing argument why it should be otherwise. :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.charlvn.za.net/2007/04/custom-blogging-cms.html'></link><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://blog.charlvn.za.net/feeds/posts/default/7300882714382069120'></link><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6950106/posts/default/7300882714382069120'></link><author><name>Charl van Niekerk</name></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6950106.post-6622230840848131240</id><published>2007-04-22T08:59:00.000Z</published><updated>2007-04-22T21:00:08.391Z</updated><title type='text'>Joomla &amp; Semantic Web: Request for Feedback</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of really smart people out there so I'm not going to sit here in front of my computer on the southern tip of Africa and act like I know everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently I am busy refining my &lt;abbr title="Google Summer of Code"&gt;GSoc&lt;/abbr&gt; project before I start coding. If I'm going to be doing this, I want to do this properly. There's no point in spending dozens of hours of time doing something if it doesn't help anybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore I want to ask everybody, especially those that have some knowledge of web standards and the semantic web, to give me feedback on &lt;a href="http://blog.charlvn.za.net/2007/04/soc-proposal.html"&gt;my proposal&lt;/a&gt;. However, even if you're not the expert yourself and you have something to say, please do. No comments are stupid; there's value in absolutely everything. The more feedback I get, the better!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kind of questions I want to ask are the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;What are the technologies I should implement?&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;How should they be implemented? Which parts where?&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;How can they be implemented to best suit the users needs?&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Which products (user agents) should I focus on (in terms of testing, etc)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kind of arguments I would prefer to stay out of is "but don't you know by now RDF just sucks". As I've explained in a recent post to the Microformats discussion mailing list, I believe that web standards today are more focused on practical issues than theoretical ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago we use to argue about the "perfect" way to do things. Then we realised that everybody has their own definition of "perfect" and their own opinion of what the "perfect way to do things" would be. Then we realised that browser vendors are focused on their users far more than our ideals. Now we have HTML 5 and Microformats which are very much focused on &lt;strong&gt;making things work&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my side, I would really like to see the semantic web work and therefore I need to know what would make Joomla 1.5 a better product for users. If I manage to give the users added value at the end of the day, the Joomla Semantic Web Integration GSoC 2007 project will have been a great success in my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So therefore, if some integration with RDF will give users extra value because there's actual implementations out there, then I see it as a good thing. But let me know what &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; think! As I said previously, there are no such thing as a stupid comment. &lt;em&gt;Your&lt;/em&gt; opinion matters and I want to hear it.

She believes that eating healthy is better than taking antiretroviral drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months back, she got rather ill herself and during that time others in government quickly started pushing for antiretrovirals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A while back I picked up a copy of the &lt;cite&gt;Leadership in HIV/AIDS&lt;/cite&gt; magazine (issue 14 January 2007). On page 15 the heading says &lt;q&gt;Beetroot gets the boot&lt;/q&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally I think this is sending out the wrong message. When you are sick in any way, it is always a good thing to eat and live as healthy as possible in order to help your body recover (or at least fight the threat as much as possible) naturally. This is irrespective of a person taking artificial medicine or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all we need to remember that antiretroviral drugs are not a miracle cure. It usually doesn't cure HIV/AIDS, only fight against it giving a person a longer time to live. In some cases the person's health might even temporarily improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this would only help if the AIDS is HIV induced. If the AIDS have been caused by something else than a retrovirus, there's no point in taking antiretrovirals anyway. But seeing that in South Africa the most likely cause of AIDS is HIV, that's fair enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, one should be very realistic towards antiretrovirals. Firstly, it's not just one particular kind of medicine; there are many different type of medicine that have different effects. Some can be very toxic; they need to be handled with care. For example, when you handle them you need to wear gloves and a mask over your face so that you cannot accidentally inhale anything coming from them. And then you actually expect others to swallow that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also have a rather large list of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-retroviral#Adverse_effects" rel="external"&gt;adverse effects&lt;/a&gt; associated with their use. There have also been several reported cases of deaths related to the use of antiretrovirals. However, it's difficult to blame the antiretrovirals if the body of the victim is already half way down the drain thanks to AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know of one person that has taken antiretrovirals and got a lot better from them (yes, the visible effects of AIDS have actually been reversed in his case). I presume there are many other success stories out there as well. But antiretrovirals should still only be a last measure and not something you just want to throw around and act like it's perfectly safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grapevine has it that many of the nurses are actually selling antiretrovirals to patients that should be getting them for free. In other words, the nurses are pocketing the money and extorting people that are struggling to live. That is just plain sick. But I don't have proof of this yet so let's not jump to conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact is that the healthier the body itself, the better it will be able to fight against viruses such as retroviruses. If you decide to take them or not, eat as well as you can to give your body a fighting chance.

In a follow up on my &lt;a href="http://blog.charlvn.za.net/2007/04/creating-massive-adsl-wan-across-south.html"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; about creating a massive South African WAN using Telkom ADSL, I have been speaking to Outsider on Furion and he filled me in on the details about becoming a top-tier ADSL ISP provider such as IS and Verizon with Telkom. Apparently you need a massive ATM/IPConnect link to Telkom in order to be able to sell ADSL through Telkom's network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As explained in some of my previous posts, the way it works is like this. Your local loop runs between your house and an ADSL access multiplexer. If you use Telkom as your ISP, your traffic can go onto Telkom's IP backbone from there. However, if you use IS or Verizon, your traffic will be carried via Telkom's ATM network to one of their points (probably in Cape Town, Johannesburg, or some other major centre) and can go up onto the internet from there (or not).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, Telkom could be your only ADSL ISP, but then they opened it up so that others like IS and Verizon could also join. However, this does not help a lot because IS and Verizon still need to pay a lot of money in order for that ATM link to Telkom in order to be linked up with their customers. I am starting to wonder how this can be profitable at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if you don't have a lot of money to begin with, you can't open up a top-tier ISP. And therefore, this WAN of mine will be totally impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is indeed very sad, but I'm glad I posted about it so that I could learn more about how Telkom organises these things. Companies like Neotel will eventually also offer the local loop, but that is probably still pretty far off. So for now, my plans are shelved. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people actually thought that I was talking about using local-only ADSL in order to create the WAN. I don't know what on earth the point behind that will be, because local-only ADSL is still capped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, just to offer another clarification on my previous post, when I talk about "ISP" I mean a proper first-tier ISP (the kind that actually has its own country-wide network). Obviously I do not mean your regular Telkom/IS/Verizon resellers; the connection is between the client and Telkom/IS/Verizon, definitely not through the reseller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing that we discussed on IRC is the setup of a &lt;abbr title="Wireless User Group"&gt;WUG&lt;/abbr&gt;. The only problem is that the legals in South Africa is very shady on this area and it's not that easy to create a country-wide WUG. Of course you can link all the various WUGs together using ADSL, but then that will still be your bottleneck. What will that ADSL connection be? Will it even be uncapped? Even a 4 mbps uncapped connection (which AFAIK is not even yet available) would not suffice, I'm sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now don't get me wrong, wireless is great, but it's not the answer to everything. Nothing can replace a good landline network, and as long as that is being monopolised, we don't stand much of a chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well, I feel like downloading the odd terabyte or two... Who's going with me on a short holiday to Europe? :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.charlvn.za.net/2007/04/south-african-adsl-wan-follow-up.html'></link><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://blog.charlvn.za.net/feeds/posts/default/2382950633683447736'></link><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6950106/posts/default/2382950633683447736'></link><author><name>Charl van Niekerk</name></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6950106.post-4356391215715768886</id><published>2007-04-21T11:05:00.000Z</published><updated>2007-04-21T11:05:57.199Z</updated><title type='text'>Contact Forms</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Ok, so I really hate contact forms. I should at least explain why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people use a form the user must submit in order to send them mail because they don't want to publish their mail address. This is usually thanks to the large quantities of spam that are doing the rounds, but I have thoroughly given up with trying to protect myself from spam completely. I even receive spam on e-mail accounts I have never used and the addresses of whom are never published anywhere that I know of. Yeah, I give up. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google's spam filter does an amazing job. I receive a couple of hundred spam messages that are all filtered out correctly every day. I might get two or three a day that slip through, but those are easy enough to delete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what's wrong with a contact form?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say I see an interesting blog post. Often, I look up the person's e-mail address on the site and put it into my address book along with a note and only mail them much later. Their e-mail address is always there in my address book and I can synchronise that between any number of devices. I can easily send the person a mail by just typing their name into the "to" field in my mail application, even though I never sent them a mail before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After sending the person a mail, I have a copy of the mail in my sent items. Now I can go back to that mail any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the person utilises the semantic web and has an &lt;a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard" rel="external"&gt;hCard&lt;/a&gt; on their site, I can even import all their details directly into my address book. When all the fields for instant messaging details are standardised, adopted and implemented I can even add them to my instant messaging applications according to their / my / both of our preferences on protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's not the only problem. I often find that contact forms do not work. They are also prone to abuse by spammers (when any kind of information from the form is being injected into the mail header, that information needs to be thoroughly validated or else somebody could be abusing the form to send others spam).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come on people! This is 2007 - the semantic web is taking over. Information is king; elegant solutions need to be found against spam, not these hacks. Yes, in my opinion contact forms are just a hack.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.charlvn.za.net/2007/04/contact-forms.html'></link><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://blog.charlvn.za.net/feeds/posts/default/4356391215715768886'></link><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6950106/posts/default/4356391215715768886'></link><author><name>Charl van Niekerk</name></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6950106.post-3224567400577448535</id><published>2007-04-21T09:41:00.000Z</published><updated>2007-04-21T09:45:33.610Z</updated><title type='text'>Ajax Newsvine Feed</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Ok, so after yesterday's article about the &lt;a href="http://blog.charlvn.za.net/2007/04/ajax-delicious-json-post-feed.html"&gt;"Ajax" JSON del.icio.us feed&lt;/a&gt; you might be wondering how I did the "Ajax" Newsvine feed. That was actually much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After loading the source markup, I need to get things set up correctly in the DOM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function initNewsvine() {
  var h = document.createElement("h2");
  h.setAttribute("onclick", "loadNewsvine()");
  h.appendChild(document.createTextNode("Newsvine"));
  sidebar.insertBefore(h, blogger);
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the heading is "clicked" on the following method will take care of the loading process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function loadNewsvine() {
  var h = getSidebarHeader("Newsvine");
  h.setAttribute("onclick", "toggle(this)");
  toggle(h);
  
  var div = document.createElement("div");
  div.setAttribute("id", "newsvine_content");
  div.appendChild(getLoading());
  sidebar.insertBefore(div, h.nextSibling);
  
  var script = document.createElement("script");
  script.setAttribute("type", "text/javascript");
  script.setAttribute("src", "http://charlvn.newsvine.com/_feeds/jss/master?count=30&amp;amp;seeds");
  document.getElementsByTagName("HEAD")[0].appendChild(script);
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it. I needed to create that &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; element because after Newsvine's script loaded it will automatically populate that so I don't need to worry about anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the poor code quality but this is only for some inspiration and the record. This will be removed now from my script. I actually want to look at writing something similar for Muti now if nobody else already did. I don't even use Newsvine much since the bookmarklet to post new items is down very often and it's starting to work on my nerves.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.charlvn.za.net/2007/04/ajax-newsvine-feed.html'></link><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://blog.charlvn.za.net/feeds/posts/default/3224567400577448535'></link><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6950106/posts/default/3224567400577448535'></link><author><name>Charl van Niekerk</name></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6950106.post-8878752024056556029</id><published>2007-04-21T06:52:00.000Z</published><updated>2007-04-21T07:00:55.764Z</updated><title type='text'>Joomla Southern Africa</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;This is very exciting news to me, especially since Joomla is my mentoring organisation for the &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/soc/" rel="external"&gt;Google Summer of Code&lt;/a&gt; 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://joomla.org.za/" rel="external"&gt;Southern African Joomla&lt;/a&gt; community is finally getting off the ground.

&lt;p&gt;For quite some time now (at least in Internet terms) I have been displaying my latest &lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/charlvn" rel="external"&gt;del.icio.us bookmarks&lt;/a&gt; in my sidebar. This is actually really simple using the standard &lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/help/json/posts" rel="external"&gt;JSON post feed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, because performance is important to me and because I don't like wasting people's bandwidth, I don't just want to display the links by default (especially not since they need to be loaded from a different server and HTTP/1.1 cannot do its magic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore I implemented it the so-called "Ajax" way. I actually hate these buzzwords, but I guess that's what people call this these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is only applicable to user agents that support JavaScript and have it enabled for my site. First of all, take a look at my &lt;a href="http://blogger.charlvn.za.net/scripts/general.js" rel="external" type="application/javascript"&gt;general JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; (the server has been configured to send this as &lt;code&gt;application/x-javascript&lt;/code&gt; and not as &lt;code&gt;application/javascript&lt;/code&gt; but that's outside of my control because it's an IIS server).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you go and take a look at my source markup, you will find no mention of del.icio.us whatsoever. This is the proper way to do things, in my opinion. If the user agent doesn't use JavaScript, why should the markup be plagued with it? I like clean separation of content, presentation and behaviour. Since JavaScript is usually used for behaviour, I believe that should be kept separate. But maybe that's just me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now take a look at the &lt;code&gt;initDelicious&lt;/code&gt; method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function initDelicious() {
  var h = document.createElement("h2");
  h.setAttribute("onclick", "loadDelicious()");
  h.appendChild(document.createTextNode("Delicious"));
  sidebar.insertBefore(h, blogger);
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that &lt;var&gt;sidebar&lt;/var&gt; and &lt;var&gt;blogger&lt;/var&gt; are defined in global scope and has already been set to their correct values. (Take a look at the &lt;code&gt;initGlobals&lt;/code&gt; method for this.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two problems with the above. The first is that my event handler is poorly assigned. I could go and rework the script to do it properly (and maybe even get this to work in IE) but just lack the interest right now. The second problem is that I'm making us of the &lt;code&gt;onclick&lt;/code&gt; event. This obviously presents an accessibility problem. Some users that don't use a pointing device of some sorts (mouse, touch pad, touch screen, etc) might have a problem. This is actually a problem with my entire menu system, but at least when you disable JavaScript this issue is taken away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;onclick&lt;/code&gt; has anyway been somewhat poorly conceptualised and the name suggests it being applicable only to a very limited range of devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second method you will need is &lt;code&gt;loadDelicious&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function loadDelicious() {
  var h = getSidebarHeader("Delicious");
  h.setAttribute("onclick", "toggle(this)");
  toggle(h);
  sidebar.insertBefore(getLoading(), h.nextSibling);
  
  var script = document.createElement("script");
  script.setAttribute("type", "text/javascript");
  script.setAttribute("src", "http://del.icio.us/feeds/json/charlvn?count=10");
  document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(script);
  loadDeliciousList();
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gets a little complicated because it uses various other methods in the same script. The &lt;code&gt;toggle&lt;/code&gt; method is used to display or hide a particular section below a heading. The &lt;code&gt;getSideBar&lt;/code&gt; method just gets the right &lt;code&gt;h2&lt;/code&gt; element according to its content. The &lt;code&gt;getLoading&lt;/code&gt; method just gets a nice &lt;a href="http://www.ajaxload.info/" rel="external"&gt;"Ajax loading image"&lt;/a&gt;, all for the eye candy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I seriously need to investigate the accessibility of this further though, because I really worry about that in general with this script. Again, disable the JavaScript and you should be fine. I am making the assumption here that a user agent with JavaScript enabled will be the "typical" visual user but that is a really bad assumption to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that only when this method is executed after the user "clicked" on the right heading is the JSON script loaded from del.icio.us. Keeps things nice and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this is where the hacking comes in. I don't really know of a cleaner way to do this, but please let me know if you do. I need to know when their script is finished loading so that I can populate the DOM from the &lt;var&gt;Delicious&lt;/var&gt; object their script gives me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep executing the &lt;code&gt;loadDeliciousList&lt;/code&gt; method using a timer until I detect that the delicious script has been loaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function loadDeliciousList() {
  if (typeof Delicious == "object") {
    var h = getSidebarHeader("Delicious");
    sidebar.removeChild(h.nextSibling);
    var ul = document.createElement("ul");
    sidebar.insertBefore(ul, h.nextSibling);
    var li, a;
    for (var i = 0, post; post = Delicious.posts[i]; i++) {
      li = document.createElement("li");
      ul.appendChild(li);
      a = document.createElement("a");
      a.setAttribute("href", post.u);
      a.setAttribute("rel", "external");
      a.appendChild(document.createTextNode(post.d));
      li.appendChild(a);
    }
  } else {
    window.setTimeout(loadDeliciousList, 1000);
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as the &lt;var&gt;Delicious&lt;/var&gt; global has been set, the script is loaded and I can insert the data into my page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am really missing XML here but then I would have cross-domain issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you might laugh at a few things because this JavaScript is a quick hack I did sometime last year and admittedly it sucks big time. I probably could have done things much cleaner and better, but to be honest I just don't want to spend the time right now improving a script I am going to throw out anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just thought I should post about this in case anybody might be interested. Also, if I wasn't so utterly perfectionist and minimalist about my DOM I could have added a lot of stuff to make the job a whole lot easier for myself. Also, I bet &lt;a href="http://jquery.com/" rel="external"&gt;jQuery&lt;/a&gt; would have saved me a lot of time, but I just hate bloat and the script isn't without its limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feedback very welcome, but before you comment and flame, I already know this script is crap. Please do feel free to ask me any questions though you might have!!! :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.charlvn.za.net/2007/04/ajax-delicious-json-post-feed.html'></link><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://blog.charlvn.za.net/feeds/posts/default/7331902153774594049'></link><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6950106/posts/default/7331902153774594049'></link><author><name>Charl van Niekerk</name></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6950106.post-1599011817528488652</id><published>2007-04-20T02:50:00.000Z</published><updated>2007-04-20T15:09:34.882Z</updated><title type='text'>Geek Dinner / 27 Dinner on IRC</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I was wondering; the &lt;a href="http://www.geekdinner.org.za/" rel="external"&gt;Geek Dinner&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://27dinner.pbwiki.com/" rel="external"&gt;27 Dinner&lt;/a&gt; are such exciting events, do they have &lt;abbr title="Internet Relay Chat"&gt;IRC&lt;/abbr&gt; channels for some of us to lurk on between events?
