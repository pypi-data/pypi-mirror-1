Description: ==========
        openxmllib
        ==========
        
        openxmllib is a set of tools that deals with the new ECMA 376 office file
        formats known as OpenXML.
        
        http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-376.htm
        
        OpenXML format is actually used by Microsoft Office 2007. Apple iWork'08 and
        OpenOffice 2.2 have filters to use this format too.
        
        Features
        ==========
        
        Tested features
        ---------------
        
        * Extract words from a document for indexing purpose.
        * Get metadata from a document
        
        Planned features
        ----------------
        
        * Transform a document to HTML
        
        Public API
        ==========
        
        These examples say all::
        
        >>> import openxmllib
        >>> doc = openxmllib.openXmlDocument('office.docx')
        >>> # Raises a ValueError on not supported office files.
        >>> doc.mimeType
        'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document'
        >>> doc.coreProperties # Keys may depend on application
        {'title': u'blah...', u'creator': u'John Doe', ...}
        >>> doc.extendedProperties # Keys may depend on application
        {'Words': u'312', 'Application': u'Your favorite word processor', ...}
        >>> doc.customProperties # May return an empty mapping
        {'My property': u'My value', ...}
        >>> doc.allProperties # Merges core+extended+custom properties (see above)
        {...}
        >>> doc.indexableText(include_properties=False)
        u'all the words of that document body'
        >>> doc.indexableText(include_properties=True)
        u'all the words of that document body and all properties values'
        
        Note that if you're not running a Python application, you may get the indexable
        text from a document with the `openxmlinfo.py` console utility. Just type::
        
        $ openxmlinfo.py --help

        Status
        ======
        
        This software is in production quality, has been tested on Mac OSX, Linux and
        Windows with Python 2.4, Python 2.5, lxml 1.3.6 and lxml 2.2.
        
        It should work on other platforms, with Python 2.6, perhaps with
        other versions of lxml.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Using the usual setuptools command::
        
        $ [sudo] easy_install openxmllib
        
        Note that this will install the excellent `lxml` egg too if not already done.
        
        From now you can "import openxmllib" in your Python apps and use the
        "openxmlinfo.py" command line utility.
        
        Gotchas
        =======
        
        Be aware that most text data coming from the various openxmllib
        services might be us-ascii or Unicode. This is a side effect of lxml
        (bug or feature ?). It's up to your application to convert these texts
        to the appropriate charset.
        
        We do not actually handle exceptions due to malformed XML or various
        unexpected structures. You should handle the various (potential)
        problems in a try (...) except (...) block in your application.
        
        Developing and testing
        ======================
        
        You should grab openxmllib with your subversion client from its `repository at
        Google code <http://code.google.com/p/openxmllib/source/checkout>`_.
        
        Then::
        
        $ cd /where/you/installed/openxmllib
        $ python setup.py develop
        
        Note that testing does not require the installation::
        
        $ cd tests
        $ python runalltests.py

        Future features and bugfixes
        ============================
        
        Features
        ========
        
        API change
        ----------
        
        Change API of document constructor such the document source type should be
        explicite. Examples :
        
        >>> doc = openXmlDocument(url='http://some.site.tld/gossips.docx')
        >>> data = open('gossips.docx', 'rb').read()
        >>> doc = openXmlDocument(data=data, mime_type='application/xxx')
        >>> doc = openXmlDocument(filepath='/somewhere/gossips.docx')
        >>> handle = open('/somewhere/gossips.docx')
        >>> doc = openXmlDocument(stream=handle)
        
        Remove downloaded temporary file
        --------------------------------
        
        When data is coming from HTTP (...) URL, it's stored in a temporary file that's
        not deleted after processing.
        
        Support for standard mimetypes module
        -------------------------------------
        
        Add our mime types to standard Python module.
        
        Support for URLs
        ----------------
        
        >>> from openxmllib import openXmlDocument
        >>> doc = openXmlDocument('http://www.mydomain.com/mydoc.docx')
        
        Human readable plain text conversion
        ------------------------------------
        
        >>> from openxmllib import openXmlDocument
        >>> doc = openXmlDocument(...)
        >>> doc.textDocument(target_directory)
        
        (this may be not possible for spreadsheets)
        
        HTML conversions
        ----------------
        
        >>> from openxmllib import openXmlDocument
        >>> doc = openXmlDocument(...)
        >>> doc.htmlDocument(target_directory)
        
        This requires to find open source XSLT stylesheets.
        
        Document generation
        -------------------
        
        FIXME: more to say here
