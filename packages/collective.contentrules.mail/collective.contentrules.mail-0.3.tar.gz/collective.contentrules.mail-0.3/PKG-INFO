Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package provides an extended content rule "mail" action with many more
        variable substitutions available, including the name and email address of
        the content owner, making it possible to email the owner of a piece of
        content.
        
        It is also possible to provide new "replacers" by writing an interface with
        an associated adapter and registering a new `IMailModel` utility. The user
        is able to pick the replacer to use on the action edit form.

        * Added a note in the UI about how to use variables.
        [optilude]
        
        * The 'source' field is not required, but would throw an error if not filled

        adaptable to the replacer interface.
        [optilude]
        
        * Made the default replacer adapt any Dublin Core-capable content, avoiding

        * Made the default IMailModel implementation more re-usable.
