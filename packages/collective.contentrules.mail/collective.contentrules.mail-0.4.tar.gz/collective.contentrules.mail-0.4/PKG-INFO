Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package provides an extended content rule "mail" action with many more
        variable substitutions available, including the name and email address of
        the content owner, making it possible to email the owner of a piece of
        content.
        
        It is also possible to provide new "replacers" by writing an interface with
        an associated adapter and registering a new `IMailModel` utility. The user
        is able to pick the replacer to use on the action edit form.
        
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.4 - 2009-09-06
        ----------------
        
        * Avoid a site error if the mail cannot be sent, e.g. because the mail
        server is down.
        [optilude]
        
        * Avoid throwing an exception on encoded strings in the replacer.
        [optilude]
        
        * Caught workflow exception when trying to get state on object without any
        workflow.
        [tiazma]
        
        * Added cc and bcc fields to IMailAction enabling the use of these fields in
        mail messages
        [erico_andrei]
        
        * Added new variables to IMailReplacer so it is possible to send emails to
        users with other roles than owner on the object
        [erico_andrei]
        
        * Made sure Archetypes content implements IDublinCore (It's not the default
        behavior until AT 1.5.10)
        [erico_andrei]
        
        * Correct action mail fail on try to replace bcc or cc when it returns None [lucmult]
        
        0.3 - 2009/03/24
        ----------------
        
        * Added a note in the UI about how to use variables.
        [optilude]
        
        * The 'source' field is not required, but would throw an error if not filled
        in. This is now fixed.
        [optilude]
        
        0.2 - 2009/03/24
        ----------------
        
        * Made the executor fail gracefully if the content being acted upon is not
        adaptable to the replacer interface.
        [optilude]
        
        * Made the default replacer adapt any Dublin Core-capable content, avoiding
        an unnecessary dependency on Archetypes.
        [optilude]
        
        * Made the default IMailModel implementation more re-usable.
        [optildue]
        
        * Updated documentation and interface specifications.
        [optilude]
        
        * Fixes actions/configure.zcml in order to play nice with GenericSetup
