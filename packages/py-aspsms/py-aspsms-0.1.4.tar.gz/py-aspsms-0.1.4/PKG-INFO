Description: aspsms (www.aspsms.com) is a Swiss company that offers SMS gateway
        services for a fair price. Py-aspsms is a Python interface for this
        service. Currently, only basic operations are supported (e.g. sending
        a simple SMS or getting information about the remaining credit) but I
        am currently extending it. If you have specific neeeds (e.g. sending a
        ringtone or an operator logo) just put your request on the issue tracker
        or send me an e-mail.
