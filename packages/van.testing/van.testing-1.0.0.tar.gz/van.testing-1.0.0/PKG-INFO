        Layers
        ------
        
        Some basic layers useful for making test setups.
        
        >>> import os.path
        >>> from van.testing.layer import zcml_layer, null_layer
        
        A zcml layer which sets up and tears down a zcml test harness (but is much
        simpler than that provided with zope.app.functional):
        
        >>> class ZCMLLayer:
        ...     zcml = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'ftesting.zcml')
        >>> zcml_layer(ZCMLLayer)
        
        Some default layers are provided for use with zope.testing, a "null" layer that
        specifically does nothing. This is useful for layers which inherit from other
        layers but where you don't want setup/teardown functions run twice (is this a
        zope.testing bug?):
        
        >>> class ExampleNullLayer(ZCMLLayer):
        ...     pass
        >>> null_layer(ExampleNullLayer)
