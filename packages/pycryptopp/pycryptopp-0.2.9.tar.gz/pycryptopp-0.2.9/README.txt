development headers.  To build it run "./setup.py build".  To test it run
"./setup.py test".  To install it into your system run "./setup.py install".  To
create a binary package run "./setup.py bdist_egg".  There are more features of
setup.py -- see the documentation of setuptools [3] for details.

The documentation is in the docstrings.  From within a Python interpreter use
"help(pycryptopp)", "help(pycryptopp.cipher)", and "help(pycryptopp.cipher.aes)"
and so on.  From a command-line, use "pydoc pycryptopp", "pydoc

CONTACT

I intend to set up a mailing list, but until I do please post to the
cryptopp-users mailing list [4] with comments about this package.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Thanks to Wei Dai and the contributors to Crypto++, Andrew M. Kuchling for his
"pycrypto" library which inspired this one, and Brian Warner for help on Python
packaging questions and a million other things besides.
