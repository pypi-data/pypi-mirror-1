[thread_pool_size]
id = thread_pool_size
name = Thread pool size
description = The number of worker threads in the thread-pool. In general, this many threads will not be running concurrently as NT Completion Ports are used. See Microsoft KB article Q192800 for more details on Completion Port based thread-pools.

[log_original_path]
id = log_original_path
name = Log original path
description = If False, the IIS logs will include the 'encoded' version of the remote URL. If True, the original URL of the request will be written. There is a slight performance penalty associated with this operation, so it may be disabled if performance is a higher priority than human readable paths in the log. Note: IIS must be restarted before this option will take effect.

[vh_root]
id = vh_root
name = Virtual host root
description = The root folder on the Plone server which will be exposed via IIS. Assuming you only want to expose a Plone site rather than the entire Zope site, this should generally be set to Plone. Setting this to something other than the root of your Plone site will cause all URLs to go out.

[lh_root]
id = lh_root
name = Local host root
description = The local host root i.e., the leading IIS path specifier for requests to this host. Leading and trailing slashes may be omitted. If this is blank or /, the root of the IIS server will be used. For example, if this was Sales, your Plone site would be accessed via http://iis_server/Sales/

[host_headers]
id = host_headers
name = Host headers
description = A space (or comma) separated list of hostnames that this section applies to. If not specified, it applies to all hosts. The entries specified are matches against the Host: header as specified by the original request. This allows you to have 2 different domains hosting 2 different Plone sites from the same IIS instance. Host names are case insensitive, but otherwise must match exactly. This is particularly useful when your are using a version of IIS that does not support multiple sites. If you have already configured IIS itself to have multiple sites based on 'host' header matching, then you should not need to configure this setting in EEP - just specify the specific IIS site via the 'site' option - IIS will have already performed that filtering when redirecting to the appropriate IIS site. For more information see handling multiple sites and domains.

[lh_server]
id = lh_server
name = Local host server
description = The name of the local-host. If not specified, the host name as reported by IIS will be used. This value is generally only necessary when a load-balancing, Virtual IP or similar front end is used for IIS and the original 'host' header requested does not match the name of the IIS machine. This option only changes the URL sent to the remote machine, it does not affect if the section is processed - to limit sections to only specified hosts, see the requested_hosts option.

[site]
id = site
name = Site
description = The name or ID of the IIS web-site that this section applies to. If not specified, it applies to all web sites. This is handy is you want a single EEP instance to work with 2 different sites, each with different host configurations. The name can be specified as either the name as it appears in the IIS management console (for example, "Default Web Site"), or by its IIS site ID (for example, "1", "2", etc). For more information see handling multiple sites and domains.
