Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package has been done start during sprint@ploneconf2009. The goal is first
        to provide nighly load tests to Plone. The other goal is to be able to do the same
        on any other Plone project fast.
        
        Using buildbot and funkload together, allow you to have feedbacks about
        performance impact done by your last code modifications every day in mail or ttw.
        
        How to use it
        =============
        
        First the process:
        
        * Create a new funkbot project (projectname, vcs type, vcs address of the buildout)
        * Go inside, init the buildout (buildout init or python bootstrap.py)
        * launch the buildout will install buildbot and funkload
        * launch master and slave daemons
        * Connect your webbrowser to http://localhost:9080
        * Ask a force rebuild will launch the build of your project.
        
        Now the command line:
        
        * paster create -t funkbot plone4
        * virtualenv plone4
        * cd plone4
        * source bin/activate
        * easy_install zc.buildout
        * buildout
        * master start && mycomputer start
        * firefox http://localhost:9080
        
        Where things are
        ================
        
        The main things to understand is that you are creating a buildbot. So the first buildout doesn't build
        the project. It build the buildbot that will build the project (sic).
        
        TODO
        ====
        
        * add static for serving funkload reports ttw (in progress)
        * send mail at the end of tests with funkload reports inside
