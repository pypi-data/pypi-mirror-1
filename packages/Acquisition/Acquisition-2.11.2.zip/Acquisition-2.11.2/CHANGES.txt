Changelog
=========

2.11.2 (2010-02-25)
-------------------

- Fix the ``tp_name`` of the ImplicitAcquisitionWrapper and
  ExplicitAcquisitionWrapper to match their Python visible names and thus have
  a correct ``__name__``.

- Expand the ``tp_name`` of our extension types to hold the fully qualified
  name. This ensures classes have their ``__module__`` set correctly.
