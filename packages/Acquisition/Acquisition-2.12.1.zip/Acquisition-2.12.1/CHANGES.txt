Changelog
=========

2.12.1 - 2009-04-15
-------------------

- Update for iteration proxying: The proxy for `__iter__` must not rely on the
  object to have an `__iter__` itself, but also support fall-back iteration via
  `__getitem__` (this fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope2/+bug/360761).

2.12 - 2009-01-25
-----------------

- Release as separate package.
