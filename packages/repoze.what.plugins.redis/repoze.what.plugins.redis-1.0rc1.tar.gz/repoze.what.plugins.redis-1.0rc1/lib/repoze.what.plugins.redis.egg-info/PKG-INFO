Description: 
        ============================
        The repoze.what Redis plugin
        ============================
        
        This is an adapters plugin for `repoze.what <http://what.repoze.org/docs/1.x/>`_
        
        The Redis plugin makes *repoze.what* support sources defined in Redis key-value
        databases by providing one group adapter and one permission adapter.
        
        Redis
        =====
        
        `Redis <http://code.google.com/p/redis/>`_ is a key-value database. It is
        similar to memcached but the dataset is not volatile, and values can be strings,
        exactly like in memcached, but also lists and sets with atomic operations
        to push/pop elements.
        
        In order to be very fast but at the same time persistent the whole dataset
        is taken in memory and from time to time and/or when a number of changes
        to the dataset are performed it is written asynchronously on disk.
        
        The database name is numeric; the default database is **0**.
        
        *repoze.what.plugin.redis* uses database **1** for the group adapter and
        database **2** for the permission adapter.
        
        The database **0** could be used for any table related to users as the sessions.
        
        Building
        --------
        
        To compile the trunk version::
        
        $ git clone git://github.com/antirez/redis.git
        $ cd redis
        $ make
        
        To update::
        
        $ git pull && make clean && make
        
        To run the server::
        
        $ ./redis-server
        
        The Python library is in *./client-libraries/python/*
        
        *Note*: The client-libraries directory inside the Redis distribution is
        only a temp thing.
        
        Little issues
        -------------
        
        * If the client is disconnected after of some time of inactivity --it's
        configured to 300 seconds by default--, and it's called any command then
        it raises a *ConnectionError*. It should be rather managed from the Python driver:
        
        http://groups.google.com/group/redis-db/browse_thread/thread/2581396a6722d3f9
        
        * The data are synchronously saved. It could be modified the *_save* function
        (in the Redis adapter) for that it been asynchronously saved, or for that
        it been saved only when a number of changes to the dataset are performed.
        
        Use
        ===
        
        Typical usage:
        
        >>> import redis
        >>> from repoze.what.plugins.redis import adapters
        
        >>> group = adapters.RedisGroupAdapter(redis.Redis())
        >>> permission = adapters.RedisPermissionAdapter(redis.Redis())
