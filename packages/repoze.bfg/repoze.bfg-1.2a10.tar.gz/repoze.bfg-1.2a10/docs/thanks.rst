Author Thanks
=============

This book is dedicated to my grandmother, Dorothy Phillips.

Thanks to the following people for providing expertise, resources, and
software.  Without the help of these folks, neither this book nor the
software which it details would exist: Paul Everitt, Tres Seaver,
Malthe Borch, Carlos de la Guardia, Georg Brandl, Simon Oram of
Electrosoup, Ian Bicking of the Open Planning Project, Jim Fulton of
Zope Corporation, Tom Moroz of the Open Society Institute, and Todd
Koym of Environmental Health Sciences.

Special thanks to Guido van Rossum and Tim Peters for Python.

Special thanks also to Tricia for putting up with me.
