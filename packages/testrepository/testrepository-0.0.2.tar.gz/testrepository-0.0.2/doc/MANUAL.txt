Test Repository users manual
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Overview
~~~~~~~~

Test repository is a small application for tracking test results. Any test run
that can be represented as a subunit stream can be inserted into a repository.

Typical workflow is to have a repository into which test runs are inserted, and
then to query the repository to find out about issues that need addressing. For
instance, using the sample subunit stream included with Test repository::

  $ testr init
  $ testr load < doc/example-failing-subunit-stream
  $ testr todo
  1 Failure 1 Error
  # fix things
  $ testr load < doc/example-passing-subunit-stream
  $ testr todo

Most commands in testr have comprehensive online help, and the commands::
  $ testr help
  $ testr commands

Will be useful to explore the system.
