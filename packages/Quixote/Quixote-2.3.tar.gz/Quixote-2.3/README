Quixote
=======

Quixote is a framework for developing Web applications in Python.  
The target is web applications that are developed and maintained
by Python programmers.

Quixote requires Python 2.3 or greater to run.  For installation
instructions, see the doc/INSTALL.txt file.

Quixote includes PTL, the Python Template Language for producing 
HTML with Python code.  The use of PTL is not required in Quixote 
applications, but we recommend it.  Details about PTL are provided
in doc/PTL.txt.

If you're switching to a newer version of Quixote from an older
version, please refer to doc/upgrading.txt for explanations of any
backward-incompatible changes.
