Description: 
        A learning-by-testing program to learn quickly, mostly memorizing
        tasks like vocabulary. Quizdrill supports multiple choice, simple
        quiz as well as flashcard testing. Although still quite primitive
        Quizdrill asks questions which have been answered right more often
        then others more often to improve learning efficiency. Quizzes can
        be easily created by edition simple text files or automatically built
        from Infobox-style templates of Wikipedia dumps (or other MediaWikis
        and even Semantic MediaWikis).
