Future Plans
============

Program
-------
* Testing
    * new question types
        * image-tests (e.g. geography)
        * sound-tests (e.g. dictating to test spelling)
        * image/sound-mapping (e.g. little kid word learning)
    * additional learning support
        * (better) selection of next quiz for the learning strategy (at the
          moment we just check if right or wrong).
            * start with the SuperMemo v2[1] algorithm
              PROBLEM: how to score the answer (0-5), without making the
                user do this manually, which slows the testing down 
                considerably. Using the time needed to answer does not help as
                the user will get interrupted by other work, phone, ...
              IDEA: 0: wrong in multiple choice (mc); 1: right in mc
                2: right in simple quiz (sq) after peaking in mc
                3: wrong in sq with more than 1 try (or more than two hints); 
                4: wrong in sq with 1 try (or one hint)
                5: right at first try (3-5 don't seem to be that good).
              IDEA: Additionally use Levenshtein distance[2] or difflib to 
                determine typo or completely wrong (and could even show the 
                wrong letters in red).
            * when user gets new words first show him the list of the new words
              then train her with multiple choice then switch to simple quiz 
              (or flashcard if the user can't type very well) (possibly with 
              hints at first).
        * support learning strategies: e.g. Mnemonic[3] 
        * word said after correct answer on vocabulary tests
    * Test multiple quizzes
        * UI: one list with all quizzes, mod with add/open/close menu-items
            * but what should be done with bidirectional tests?
                * needs activation explicitly and then asks
        * switch them between relax-times (not snoozing) as switching topics
          is unnecessarily difficult (for humans).
    * Add hint system for simple quiz (and possibly flashcard).
        * show number of letters with underscores ("_").
        * add additional letters if more hints are requested.
    * More build/generating sources
        * verbiste[4]
        * wiktionary[5]
* improve UI
    * support system-tray (notify when breaks over)
    * accessibility support
    * switch treeview colons, when test direction changes
    * easy edit of quizfile (open-in-editor or edit directly + save)
    * logo/icon
* gconf-support
    * last/recent quiz
    * config-options
        * which ones ? => design Preferences-window
* fix Bugs ;-)
* translate in more languages

Documentation
-------------
* always need more ...

Quiz
----
* more, more, more, ... ;-) especially more built tests from wikipedia.
