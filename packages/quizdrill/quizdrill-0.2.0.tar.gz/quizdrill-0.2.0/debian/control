Description: learning-by-testing to excess program
 A learning-by-testing program to learn quickly, mostly memorizing 
 tasks like vocabulary. Quizdrill supports multiple choice, simple
 quiz as well as flashcard testing. Although still quite immature
 Quizdrill asks questions which have been answered right more often 
 then others less often to improve learning efficiency. Quizzes can 
 be easily created by edition simple text files or automatically built 
 from Infobox-style templates of Wikipedia dumps (or other MediaWikis 
 and even Semantic MediaWikis).
