<p>Our main quiz writer speaks German, so <a href='http://openfacts.berlios.de/index.phtml?title=Quizdrill/Quiz_schreiben' class='external' title="http://openfacts.berlios.de/index.phtml?title=Quizdrill/Quiz schreiben">that version</a> is getting more attention and a higher priority. It should be translated and extended here. Help is always welcome. 
<p>
Please don't hesitate to ask on <a href='http://developer.berlios.de/mail/?group_id=7994' class='external' title="http://developer.berlios.de/mail/?group id=7994">the mailing list</a>.

<p>
<a href='http://storm.prohosting.com/borco/programming/langdrill.html' class='external' title="http://storm.prohosting.com/borco/programming/langdrill.html">langdrill</a> drill files are very similar to quizdrill's. The only difference are the header lines. To convert a langdrill drill file, replace the [Application]-section with
<p>
!type: vocabulary<br/>
!language: &lt;value of &quot;directSenseName&quot;&gt;=&lt;value of &quot;reverseSenseName&quot;&gt;
<p>
and that is it. Note however, that quizdrill has a style-guideline for the quizfiles, which you might want to follow. However this can be done quickly and is not mandatory to be included to the quizdrill quizzes. So just send then to us rather than waiting into you are in the mood to fix it yourself ;-).
