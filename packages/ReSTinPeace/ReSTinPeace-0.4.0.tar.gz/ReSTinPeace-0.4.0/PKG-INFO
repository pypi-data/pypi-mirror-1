        RIP is a library aimed at simplifying the usage of ReStructured Text for
        publishing content on the web. As such, it operates under the following
        restrictions:
        
        * Only HTML output is produced.
        * Only produces output for input received, i.e. does not produce full document
        output.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Basic output rendering.

        * Extensible architecture for including more directives/roles.
