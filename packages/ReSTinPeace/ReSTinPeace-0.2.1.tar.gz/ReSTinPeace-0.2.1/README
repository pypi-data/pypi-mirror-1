RIP is a library aimed at simplifying the usage of ReStructured Text for
publishing content on the web. As such, it operates under the following
restrictions:

    * Only HTML output is produced.
    * Only produces output for input received, i.e. does not produce full document
      output.

FEATURES:

    * Basic output rendering.
    * Configurability for all sane options.
    * Command line runner interface.

TODO:

    * Extensible architecture for including more directives/roles.

    * URL Prefixing for resources.
    * Code Highlighting with Pygments.
    * LaTeX rendering of mathematical formulae.
