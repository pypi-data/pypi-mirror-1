        bbfreeze - create standalone executables from python scripts
        ======================================================================
        
        
        Overview
        ======================================================================
        bbfreeze creates standalone executables from python scripts. It's
        similar in purpose to the well known py2exe_ for windows, py2app_ for
        OS X, PyInstaller_ and cx_Freeze_ (in fact it includes some bits from
        cx_Freeze and PyInstaller. And it uses the modulegraph_ package,
        which is also used by py2app).
        
        It has the following features:
        
        easy installation
        bbfreeze can be installed with setuptools' easy_install command.
        
        binary dependency tracking
        bbfreeze will track binary dependencies and will include DLLs and
        shared libraries needed by a frozen program.
        
        multiple script freezing
        bbfreeze can freeze multiple scripts at once.
        
        python interpreter included
        bbfreeze will create an extra executable named 'py', which might be
        used like the python executable itself.
        
        bbfreeze works on windows and UNIX-like operating systems. It
        currently does not work on OS X. bbfreeze has been tested with python
        2.4 and 2.5. bbfreeze will not work with python versions prior to 2.3
        as it uses the zipimport feature introduced with python 2.3.
