What is it?
-----------

pyBox2D is a 2D physics library for your games and simulation. It's based on the
Box2D library, written in C++. It supports several shape types (circle, polygon,
thin line segments), quite a few joint types (revolute, prismatic, etc.), and 
even controllers (buoyancy, gravity, etc.). 

Getting Started
---------------

For building instructions, see INSTALL or the wiki on the homepage. Once
installed, check out the testbed demos to see what pyBox2D can do (located in 
testbed/ ). Then read the manual located on the Box2D wiki, here:

   http://www.box2d.org/wiki/index.php?title=Python_Manual

A possibly outdated local copy is included in this distribution in docs/ .

For more information on some caveats and key differences between the C++ version
of Box2D, please see:

   http://www.box2d.org/wiki/index.php?title=Box2D_with_Python

On the wiki, you will also find more useful things of varying quality.
