Description: 
        dbsh -- an interactive shell for DB back-end.
        
        Every known DB has its own shell for SQL operations.
        The dbshell (dbsh) provides unique, interactive, programmable environment
        and simple shell to connect and manipulate your favorite DB contexts.
        It supports naturally a syntax of DB you use to, for example, while you connect to
        MySQL dbsh supports full syntax of MySQL, but when you connect to ORACLE it supports
        ORALCE SQL and commands.
        
        It is based on two components:
        - interactive python IPython, http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/About.
        - SQLAlchemy, http://www.sqlalchemy.org
        
        It uses SQLAlchemy ORB tool as an SQL layer to perform interactive operations against given DB-backend.
        Therefore it provides common shell for ANY DB back-end in uniform fashion.
        All SQL operations supported by given DB back-end naturally supported by dbsh.
