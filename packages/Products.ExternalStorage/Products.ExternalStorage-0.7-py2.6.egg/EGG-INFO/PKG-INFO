Description: About
        
        ExternalStorage is a storage for Archetypes storing the fields contents
        outside the ZODB. So it works in a fashion like ExternalFile or similar
        products.
        
        Note
        ExternalStorage 0.6 *requires* an Archetypes version *after* 1.3.3-final.
        Older Archetypes versions have critical bugs and won't work with this
        version of ExternalStorage.
        
        Usage
        
        Simply define one of your field's storages in a schema as ExternalStorage.
        (see ExternalExample in examples/).
        
        Example
        
        Copy examples/ExternalExample into your Products dir.
        
        Defining Custom Path Policy
        
        You can provide your own path policy, just write a method on your
        class called 'getExternalPath' (or anything else that you specified
        at 'path_method' when intantiating the storage).
        
        Some common uses include:
        
        1) Instance relative path to current portal (default):
        path = portal_url.getRelativeContentURL(instance)
        
        2) Instance absolute path, including portal name and all above
        path = '/'.join(instance.getPhysicalPath())
        
        3) Flat Instance UID
        path = instance(UID())
        
        4) Sorted by Portal Type
        path = instance.getTypeInfo().getId() + '/' + instance.getId()
        
        By default, files are stored accordingly policy (1). If class has
        multiple fields, then (1) will be a folder and the files are stored
        inside it, following the field names.
        
        Remember to provide additional code to support multiple fields
        when providing your custom path policy.
        
        Archive
        
        In some previous versions there was some sort of archive support.
        This was implemented as a copy of the old content in some special
        folder.
        
        It's removed from the current version, but will be readded later.
