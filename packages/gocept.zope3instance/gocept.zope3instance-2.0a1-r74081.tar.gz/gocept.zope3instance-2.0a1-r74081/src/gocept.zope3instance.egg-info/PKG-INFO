Description: Recipe for createing a Zope 3 instance
        ======================================
        
        This recipe creates a Zope instance that has been extended by a
        collection of eggs.
        
        A Zope installation or checkout is not required by this recipe. You should
        make your application depend on zope.app.
        
        The recipe takes the following options:
        
        database
        The name of a section defining a zconfig option that has a zodb
        section.
        
        admin-user
        The user name for the manager user.
        
        admin-password
        The password for the manager user.
        
        eggs
        One or more requirements for distributions to be included.
        
        
        To do
        -----
        
        - Need tests
        
        - Hopefully, for Zope 3.4, we'll be able to make the instance-creation
        process more modular, which will allow a cleaner implementation for
        this recipe.
        
        - Support for multiple storages
        
        - Support for more configuration options.
