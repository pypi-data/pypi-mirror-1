Glasnägel is a set of goodies (shortcuts, decorators, etc.) for the Glashammer_
web framework. Some code from this package may be later included in the
framework itself. Think of Glasnägel as a playground for development of various
little features. Please feel free to contibute. Forks and patches are welcome.
