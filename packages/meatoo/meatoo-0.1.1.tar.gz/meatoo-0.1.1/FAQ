Q: Why does the -t option rarely show anything?

A: Freshmeat makes their database available twice a day, so
depending on where you are in relation to GMT, it may show
few results. Your best bet is to use -l to see the latest
20 packages.

The upcoming version of the meatoo server has a plugin system
that allows people to write plugins for other services like
CPAN, The Cheese Shop (Python Package Index) etc., so the
database will be updated much more frequently.
