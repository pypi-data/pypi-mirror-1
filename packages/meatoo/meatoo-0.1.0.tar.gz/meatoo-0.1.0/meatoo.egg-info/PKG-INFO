        Summary
        -------
        `Meatoo <http://meatoo.gentooexperimental.org/>`_ is a website which shows which packages in Gentoo Linux need a version bump. The database queries Freshmeat, The Cheese Shop and other sources for its information. The meatoo command-line client
        uses an XML-RPC interface.
        
        
        Usage Examples::
        
        $ meatoo -m python
        List all packages owned by the Python herd needing a version bump.
        
        $ meatoo -l
        List latest 20 packages needing a version bump.
        
        $ meatoo -c dev-python/cherrypy
        Check if an exact category/package needs a version bump.
