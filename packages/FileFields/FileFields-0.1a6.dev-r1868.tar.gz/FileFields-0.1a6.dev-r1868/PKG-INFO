Description: Right now this package provides 2 widgets, FileField and ImageField.
        These widgets support file uploading with server side caching. That means that
        if some other field in the form fails validation, the user wont have to upload
        the file again. Instead they get the information of the file they included or a
        thumbnail of the image if it's an ImageField. An option to remove the file from
        the form is given too.
        
        The ImageField has a thumbnail preview and allows size validation and automatic
        resizing when dimensions get past certain values (this isn't enabled by
        default).
        
        If Lightbox is installed (optional), the full size images will be displayed
        with it (non popup image viewer).
        Also an animation removing the file attached to the form will be shown if
        Scriptculous is installed (optional).
        The server side caching is done using the TemporaryFile class from the official
        Python tempfile module. It's a secure way to store files on a platform
        independent way. The files are cleared when they are not used anymore.
        
        The widgets need a controller that will be the file server for the download
        links and images previews. You can import the controllers from
        file_fields.controllers (PicServer and FileServer) and specify the url on the
        widget constructors (file_server_url, image_server_url)
        
        The easiest and recommended way is enabling the extension your dev.cfg,
        prod.cfg or app.cfg adding:
        
        file_field_server.on = True
