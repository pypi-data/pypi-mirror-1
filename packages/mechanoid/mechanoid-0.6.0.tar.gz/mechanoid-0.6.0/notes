mechanoid 0.6.0
(Package is a Python distribution file of OS-neutral Python code)

mechanoid is a programmatic browser written in Python. It is intended as
an engine which will do things like log in as SourceForge project admin
and do a Quick Release or send and receive web mail.  mechanoid is a
fork of John J. Lee's mechanize.

WARNING: Robot.txt processing removed.

== Release Notes ==

Mechanoid is being developed as the back-end for unusual browsers such
as voice-text browsers for the handicapped and meta-page browsers for
Web programmers.  Because mechanoid is intended for use as a browser and
not a web-bot, the handling of robots.txt files has been removed. YOU
SHOULD NO LONGER USE MECHANOID AS A BOT.
