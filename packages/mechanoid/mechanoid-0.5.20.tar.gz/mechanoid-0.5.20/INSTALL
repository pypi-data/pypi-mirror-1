mechanoid Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install the package, run the following command:

						python setup.py install

Alternatively, just copy the whole mechanoid directory into your Python
path (eg. unix: /usr/local/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages, Windows:
C:\PythonXY, or C:\PythonXY\Lib\site-packages).  That's all that
setup.py does.  Only copy the mechanoid directory that's inside the
distributed tarball / zip archive, not the entire mechanoid-x.x.x
directory!
