Description: Summary
        =======
        
        This product make possible the customization of the Plone "*Add new...*" menu, commonly filled
        from the Plone available content types.
        
        This is designed for avoiding useless content types but, at the same time, help UI experience of not
        experienced users.
        
        You can use this to add new non-standard stuff to the menu (like Javascript links). See below.
        
        Idea behind this
        ================
        
        The case is related to developed content types that gets added to Plone only for *usability* enhancements.
        
        One example: have you ever used Plone4ArtistsVideo, or collective.flowplayer?
        In those products users that want to add new video to a site must use the "*Add new...*" menu and select
        the *File* content.
        
        So the editor (that is *never* a developer in real life... you must accept it) must know that when he add
        a new file, it magically became a video... This is not so simple to understand; also is impossible to
        understand it without a training or by past experience.
        Will not be better if the user can read "*Add new video*" in the menu instead?
        
        Right now the best usability choice is to add a new content type to the menu, or develop a new helper portlet
        that show some links like "*add a new video here*".
        
        In the first case, just copy/paste the original used content if enough (copy/paste the *File* content type and
        rename it in something like "Video").
        But you know... we don't really need those new content types.
        
        In the second case all is ok, but all that Plone users know is to look at the right menu to search for addable
        types, not to look in a menu and *also* in another place.
        
        So:
        
        * user know that for adding new content types, they must use the "*Add new...*"
        * users often ignores the magic behind Plone (like the File that became a Video)
        * developer don't like to add new silly content types only to help editors.
        
        The problem above is related to the not-customizable state of the "Add new..." menu: the editor and the
        developer will be both happy if a new, fake entry could be added to this menu.
        Going back to the video example:
        
        * the classic *File* entry (that point to *http://myhost/mysite/createObject?type_name=File*)
        * a new "Video" entry (again pointing to *http://myhost/mysite/createObject?type_name=File*)
        
        This products is designed only for this or similar usability issues.
        
        How to use
        ==========
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Simply add the egg to your buildout, and re-run it. Remember to add also the ZCML overrides.
        
        ::
        
        [instance]
        ...
        eggs =
        ...
        redturtle.custommenu.factories
        ...
        
        zcml =
        ...
        redturtle.custommenu.factories
        redturtle.custommenu.factories-overrides
        ...
        
        After this, install the new product in Plone.
        
        Uninstallation
        --------------
        
        You can *reinstall* the products safely without lose any customization data.
        If you *uninstall* it, all customization will be removed from your Plone site, leaving no garbage
        behind.
        
        Customize the menu
        ------------------
        
        In your "Add new..." menu you'll find a new "*Customize menu...*" entry. This will lead you to a
        customization form where you can manage local menu changes of the current context.
        
        .. figure:: http://keul.it/images/plone/redturtle.customizemenu.factories1.png

        The used *context* is always the *container* where you can find the context, or the context itself if it's
        a container.
        
        for every new entry you can/must fill this informations:
        
        `id`
        Enter here a string to be used to add an HTML id attribute to the new element. You can not provide
        it, but if you use an already existing ids, the new one will override the old.
        In this way you can *replace* one of the native (or inherited) menu entry with a new ones.
        `name`
        Required.
        Provide the string to be used for displaying the new element.
        `description`
        The description is used to provide a tooltips hovering the element.
        `icon`
        A TALES expression that can be used to give an icon to the new element (very common).
        `condition`
        A TALES condition expression. If not provided, the new element is added to the menu. In provided
        it is evaluated as True or False, so the element is displayed or not.
        `URL`
        Required.
        A TALES expression used to render the HREF attribute on the link in the element. You have total freedom
        here: you can also render a string as "*javascript:...*" to provide some Javascript features.
        
        Also you can inherit the customization done in the site root everywhere in the site, adding this to all
        other customizations. You can also locally block the inherit of root customization but you can also make
        new menu elements defined in the root available only in the root itself.
        
        Also, you can five a right *id* to new entries not only to override menu element from Plone normal
        behaviour, but also for change a customization done in the site root.

        TALES expressions
        -----------------
        
        In the TALES expression above, you can use those variables:
        
        `context`
        The current context, as Plone normal meaning
        `container`
        The container of the current context, or the context itself if the context is a container or you

        * localization
        * browser tests
        * javascript features for managing entries
        * code needs refactoring
        * tests on Plone 4
