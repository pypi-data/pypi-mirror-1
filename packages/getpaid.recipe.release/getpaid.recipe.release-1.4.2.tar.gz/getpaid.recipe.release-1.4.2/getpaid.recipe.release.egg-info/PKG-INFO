        Detailed Documentation
        **********************
        
        Tested with
        ===========
        
        A buildout using plone 3.1
        
        Required options
        ================
        
        Make sure to add unzip = true into your [buildout] part, so that you don't have problems with packages being zip safe.
        
        Supported options
        =================
        
        The recipe supports the following option:
        
        addpackages=
        
        You can choose the "extra" packages you want to use with the "addpackages" option. The names listed correspond to the names of the packages. So you could do addpackages=getpaid.discount
        
        Available packages:
        
        * getpaid.authorizedotnet
        * getpaid.clickandbuy
        * getpaid.formgen
        * getpaid.googlecheckout
        * getpaid.ogone
        * getpaid.payflowpro
        * getpaid.paymentech
        * getpaid.paypal
        * getpaid.pxpay
        * getpaid.flatrateshipping
        * getpaid.ups
        * getpaid.discount
        * getpaid.report
        * getpaid.warehouse
        * getpaid.SalesforcePloneFormGenAdapter
        
        What to add in your buildout
        ============================
        
        We are assuming you have your own buildout created.
        
        >>> write('buildout.cfg',
        ... """
        ... [buildout]
        ... parts =
        ...     yourownparts
        ...     getpaid
        ...
        ... unzip = true
        ...
        ... [getpaid]
        ... recipe = getpaid.recipe.release
        ...
        ... addpackages=
        ...     getpaid.paymentech
        ...     getpaid.discount
        ...
        ...
        ... [instance]
        ... eggs =
        ...     yourowneggs
        ...     ${getpaid:eggs}
        ...
        ... [zope2]
        ... (...)
        ... fake-zope-eggs = true
        ... skip-fake-eggs =
        ... additional-fake-eggs = ZODB3
        ... """)
        
        
        In resume:
        
        - you add the getpaid part
        - in the getpaid part, you can choose the "extra" packages you want to use with the "addpackages" option
        - by default, the following packages are installed: ore.viewlet, getpaid.core, Products.PloneGetPaid, getpaid.wizard, getpaid.nullpayment, five.intid, hurry.workflow, simplejson, yoma.batching, zc.resourcelibrary and zc.table
        - then you will have to run bin/buildout, start your instance and quickinstall PloneGetPaid
