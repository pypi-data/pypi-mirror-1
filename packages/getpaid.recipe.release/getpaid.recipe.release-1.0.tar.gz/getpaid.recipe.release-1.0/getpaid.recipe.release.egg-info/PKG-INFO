        Detailed Documentation
        **********************
        
        Tested with
        ===========
        
        A buildout using plone 3.1
        
        Required options
        ================
        
        You need to have the following find-links so that the getpaid recipe can find the packages.
        
        find-links=
        
        - http://getpaid.googlecode.com/files/hurry.workflow-0.9.1-getpaid.tar.gz
        - http://getpaid.googlecode.com/files/yoma.batching-0.2.1-getpaid.tar.gz
        - http://getpaid.googlecode.com/files/zc.resourcelibrary-0.5-getpaid.tar.gz
        - http://getpaid.googlecode.com/files/zc.table-0.5.1-getpaid.tar.gz
        - http://download.zope.org/distribution/ssl-for-setuptools-1.10
        
        Make sure also to add unzip = true into your [buildout] part, so that you don't have problems with packages being zip safe.
        
        Supported options
        =================
        
        The recipe supports the following option:
        
        addpackages=
        
        You can choose the "extra" packages you want to use with the "addpackages" option. The names listed correspond to the names of the packages. So you could do addpackages=getpaid.discount
        
        
        What to add in your buildout
        ============================
        
        We are assuming you have your own buildout created.
        
        >>> write('buildout.cfg',
        ... """
        ... [buildout]
        ... parts =
        ...     yourownparts
        ...     getpaid
        ...
        ... unzip = true
        ...
        ... [getpaid]
        ... recipe = getpaid.recipe.release
        ...
        ... addpackages=
        ...     getpaid.paymentech
        ...     getpaid.discount
        ...
        ... find-links=
        ...     http://getpaid.googlecode.com/files/hurry.workflow-0.9.1-getpaid.tar.gz
        ...     http://getpaid.googlecode.com/files/yoma.batching-0.2.1-getpaid.tar.gz
        ...     http://getpaid.googlecode.com/files/zc.resourcelibrary-0.5-getpaid.tar.gz
        ...     http://getpaid.googlecode.com/files/zc.table-0.5.1-getpaid.tar.gz
        ...     http://download.zope.org/distribution/ssl-for-setuptools-1.10
        ...
        ... [instance]
        ... eggs =
        ...     yourowneggs
        ...     ${getpaid:eggs}
        ...
        ... [zope2]
        ... (...)
        ... fake-zope-eggs = true
        ... skip-fake-eggs =
        ... additional-fake-eggs = ZODB3
        ... """)
        
        
        In resume:
        
        - you add the getpaid part
        - in the getpaid part, you can choose the "extra" packages you want to use with the "addpackages" option
        - by default, the following packages are installed: ore.viewlet, getpaid.core, Products.PloneGetPaid, getpaid.wizard, getpaid.nullpayment, five.intid, hurry.workflow, simplejson, yoma.batching, zc.resourcelibrary and zc.table
        - then you will have to run bin/buildout, start your instance and quickinstall PloneGetPaid
