    <h2>About Public Domain Works</h2>

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>The Public Domain Works DB is an <a href="http://opendefinition.org/">open</a> registry of artistic works that are in the public domain. It is focused on sound recordings (and their underlying compositions) because a term extension for sound recordings is currently being considered in Europe.</p>
		<p>In the future it will will expand to cover all types of cultural works which are covered by copyright. The DB is a joint project of <a href="http://www.freeculture.org.uk/">Free Culture UK</a> and the <a href="http://www.okfn.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation</a> and the <a href="http://www.openrightsgroup.org/">Open Rights Group</a>.</p>

    <h3>Acknowledgements and Credits</h3>
    <p>We are extremely grateful to Philip Harper for donating his composer data to the Public Domain and for allowing us to use his book and author data from the <a href="http://www.kingkong.demon.co.uk/ngcoba/ngcoba.htm">New General Catalog of Books and Authors</a> (there is also a <a href="http://www.authorandbookinfo.com/">dedicated search interface</a>). We are also very grateful to the BBC archives for giving their CAIRNS and GRAMS catalogue data to us.
