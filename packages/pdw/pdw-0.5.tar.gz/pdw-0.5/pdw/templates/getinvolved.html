    <h2>Get Involved Public Domain Works</h2>

    <p>The Public Domain Works project is community based and developed by volunteer and we need <strong>your</strong> help to make it better. There's lot of stuff you could do so there should be something for everyone. For example, we need help with:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Development of the public domain works database and web application.</li>
      <li>Finding data and processing data from other sources for use in the database (as opposed to entry by hand)</li>
      <li>Keeping this website and the wiki up to date</li>
      <li>Publicizing the registry so that people know it exists and know how they can use it</li>
    </ol>

    <p>To get involved join up to the project mailing list: <a href="http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/pd-discuss">http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/pd-discuss</a>
