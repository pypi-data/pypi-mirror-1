Description: The PDW (Public Domain Works) package is the code which runs the Public Domain
        Works DB, an open registry of artistic works that are in the public domain:
        
        <http://www.publicdomainworks.net/>
        
        Though the project itself is focused on recording public domain works the code
        and database schema provided by the PDW package is (intentionally) generic and
        can be used to hold metadata on any kind of cultural material that fits into a
        basic FRBR-like Work-Item-Person schema (see model/frbr.py for more details.)
        
        The package also contains a variety of additional material such as:
        
        * Tools for cleaning up and normalized data
        * Scripts to import data from a wide variety of sources (MARC, Open Library
        JSON, NGCOBA)
        * Code for doing statistical analysis of the database
