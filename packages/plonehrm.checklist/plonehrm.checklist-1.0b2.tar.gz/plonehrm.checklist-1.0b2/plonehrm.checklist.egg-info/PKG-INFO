Description: Checklists for Plone HRM
        ========================
        
        With this package you can add checklists to an Employee.  There you
        can keep track of things that need doing, like getting a copy of their
        passport for your administration.
        
        
        1.0 beta 2 (2 September 2008)
        -----------------------------
        
        - Added README.txt.  [maurits]
        
        
        1.0 beta 1 (13 December 2007)
        -----------------------------
        
        - Made new checklist tool view to allow easy adding of new checklist
        items. To enable this, the browser view was extended and configured
        to also work in the checklisttool context.  [joris]
        
        - Corrected an error in addManagerItem. The item argument was missing.
        [joris]
        
        - Attached the contenttype to the EmployeeModuleWorkflow.  [reinout]
        
        - Added new methods and fields for manager checklists.  Also show
        these in the templates and rewrite the browser view to get rid of
        POST popup windows when using the browsers back button.  [joris]
        
        - Added bare-bones worklocation viewlet.  [reinout
        
        - Extended the tests to check the tool's behaviour. Also added methods
        for adding items to both the checklist CT and the tool. The tool's
        addItem() method can also add items to all existing items.
        [reinout]
        
        - Added a tool for storing the default checklist items.  [reinout]
        
        - Joris improved the UI on friday (for the "homepage"). Today I added
        a better widget to the normal edit form (though that ought only to
        be used when fixing mistakes made by clicking checkboxes on the
        homepage).  [reinout]
        
        - Added an empty propertysheet through genericsetup (for later
        customisation in a customisation product). Aaaaaand... added this
        changelog.  [reinout]
