	* skins/checklistmodule/checklisttool_view.pt: Made new checklist tool
	view to allow easy adding of new checklist items. To enable this, the
	browser view was extended and configured to also work in the 
	checklisttool context.

	* content/checklist.py: Corrected an error in addManagerItem. The item
	argument was missing.

	* A lot of files: Added new methods and fields for manager checklists.
	Also show these in the templates and rewrite the browser view to get
	rid of POST popup windows when using the browsers back button.

	* doc/overview.txt: Extended the tests to check the tool's
	behaviour. Also added methods for adding items to both the
	checklist CT and the tool. The tool's addItem() method can also
	add items to all existing items.

	* ChecklistTool.py: Added a tool for storing the default checklist
	items.

	* Joris improved the UI on friday (for the "homepage"). Today I
	added a better widget to the normal edit form (though that ought
	only to be used when fixing mistakes made by clicking checkboxes
	on the homepage).

	* profiles/default/propertiestool.xml: Added an empty
	propertysheet through genericsetup (for later customisation in a
	customisation product). Aaaaaand... added this changelog.
