History of plonehrm.checklist
=============================


1.0.7 (2009-06-03)
------------------

- When adding checklist items to all current lists, only search in the
  parent of the tool, which might not be the root of the site.
  [maurits]


1.0.6 (2009-06-03)
------------------

- Use the normal main_template instead of the prefs_main_template for
  the checklist tool view.  [maurits]


1.0.5 (2009-06-03)
------------------

- The ChecklistTool is no longer a unique object, which means you can
  add this tool for example inside a WorkLocation (from the ZMI or
  with some custom python code) so you can have checklists specific
  for this WorkLocation.  [maurits]


1.0.4 (2009-06-02)
------------------

- Removed the setting of the viewlets in the plonehrm_properties to
  the setuphandlers in Products.plonehrm, where we only set the order
  once.  [maurits+markvl]


1.0.3 (2009-05-29)
------------------

- Added id "checklist", to be able to change the layout for this
  viewlet in sites.  [mirella]


1.0.2 (2009-05-26)
------------------

- When deleting an item, we delete from the allItems and the
  checkItems fields.  [maurits+vincent]

- Added two methods to the checklist class. The first one, findItems,
  searches items in the check list. The second one, deleteItem,
  deletes a specific item from the list. Those two methods are needed
  by plonehrm.absence, in order to manage call to sick
  employees. [vincent]

- Removed .mo files from locales.  This means those translations will
  not be visible in the old Plone 3.0.  [maurits]


1.0.1 (2009-04-16)
------------------

- Use collective.autopermission to register permissions.
  [maurits]

- Set end-of-line style as native and set svn:ignores.  [maurits]


1.0 (2008-10-02)
----------------

- Using group icon for control panel.  [maurits]


1.0 beta 2 (2 September 2008)
-----------------------------

- Added README.txt.  [maurits]


1.0 beta 1 (13 December 2007)
-----------------------------

- Made new checklist tool view to allow easy adding of new checklist
  items. To enable this, the browser view was extended and configured
  to also work in the checklisttool context.  [joris]

- Corrected an error in addManagerItem. The item argument was missing.
  [joris]

- Attached the contenttype to the EmployeeModuleWorkflow.  [reinout]

- Added new methods and fields for manager checklists.  Also show
  these in the templates and rewrite the browser view to get rid of
  POST popup windows when using the browsers back button.  [joris]

- Added bare-bones worklocation viewlet.  [reinout

- Extended the tests to check the tool's behaviour. Also added methods
  for adding items to both the checklist CT and the tool. The tool's
  addItem() method can also add items to all existing items.
  [reinout]

- Added a tool for storing the default checklist items.  [reinout]

- Joris improved the UI on friday (for the "homepage"). Today I added
  a better widget to the normal edit form (though that ought only to
  be used when fixing mistakes made by clicking checkboxes on the
  homepage).  [reinout]

- Added an empty propertysheet through genericsetup (for later
  customisation in a customisation product). Aaaaaand... added this
  changelog.  [reinout]
