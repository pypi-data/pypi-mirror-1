Description: A library that can be used to add OpenID support to Django applications.
        The library integrates with Django's built in authentication system, so
        most applications require minimal changes to support OpenID llogin. The
        library also includes the following features:
        * Basic user details are transferred from the OpenID server via the
        simple Registration extension.
        * can be configured to use a fixed OpenID server URL, for use in SSO.
        * supports the launchpad.net teams extension to get team membership
        info.
