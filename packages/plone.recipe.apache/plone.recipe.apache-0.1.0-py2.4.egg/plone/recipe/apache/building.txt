Building
********

Supported options
=================

The recipe supports the following options:

url
    URL for an archive containing the Squid sources. Either **url** or
    **svn** has to be specified.

svn
    URL for a subversion repository containing Aapache sources. Either **url**
    or **svn** has to be specified.

modules
    Here you you can specify the extra modules that you want apache to be compiled with. Each module goes in
    one line. The module name will be appended to the configure statement with "--enable-<module>".


Example usage
=============

We'll start by creating a buildout that uses the recipe::

    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... parts = apachebuild
    ...
    ... [apachebuild]
    ... recipe = plone.recipe.apache:build
    ... url = http://mir2.ovh.net/ftp.apache.org/dist/httpd/httpd-2.2.8.tar.gz
    ... """ )

Running the buildout gives us::

    >>> print system(buildout)    
	Installing apachebuild.
    apachebuild: Downloading apache tarball.
    apachebuild: Compiling Apache
    ...
