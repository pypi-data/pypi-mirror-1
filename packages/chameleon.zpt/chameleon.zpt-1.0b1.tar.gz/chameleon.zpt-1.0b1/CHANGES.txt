1.0b1 (released 10/14/2008)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Tags are now omitted if a "tal:content" expression evaluates to
  ``None``. This behavior differs from the reference implementation,
  but does away with the need for a similar "tal:condition"
  attribute. [malthe]

1.0a2 (released 10/2/2008)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add a specialized TemplateLoader. [wichert]

- Fixed an incompatibility where non-boolean values would be returned
  as a skip node value. [malthe]

1.0a1 (released 9/24/2008)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- First release.
