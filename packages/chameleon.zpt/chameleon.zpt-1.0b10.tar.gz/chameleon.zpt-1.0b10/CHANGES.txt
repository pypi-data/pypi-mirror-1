Changelog
=========

1.0b10 (released 22/02/2009)
----------------------------

- Expressions inside variable substitutions are now escaped by
  default, unless the result is an object that has a ``__html__``
  method. [malthe]

- When filling a macro slot, replace the entire element, rather than
  filling its contents. [malthe]

1.0b9 (released 29/01/2009)
---------------------------

- Do not depend on component configuration; instead, fall back to a
  default "registry", modelled as a simple Python dictionary. [malthe]

- Depend on ``utility`` and ``adapter`` directives from
  ``repoze.zcml`` rather than using "stock" ``utility`` and
  ``adapter`` directives from ``zope.component``.  This prevents
  ``chameleon.zpt`` from requiring ``zope.security`` (and thus
  ``zope.location``, ``zope.publisher``, and
  ``zope.traversing``). [chrism]

1.0b8 (released 12/18/2008)
---------------------------

- Added support for recursive expression translators. [malthe]

1.0b7 (released 12/17/2008)
---------------------------

- Right-strip escape character from string-expressions (the semicolon
  ';' character). [malthe]

1.0b6 (released 12/03/2008)
---------------------------

- Added a ``interpolation`` meta attribute to control $-interpolation
  of expressions.  This defaults to ``true`` for
  chameleon.zpt. [seletz]

1.0b5 (released 11/29/2008)
---------------------------

- Removed unused imports, thanks to PyFlakes. [hannosch]

- Updated handling of static attributes. [malthe]

1.0b4 (released 11/19/2008)
---------------------------

- Allow empty expressions; for string-expressions, this means an
  empty string, rather than no expression. [malthe]

- Fixed string escape issue. [malthe]

- Fixed issue where translation pragma would be reset if a
  non-matching pragma was found. [malthe]

- Fixed bug that would parse global defines incorrectly. [malthe]

- TAL- and METAL-elements now subclass the XHTML-element class; this
  allows mixed usage of TAL and METAL. [malthe]

- `validate`-method is no longer formally required; errors are
  expected to be raised by the `translate`-method. [malthe]

- Formalized character escape requirement; this allows compatibility
  with ZPT with regards to semi-colon escapes in attribute
  declarations. [malthe]

- Allow chained pragmas. [malthe]

1.0b3 (released 11/12/2008)
---------------------------

- Added default element to parser class. [malthe]

1.0b2 (released 10/28/2008)
---------------------------

- Fixed missing attribute. [malthe]

1.0b1 (released 10/14/2008)
---------------------------

- Tags are now omitted if a "tal:content" expression evaluates to
  ``None``. This behavior differs from the reference implementation,
  but does away with the need for a similar "tal:condition"
  attribute. [malthe]

1.0a2 (released 10/2/2008)
---------------------------

- Add a specialized TemplateLoader. [wichert]

- Fixed an incompatibility where non-boolean values would be returned
  as a skip node value. [malthe]

1.0a1 (released 9/24/2008)
---------------------------

- First release.
