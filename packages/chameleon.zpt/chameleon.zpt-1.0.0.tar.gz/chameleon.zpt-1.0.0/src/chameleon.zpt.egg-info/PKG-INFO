Description: Overview
        ========
        
        This package provides a fast Zope Page Template implementation based
        on the Chameleon template compiler. It's largely compatible with
        ``zope.pagetemplate``.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Load the package component configuration file (configure.zcml).
        
        Performance
        -----------
        
        Casual benchmarks pegs it 16x more performant than the reference
        implementations for Zope TAL and Genshi (using Python-expressions).
        
        Compiler notes
        --------------
        
        The compiler is largely compatible with the reference
        implementation. The TAL implementation is based on the 1.4 language
        specification.
        
        Some notable changes:
        
        1. Tuple unpacking is allowed when defining variables::
        
        tal:define="(a, b, c) [1, 2, 3]"
        
        2. Generators are allowed in tal:repeat statements. Note that the
        repeat variable is not available in this case::
        
        tal:repeat="i <some generator>"
        
        3. Attribute-access to dictionary entries is allowed in
        Python-expressions, e.g.
        
        dictionary.key
        
        can be used instead of ``dictionary['key']``.
        
        4. The default expression type is Python.
        
        5. Genshi expression interpolation syntax is supported outside tags
        and inside static attributes, e.g.::
        
        <span class="hello-${'world'}">
        Hello, ${'world'}!
        </span>

        Development
        -----------
        
        If you want to use the code directly from trunk (recommended only for
        development and testing usage), provide ``chameleon.zpt==dev`` as your
        dependency.
        
        The code is maintained in a subversion repository::
        
        svn://svn.repoze.org/svn/chameleon.zpt

        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.0.0 (released 06/07/2009)
        ----------------------------
        
        - Insert an empty string in place for ``None`` with ``tal:content``
        (LP #379769).
        
        - Include changelog in long description. [hannosch]
        
        1.0b17 (released 20/05/2009)
        ----------------------------
        
        - Fixed whitespace issue. [malthe]
        
        - Update to latest Chameleon. [malthe]
        
        1.0b16 (released 22/04/2009)
        ----------------------------
        
        - Raise syntax error during validation if ``metal:use-macro`` is used
        together with ``metal:define-macro``. [malthe]
        
        - Add support for ``metal:extend-macro``. [sidnei, malthe]
        
        1.0b15 (released 17/04/2009)
        ----------------------------
        
        - Pass all keyword arguments to template superclass constructor. [malthe]
        
        - Define ``macros`` as a transient symbol; this fixes an issue where
        the ``render_macro`` method would not honor a ``macros`` parameter
        that was passed in. [malthe]
        
        1.0b14 (released 08/04/2009)
        ----------------------------
        
        - Set ``template`` and ``macros`` symbols only if not explicitly
        passed to the template. [malthe]
        
        - Reverted to have ``template`` being the currently-being-executed
        template, and have a ``macros`` which refers to the macros from the
        source template instance. To refer to macros in the current template
        ``macros.<<name>>`` should be used. [sidnei]
        
        1.0b13 (released 01/04/2009)
        ----------------------------
        
        - Added built-in name ``template``, which refers to the template
        instance. This symbol is introduced to make it possible to refer to
        macros within the current template
        (e.g. ``template.macros.<name>``). [malthe]
        
        1.0b12 (released 31/03/2009)
        ----------------------------
        
        - Updated language adapter to work with 'structure' meta attribute.
        
        - Providing dynamic attributes on a TAL-element should fail. See LP
        #340078. [malthe]
        
        1.0b11 (released 05/03/2009)
        ----------------------------
        
        - Fixed bug where whitespace would prevent matching. [malthe]
        
        - Added parser option to disable interpolation escaping. [malthe]
        
        - Enable DEBUG_MODE while running the tests. Some tests expect it to
        be enabled. [sidnei]
        
        1.0b10 (released 22/02/2009)
        ----------------------------
        
        - Expressions inside variable substitutions are now escaped by
        default, unless the result is an object that has a ``__html__``
        method. [malthe]
        
        - When filling a macro slot, replace the entire element, rather than
        filling its contents. [malthe]
        
        1.0b9 (released 29/01/2009)
        ---------------------------
        
        - Do not depend on component configuration; instead, fall back to a
        default "registry", modelled as a simple Python dictionary. [malthe]
        
        - Depend on ``utility`` and ``adapter`` directives from
        ``repoze.zcml`` rather than using "stock" ``utility`` and
        ``adapter`` directives from ``zope.component``.  This prevents
        ``chameleon.zpt`` from requiring ``zope.security`` (and thus
        ``zope.location``, ``zope.publisher``, and
        ``zope.traversing``). [chrism]
        
        1.0b8 (released 12/18/2008)
        ---------------------------
        
        - Added support for recursive expression translators. [malthe]
        
        1.0b7 (released 12/17/2008)
        ---------------------------
        
        - Right-strip escape character from string-expressions (the semicolon
        ';' character). [malthe]
        
        1.0b6 (released 12/03/2008)
        ---------------------------
        
        - Added a ``interpolation`` meta attribute to control $-interpolation
        of expressions.  This defaults to ``true`` for
        chameleon.zpt. [seletz]
        
        1.0b5 (released 11/29/2008)
        ---------------------------
        
        - Removed unused imports, thanks to PyFlakes. [hannosch]
        
        - Updated handling of static attributes. [malthe]
        
        1.0b4 (released 11/19/2008)
        ---------------------------
        
        - Allow empty expressions; for string-expressions, this means an
        empty string, rather than no expression. [malthe]
        
        - Fixed string escape issue. [malthe]
        
        - Fixed issue where translation pragma would be reset if a
        non-matching pragma was found. [malthe]
        
        - Fixed bug that would parse global defines incorrectly. [malthe]
        
        - TAL- and METAL-elements now subclass the XHTML-element class; this
        allows mixed usage of TAL and METAL. [malthe]
        
        - `validate`-method is no longer formally required; errors are
        expected to be raised by the `translate`-method. [malthe]
        
        - Formalized character escape requirement; this allows compatibility
        with ZPT with regards to semi-colon escapes in attribute
        declarations. [malthe]
        
        - Allow chained pragmas. [malthe]
        
        1.0b3 (released 11/12/2008)
        ---------------------------
        
        - Added default element to parser class. [malthe]
        
        1.0b2 (released 10/28/2008)
        ---------------------------
        
        - Fixed missing attribute. [malthe]
        
        1.0b1 (released 10/14/2008)
        ---------------------------
        
        - Tags are now omitted if a "tal:content" expression evaluates to
        ``None``. This behavior differs from the reference implementation,
        but does away with the need for a similar "tal:condition"
        attribute. [malthe]
        
        1.0a2 (released 10/2/2008)
        ---------------------------
        
        - Add a specialized TemplateLoader. [wichert]
        
        - Fixed an incompatibility where non-boolean values would be returned
        as a skip node value. [malthe]
        
        1.0a1 (released 9/24/2008)
        ---------------------------
        
        - First release.
