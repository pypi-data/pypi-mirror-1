    A Graph is a temporary representation of a graph before it is inserted

    ``name`` - the internal name of the graph
    ``graph`` - an RDFLib Graph, parsed on-demand (may raise an exception when
                it is accessed for the first time)
    ``serialized`` - serialized form of the ``graph`` attribute    
    ``uri`` - the URI for the named graph
    ``version`` - The version of the graph indicates how many times it has been
                  committed since it was created. Initial version is 1.
    ``ttl`` - The time in seconds after 1970 when the graph should be removed.
    
    The ``graph``-attribute parses the content of the ``serialized``-attribute 
    to get the actual triples. If the ``graph`` is modified, the data is updated
    accordingly. An externally modified graph must use the commit()-method to
    update the ``serialized``-attribute.
