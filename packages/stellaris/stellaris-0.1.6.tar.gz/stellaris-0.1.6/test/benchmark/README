Query Engine Benchmark
======================

This directory contains a small test case which can be used to benchmark
the performance of Icecore's internal query engine and compare it to an
external query engine such as SPARQLer (http://sparql.org).

Provided is a sample RDF/XML datafile 'benchmark.rdf' which contains a
graph with attributes directly attached to the root node plus some
subgraphs containing more metadata.

A corresponding SPARQL query, contained in 'benchmark.rq', is used
to query all the information from the RDF graph given in 'benchmark.rdf'.

The driver script, 'benchmark.pl', runs the benchmark. It takes two arguments:

  benchmark.pl <rdfserver:port> <sparqlerserver:port>

which specify the hostname and port number for an internal (Icecore) and
external (SPARQLer) RDF service. The script will perform the following steps:

 1) upload the RDF graph given in 'benchmark.rdf' multiple times under
    different context names into the internal RDF service
 2) execute the query from 'benchmark.rq' using the internal query engine
 3) execute the query from 'benchmark.rq' using the external query engine

Query execution times are printed to stdout.
Query results are stored in XML files. Their contents should be equivalent.
