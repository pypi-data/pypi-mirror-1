Changelog
=========

0.2 - (2009-08-03)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The JSON-output of a query is now a tuple of estimated number of
  matches and the result set. [malthe]

- Fixed issue where global registry would not be properly
  configured. [malthe]

- Handle JPEG-files without a XMP application segment (these are
  indexed with a trival metadata tree). [malthe]

- Use XMP instead of IPCT/EXIF; this sheds the dependency on the
  Hachoir library. [malthe]

- Added XMP extraction capabilities for JPEG-files. [malthe]

- Updated Xapian library versions in buildout configuration. [malthe]

0.1 - (2008-10-03)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Remove print statements. [seletz]

- Added tests for directory watch/observer.  Fixed a bug where the observer would
  emit absolute paths causing xapian to index absolute paths. [seletz]

- Hook watcher in.  The configured ``static`` directory is now watched.  Changes
  are now added to the Xapian queue. [seletz]

- Created a directory observer thing which will allow us later to atomatically
  wahtch a directory and issue Xapian operations. [seletz]

- Hooked in ``modify`` and ``remove`` views. [seletz]

- Changed query parser -- it now just uses the passed-in query string.  Also
  added ability to limit/batch query results. [seletz]

- Configured Xapian indexer.  This has to be done separately from the BFG
  components, because the Xapian indexer runs in its own thread and thus uses
  the global component registry. [seletz]

- Hooked up ``add`` view. [seletz]

- Implemented ``query`` view. [seletz]

- Fixed ``routes``setup wrt. permissions. [seletz]

- Changed svn layout. [seletz]

- Added buildout. [seletz]
