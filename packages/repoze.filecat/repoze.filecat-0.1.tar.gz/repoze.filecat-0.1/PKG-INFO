Description: Filecat
        =======
        
        This is a WSGI application written for the ``repoze.bfg`` framework
        which catalogs files in a Xapian database and provides a RESTful
        interface to dispatch jobs and perform queries.
        
        The application is configured with a ``path`` parameter which points
        to a pool of files (a directory structure) and a ``host`` parameter
        which provides a URL at which a webserver is configured to serve the
        directory.
        
        Components
        ----------
        
        The main server thread starts up a Xapian connection and listens for
        requests:
        
        All queries are performed using the following HTTP API::
        
        method  path                           description
        ----------------------------------------------------------
        POST    /purge                        Clear index
        POST    /add                          Add file to index
        
        @path   Relative filename
        
        POST    /update                       Reindex file
        
        @path   Relative filename
        
        POST    /remove                       Remove file from index
        
        @path   Relative filename
        
        GET     /query                        Perform query
        
        Parameters are passed as-is
        to the Xapian query engine.
        
        
        Query results
        -------------
        
        Queries return JSON structures with tuples of dicts on the following
        form:
        
        @url       The URL where this file can be downloaded
        @mimetype  MIME-type of the file
        @metadata  Dict-like structure with mimetype-specific metadata*
        
        *) The Hachoir Python package is used to provide this metadata for
        image and video files.

        CHANGELOG
        =========
        
        Head
        ~~~~~
        
        0.1 - (2008-10-03)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Remove print statements [seletz]
        
        - Added tests for directory watch/observer.  Fixed a bug where the observer would
        emit absolute paths causing xapian to index absolute paths [seletz]
        
        - Hook watcher in.  The configured ``static`` directory is now watched.  Changes
        are now added to the Xapian queue [seletz]
        
        - Created a directory observer thing which will allow us later to atomatically
        wahtch a directory and issue Xapian operations [seletz]
        
        - Hooked in ``modify`` and ``remove`` views. [seletz]
        
        - Changed query parser -- it now just uses the passed-in query string.  Also
        added ability to limit/batch query results. [seletz]
        
        - Configured Xapian indexer.  This has to be done separately from the BFG
        components, because the Xapian indexer runs in its own thread and thus uses
        the global component registry. [seletz]
        
        - Hooked up ``add`` view. [seletz]
        
        - Implemented ``query`` view. [seletz]
        
        - Fixed ``routes``setup wrt. permissions. [seletz]
        
        - Changed svn layout [seletz]
        
        - Added buildout [selez]
