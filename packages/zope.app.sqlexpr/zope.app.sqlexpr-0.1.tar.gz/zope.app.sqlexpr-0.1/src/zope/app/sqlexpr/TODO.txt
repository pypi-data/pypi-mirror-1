To Do List

  - Implement more advanced tests; boy it took me more time to write the tests
    than writing the code.

  - Check whether there is a better way of getting the connection name or the
    database information. The hard-coded variable names 'sql_conn', 'rdb', and
    'dsn' disturb me a bit.
