Description: Installation
        ============
        
        This package allows you to install Zine and its dependencies in a sandbox with
        buildout, then serve it with any WSGI server while using the Paste facilities
        for WSGI stack configuration.
        
        Install Zine:
        -------------
        Download and extract the zinebuildout archive from PyPI,
        (or clone it with: hg clone https://cody.gorfou.fr/hg/zinebuildout ).
        You don't need to easy_install it.
        Then run: ::
        
        $ python bootstrap.py
        $ ./bin/buildout
        
        Configure Zine:
        ---------------
        Edit "deploy.ini" to adapt ``instance_folder``, ``host`` and ``port`` to
        your needs. You don't need to change anything if you just want to try it on
        your local host.
        
        Start Zine:
        -----------
        In foreground: ::
        
        $ ./bin/paster serve deploy.ini
        
        Or in background: ::
        
        $ ./bin/paster serve --daemon deploy.ini
