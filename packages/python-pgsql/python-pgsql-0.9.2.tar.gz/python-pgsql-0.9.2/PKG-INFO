Description: 
        This is a set of Python bindings for PostgreSQL derived from
        the PyGreSQL 3.8.1 sources. The main changes from the PyGreSQL
        module are:
        
        * support for bind parameters, alleviating the need for extensive, expensive and vulnerable quoting of user-supplied data
        * support for server side cursors for looping through large query results without loading up the entire result set in the client's memory
        * returned values are translated to Python objects in the C layer, resulting in some speed improvement
        * DB API 2.0 compliance, with some extensions
