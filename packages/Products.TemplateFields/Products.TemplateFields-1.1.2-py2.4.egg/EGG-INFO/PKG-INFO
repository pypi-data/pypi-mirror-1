Description: This product provides two Archetype fields that store and render
        templates.  There's the DTMLField for DTML templates and the
        ZPTField for ZPT templates.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        1. Install as usual in your Products directory.
        
        2. Add this line to your custom Archetype to import the fields::
        
        from Products.TemplateFields import DTMLField, ZPTField
        
        3. In your schema, add DTMLFields and ZPTFields like this::
        
        BaseSchema + Schema(( ...
        DTMLField('oneField'),
        ZPTField('anotherField'),
        ...
        ))
