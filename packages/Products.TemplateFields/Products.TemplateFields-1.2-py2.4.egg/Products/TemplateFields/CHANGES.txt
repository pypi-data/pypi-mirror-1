Changelog
=========

1.2
---

* Add a configurable option to swallow errors generated while rendering a
  template field. These errors were problematic since they break catalog
  indexing of the object, resulting in site errors.

1.1.3
-----

* Make sure to use a page template with acquisition context when
  validating fields. Without this context variables such as
  ``context`` and ``here`` were not available.
  [wichert]

* Cleanup REST syntax in the documentation and add a changelog.
