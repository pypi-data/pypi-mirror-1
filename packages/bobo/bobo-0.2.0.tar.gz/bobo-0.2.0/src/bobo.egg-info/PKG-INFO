Description: 
        Bobo is a light-weight framework for creating WSGI web applications.
        
        It's goal is to be easy to use and remember. You don't have to be a genius.
        
        It addresses 2 problems:
        
        - Mapping URLs to objects
        
        - Calling objects to generate HTTP responses
        
        Bobo doesn't have a templateing language, a database integration layer,
        or a number of other features that are better provided by WSGI
        middle-ware or application-specific libraries.
        
        Bobo builds on other frameworks, most notably WSGI and WebOb.
