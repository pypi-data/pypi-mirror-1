Welcome to Hedge!
-----------------

Hedge is the 

  Hybrid'n'Easy Discontinuous Galerkin Environment.

It is a "hybrid" because it is written in both Python and C++. The Python
part takes care of high-level control, while the low-level C++ part takes
care of crunching the numbers, resulting in a fast code that is extremely
easy to use.

See the build instructions at [1] to learn how to compile hedge.
