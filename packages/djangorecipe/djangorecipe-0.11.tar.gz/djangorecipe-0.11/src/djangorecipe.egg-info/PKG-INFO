Description: Description
        ===========
        
        This buildout recipe can be used to create a setup for Django. It will
        automatically download Django and install it in the buildout's
        sandbox. You can use either a release version of Django or a
        subversion checkout (by using `trunk` instead of a version number.
        
        You can see an example of how to use the recipe below::
        
        [buildout]
        parts = satchmo django
        eggs = ipython
        
        [satchmo]
        recipe = gocept.download
        url = http://www.satchmoproject.com/snapshots/satchmo-0.6.tar.gz
        md5sum = 659a4845c1c731be5cfe29bfcc5d14b1
        
        [django]
        recipe = djangorecipe
        version = trunk
        settings = development
        eggs = ${buildout:eggs}
        pythonpath =
        ${satchmo:location}
        project = dummyshop
        
        
        Supported options
        =================
        
        The recipe supports the following options.
        
        project
        This option sets the name for your project. The recipe will create a
        basic structure if the project is not already there.
        
        projectegg
        Use this instead of the project option when you want to use an egg
        as the project. This disables the generation of the project
        structure.
        
        version
        The version argument can accept a few different types of
        arguments. You can specify `trunk`. In this case it will do a
        checkout of the Django trunk. Another option is to specify a release
        number like `0.96.2`. This will download the release
        tarball. Finally you can specify a full svn url (including the
        revision number). An example of this would be
        `http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/branches/newforms-admin@7833`.
        
        settings
        You can set the name of the settings file which is to be used with
        this option. This is useful if you want to have a different
        production setup from your development setup. It defaults to
        `development`.
        
        download-cache
        Set this to a folder somewhere on you system to speed up
        installation. The recipe will use this folder as a cache for a
        downloaded version of Django.
        
        pythonpath
        All paths specified here will be used to extend the default Python
        path for the `bin/*` scripts.
        
        control-script
        The name of the script created in the bin folder. This script is the
        equivalent of the `manage.py` Django normally creates. By default it
        uses the name of the section (the part between the `[ ]`).
        
        wsgi
        An extra script is generated in the bin folder When this is set to
        `true`. This can be used with mod_wsgi to deploy the project. The
        name of the script is `control-script.wsgi`.
        
        test
        If you want a script in the bin folder to run all the tests for a
        specific set of apps this is the option you would use. Set this to
        the list of app labels which you want to be tested.
        
        testrunner
        This is the name of the testrunner which will be created. It
        defaults to `test`.
        
        All following options only have effect when the project specified by
        the project option has not been created already.
        
        urlconf
        You can set this to a specific url conf. It will use project.urls by
        default.
        
        secret
        The secret to use for the `settings.py`, it generates a random
        string by default.
        
        
        Another example
        ===============
        
        The next example shows you how to use some more of the options::
        
        [buildout]
        parts = django extras
        eggs =
        hashlib
        
        [extras]
        recipe = iw.recipe.subversion
        urls =
        http://django-command-extensions.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ django-command-extensions
        http://django-mptt.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ django-mptt
        
        [django]
        recipe = djangorecipe
        version = trunk
        settings = development
        project = exampleproject
        wsgi = true
        eggs =
        ${buildout:eggs}
        test =
        someapp
        anotherapp
        
        
        Example configuration for mod_wsgi
        ==================================
        
        If you want to deploy a project using mod_wsgi you could use this
        example as a starting point::
        
        <Directory /path/to/buildout>
        Order deny,allow
        Allow from all
        </Directory>
        <VirtualHost 1.2.3.4:80>
        ServerName      my.rocking.server
        CustomLog       /var/log/apache2/my.rocking.server/access.log combined
        ErrorLog        /var/log/apache2/my.rocking.server/error.log
        WSGIScriptAlias / /path/to/buildout/bin/django.wsgi
        </VirtualHost>
        
        
        Changes
        =======
        
        0.11
        ----
        
        - Another go at fixing the updating problem (#250811) by making sure
        the update method is always called. It would not be called in the
        previous version since the recipe wrote a random secret (if it
        wasn't specified) to the options for use with a template. Buildout
        saw this as a change in options and therefore always decided to
        un-install & install.
        
        - When both projectegg and wsgi=True are specified, the generated wsgi
        file did not have the correct settings file in it. This has been
        fixed with a patch from Dan Fairs.
        
        - The recipe now has logging. All print statements have been replaced
        and a few extra logging calls have been added. This makes the recipe
        more informative about long running tasks. Thanks erny for the patch
        from issue #260628.
        
        0.10
        ----
        
        - The recipe no longer expects the top level directory name in a
        release tarball to be consistent with the version number. This fixes
        issue #260097. Thanks to erny for reporting this issue and
        suggesting a solution.
        
        - Revision pinns for the svn checkout now stay pinned when re-running
        the buildout. This fixes issue #250811. Thanks to Remco for
        reporting this.
        
        - Added an option to specify an egg to use as the project. This
        disables the code which creates the basic project structure. Thanks
        to Dan Fairs for the patch from issue #252647.
        
        0.9.1
        -----
        
        - Fixed the previous release which was broken due to a missing
        manifest file
        
        0.9
        ---
        
        - The settings option is fixed so that it supports arbitrary depth
        settings paths (example; `conf.customer.development`).
        
        - The version argument now excepts a full svn url as well. You can use
        this to get a branch or fix any url to a specific revision with the
        standard svn @ syntax
        
        - The wsgi script is no longer made executable and readable only by
        the user who ran buildout. This avoids problems with deployment.
