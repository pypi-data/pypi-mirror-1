Changes
=======

0.9.1
-----

- Fixed the previous release which was broken due to a missing
  manifest file

0.9
---

- The settings option is fixed so that it supports arbitrary depth
  settings paths (example; `conf.customer.development`).

- The version argument now excepts a full svn url as well. You can use
  this to get a branch or fix any url to a specific revision with the
  standard svn @ syntax

- The wsgi script is no longer made executable and readable only by
  the user who ran buildout. This avoids problems with deployment.
