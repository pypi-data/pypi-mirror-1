Changes
=======

0.10
----

- The recipe no longer expects the top level directory name in a
  release tarball to be consistent with the version number. This fixes
  issue #260097. Thanks to erny for reporting this issue and
  suggesting a solution.

- Revision pinns for the svn checkout now stay pinned when re-running
  the buildout. This fixes issue #250811. Thanks to Remco for
  reporting this.

- Added an option to specify an egg to use as the project. This
  disables the code which creates the basic project structure. Thanks
  to Dan Fairs for the patch from issue #252647.

0.9.1
-----

- Fixed the previous release which was broken due to a missing
  manifest file

0.9
---

- The settings option is fixed so that it supports arbitrary depth
  settings paths (example; `conf.customer.development`).

- The version argument now excepts a full svn url as well. You can use
  this to get a branch or fix any url to a specific revision with the
  standard svn @ syntax

- The wsgi script is no longer made executable and readable only by
  the user who ran buildout. This avoids problems with deployment.
