CHANGES
*******

0.5 (2009-02-10)
================

* Add support for ``RelationChoice`` field. To create a relation field that
  uses a drop-down list to select the relation target, implement a
  ``RelationSourceFactory`` (implement the ``getTargets`` method), and
  pass it as a source to ``RelationChoice``.

0.4 (2009-01-20)
================

* Use improved ``z3c.relationfield`` to better handle broken
  relations.  Broken relations are now accepted by the UI but will be
  stored as broken.

0.3 (2009-01-16)
================

* Pass along ``from_attribute`` and ``from_path`` URL parameters to
  explorer_url.

0.2 (2009-01-08)
================

* Update the value of the input field using ``.value`` instead of
  using ``setAttribute('value', ...)``. The latter did not update
  dynamically updated input fields, and the former does.

* ``z3c.relationfield`` does not use ``IRelationInfo`` anymore and
  instead exposes ``create_relation``. Use this instead.

0.1.1 (2008-12-10)
==================

* Small internet Explorer compatibility tweaks.

0.1 (2008-12-05)
================

* Initial public release.
