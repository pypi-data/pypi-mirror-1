Description: Pyjamas-Desktop
        ---------------
        
        Pyjamas-Desktop is a cross-platform framework and applications widget set,
        based on WebKit.  PyWebkitGtk is currently the basis for Pyjamas-Desktop,
        and it is conceivable that there will exist a PyWebkitQt4, and Pyjamas-Desktop
        will run on top of that, as well.
        
        Pyjamas-Desktop is similar to KiWi in that it provides an easy-to-use API,
        where you need not know - at all - that you are running PyGTK underneath.
        
        Pyjamas-Desktop is actually a port of Pyjamas which is a web toolkit, so you
        also have the option of running PyjamasDesktop applications as web
        applications - unmodified.
        
        The Pyjamas Widget set is exceptionally comprehensive and yet is easy to use,
        providing:
        
        * Simple, Horizontal, Vertical, Docking, Decking, Popup, Stack, Tab,
        Grid, Flow, Table and HTML Panels
        * Text Labels and HTML including full CSS Stylesheet support and
        full CSS properties
        * Input, Password and Textarea input boxes
        * List drop-downs including Multi-selection
        * Buttons, Checkboxes and Radio-Buttons including groups.
        * Form Submit Panel (providing file upload).
        * Treeview, Menu and Menubar (vertical and horizontal).
        
        Additional features, thanks to the underlying use of webkit, include:
        
        * Full CSS Stylesheet functionality, both local, remote and direct
        and simple API manipulation.
        * Option of executing javascript, for full and complete manipulation
        of the application.
        * Loading of complete HTML Pages, both local and remote; full URL support.
        * Plugin support for multimedia plugins such as Flash
        (obsoleting the need for gtk-mozplugin)
        * Access to XML, XSLT and AJAX.
        * (Future: full SVG Canvas support, like HippoCanvas)
        
        It's specifically worth noting that due to Pyjamas-Desktop's history, it purely
        provides the "V" in "MVC" applications design, and that one option presently
        in use is the JSONRPC proxy client included, for communicating with the "MC"
        in the back-end of your application. In this way, the same application
        front-end source code can be compiled with PyJamas (into Javascript/AJAX) -
        with no modifications - to run with exactly the same back-end HTTP server that
        your Pyjamas-Desktop application uses.
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        Currently, Pyjamas-Desktop requires patched versions of both Webkit and
        PyWebkitGtk, as of 01-Sep-2008.  The patches are here:
        
        * https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16401
        * http://code.google.com/p/pywebkitgtk/issues/detail?id=13
        
        
        Source Code
        -----------
        
        Pyjamas-Desktop is available as a git repository:
        
        * git://github.com/lkcl/pyjamas-desktop.git
