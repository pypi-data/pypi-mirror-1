        Password Manager
        ================
        
        This package provides a password manager mechanism. Password manager is an
        utility object that can encode and check encoded passwords. Beyond the generic
        interface, this package also provides four implementations:
        
        * PlainTextPasswordManager - the most simple and the less secure one. It does
        not do any password encoding and simply checks password by string equality.
        It's useful in tests or as a base class for more secure implementations.
        
        * MD5PasswordManager - a password manager that uses MD5 algorithm to encode
        passwords. It adds salt to the encoded password, but the salt is not used
        for encoding the password itself, so the use of salt in it is purely
        cosmetical. It's generally weak against dictionary attacks.
        
        * SHA1PasswordManager - a password manager that uses SHA1 algorithm to encode
        passwords. It has the same salt weakness as the MD5PasswordManager.
        
        * SSHAPasswordManager - the most secure password manager that is strong against
        dictionary attacks. It's basically SHA1-encoding password manager which also
        incorporates a salt into the password when encoding it. This password manager
        is compatible with passwords used in LDAP databases.
        
        It is strongly recommended to use SSHAPasswordManager, as it's the most secure.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        It's very easy to use password managers. The ``zope.password.interfaces.IPasswordManager``
        interface defines only two methods::
        
        def encodePassword(password):
        """Return encoded data for the given password"""
        
        def checkPassword(encoded_password, password):
        """Return whether the given encoded data coincide with the given password"""
        
        The implementations mentioned above are in the ``zope.password.password`` module.

        3.5.0 (2009-03-06)
        ------------------
        
        First release. This package was splitted off from ``zope.app.authentication``
        to separate password manager functionality that is greatly re-usable without
        any bit of ``zope.app.authentication`` and to reduce its dependencies.
