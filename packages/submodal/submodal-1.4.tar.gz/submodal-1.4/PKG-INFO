Description: The subModal works by placing a semi-transparent div over the browser, blocking access to the content below while still providing visibility. This maintains state and doesn't make someone feel disoriented or lost by moving them completely to another page. Their frame of reference is kept while allowing them to perform a new task (usually closely associated with the content below).
