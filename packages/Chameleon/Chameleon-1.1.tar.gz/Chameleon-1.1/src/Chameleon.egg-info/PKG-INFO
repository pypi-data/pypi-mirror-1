Description: Overview
        --------
        
        Chameleon compiles templates to Python byte-code. It includes a
        complete implementation of the Zope Page Templates (ZPT) language.
        
        The engine itself performs 10-15 times better than the reference
        implementation and real-world benchmarks show an overall performance
        improvement in complex applications of 30-50%.
        
        Compatibility
        -------------
        
        Works on Python 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6, including Google App Engine.
        
        Development
        -----------
        
        The code is maintained in a subversion repository::
        
        svn://svn.repoze.org/svn/chameleon/trunk
