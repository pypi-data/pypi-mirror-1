Description: Overview
        ========
        An easy to use multimedia transcoder for the GNOME Desktop. Arista focuses on
        being easy to
        use by making the complex task of encoding for various devices simple. Pick your
        input, pick your target device, choose a file to save to and go.
        
        Arista has been in development since early 2008 as a side project and was just
        recently polished to make it release-worthy. The 0.8 release is the first release available to the public. Please see http://www.launchpad.net/arista for information on helping out.
        
        Features
        ---------
        
        * Presets for iPod, computer, DVD player, PSP, and more
        * Live preview to see encoded quality
        * Automatically discover available DVD drives and media
        * Rip straight from DVD media easily (requires libdvdcss)
        * Automatically discover and record from V4L devices

        Requirements
        ---------------
        Arista is written in Python and requires the bindings for GTK+ 2.16 or newer,
        GStreamer, GConf, GObject, Cairo, and DBus. If you are an Ubuntu user this means
        you need to be using at least Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty). The GStreamer plugins
        required depend on the presets available, but at this time you should have
        gst-plugins-good, gst-plugins-bad, gst-plugins-ugly, and gst-ffmpeg. If you are
        on Ubuntu don't forget to install the multiverse packages.
