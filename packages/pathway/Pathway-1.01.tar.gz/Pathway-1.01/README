Pathway is a simple Python library for interacting with the filesystem. It
wraps many common file and folder operations in a clean, object-oriented
syntax.

To use it, ``import pathway`` and use the ``new`` function to create a path
object. These are all subclasses of ``PathObject`` - ``Folder`` for folders,
``File`` for files, and ``SomethingElse`` for another type of file. They all
support pathname manipulations. In addition, ``Folder`` contains methods for
listing and accesssing its children, and ``File`` makes it easy to get
information about itself and load its contents. (``SomethingElse`` just
supports path operations.)

CAVEAT: Pathway is only intended for working with paths that actually exist
on the local system. While you could obtain the path operations by directly
initializing a PathObject, it's not recommended, and there is no way to make
Pathway use other systems' path libraries (i.e. if you're on Windows you've
got ``winpath``, and if you're on Linux you've got ``posixpath``).

Pathway is released under the MIT license (see the LICENSE file for the text
thereof).
