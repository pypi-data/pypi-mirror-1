Changes
=======

1.2 (2008-10-16)
----------------

* Expose the ``DirectoryResource`` class as a component for registering
  directories as resources. This is accompanied by the ``path`` directive that
  is used to point to the directory holding resources by way of an relative (to
  the module) or absolute path. ``DirectoryResource`` components can be
  differentiated by name and layer.

1.1 (2008-09-22)
----------------

* ``meta.py`` module containing the grokkers has been split in a
  package with separate modules for the view, template, skin and
  static resources grokkers. This allows applications to use only
  grokkers they need (and maybe redefine others).

1.0 (2006-08-07)
----------------

* Created ``grokcore.view`` in July 2008 by factoring security-related
  components, grokkers and directives out of Grok.
