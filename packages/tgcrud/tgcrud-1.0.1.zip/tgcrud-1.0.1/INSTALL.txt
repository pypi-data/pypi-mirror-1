    cd tgcrud-0.9/

3) Run setup.py that will install tgcrud automatically. This step
   need to be run as root::

    python setup.py install

==================
Using easy_install
==================

The 'tgcrud' command extension is available in Python CheeseShop and TurboGears svn. 

You can use setuptools to install tgcrud with following command::

::

    $ easy_install tgcrud


or download the source code and install tgcrud manually.

Note: if you already have an old version of Cheesecake installed, easy_install
will not automatically download the latest version. You can ask for a particular
version by running for example::

    easy_install tgcrud==0.9

If you're feeling adventurous you may install development version::

    easy_install tgcrud==dev
