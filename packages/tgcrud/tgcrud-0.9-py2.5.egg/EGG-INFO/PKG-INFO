Description: 
        tgcrud is a 'no magic' crud (create, read, update, delete)
        interface generator,
        and the generated codes are fully customizable.
        tgcrud heavily use form widgets and show you many
        TG 1.0 features in it's controllers/templates.
        
        If you are a TG beginer, tgcrud could generate a admin skeleton based on your model.
        
        If you are an experienced TG developer, you could get it in minutes
        since it just done the basic procedure that every time you write a
        management interface of your model.
        
        Install
        ----------
        
        The 'tgcrud' command extension is available in Python CheeseShop and TurboGears svn.
        
        You can use setuptools to install tgcrud with following command::
        
        ::
        
        $ easy_install tgcrud
        
        or download the source code and install tgcrud manually.
        
        Usage
        ----------
        1. Define your model in model.py
        
        2. After you've defined your model,
        you could use "tg-admin crud" command to generate the crud pack.
        The syntax is::
        
        $ tg-admin crud [model class name] [package name]
        
        e.x if the model name is BookMark,
        the package name is BookMarkController, the command is::
        
        $ tg-admin crud BookMark BookMarkController
        
        Then the 'admin' package is generated.
        You just need take several minutes to customize the formfield to
        have a proper crud interface.
        
        3. Import the package to your controllers.py with a line:
        
        from BookMarkController import BookMarkController
        
        and add a branch on your Root()::
        
        foo = BookMarkController()
        
        4. Customize the form filed in admin/controllers.py
        
        5. Open the http://localhost:8080/foo to use the customizable interface.
