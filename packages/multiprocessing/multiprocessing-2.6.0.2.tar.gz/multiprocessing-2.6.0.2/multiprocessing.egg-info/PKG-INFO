        About
        -----
        
        `multiprocessing` is a back port of the Python 2.6/3.0 `multiprocessing <http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html>`_
        package. The multiprocessing package itself is a renamed and updated version of
        R Oudkerk's `pyprocessing <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/processing/>`_ package.
        This standalone variant is intended to be compatible with Python 2.4 and 2.5,
        and will draw it's fixes/improvements from python-trunk.
        
        This package would not be possible if not for the contributions of not only
        the current maintainers but all of the contributors to the original pyprocessing
        package listed `here <http://pyprocessing.berlios.de/doc/THANKS.html>`_
        
        The multiprocessing package monkey patches several aspects of the `threading`
        module to make it forward compatible with Python 2.6. The patches are
        non-intrusive and don't change existing functions. See `multiprocessing.patch`
        for detailed informations.
        
        Please refer to `<http://www.python.org/doc/2.6/library/multiprocessing.html>`_
        for more information about the `multiprocessing` package.
