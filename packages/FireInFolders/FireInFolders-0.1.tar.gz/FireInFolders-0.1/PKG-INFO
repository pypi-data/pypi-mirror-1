        ===============
        
        From usage you will see all this CLI tool does::
        
        $ ls
        test
        $ ls test/
        foobar foobar2
        $ ls test/foobar/
        changes.txt huhu.txt
        $ ls test/foobar2/
        stuff.txt
        
        $ fire_in_folder -s test ls
        changes.txt huhu.txt
        stuff.txt
        
        $ fire_in_folder -s test rm *
        $ fire_in_folder -s test touch foo.txt
        $ fire_in_folder -s test ls
        foo.txt
        foo.txt
        
        NOTES
        =====
        
        This tool was created for use with buildout and svn externals. Buildout populates src/ folder with products that need svn management (and we hate svn externals). Makes it easier to do: "fire_in_folders svn up"
