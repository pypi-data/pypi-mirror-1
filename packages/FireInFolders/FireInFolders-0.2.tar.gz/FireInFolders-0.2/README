Fire In Folders
===============

From usage you will see all this CLI tool does::

   $ ls
   test
   $ ls test/
   foobar foobar2
   $ ls test/foobar/
   changes.txt huhu.txt
   $ ls test/foobar2/
   stuff.txt

   $ fire_in_folders -s test ls
   changes.txt huhu.txt
   stuff.txt

   $ fire_in_folders -s test rm *
   $ fire_in_folders -s test touch foo.txt
   $ fire_in_folders -s test ls
   foo.txt
   foo.txt

NOTES
=====

This tool was created for use with buildout and svn externals. Buildout populates src/ folder with products that need svn management (and we hate svn externals). Makes it easier to do: "fire_in_folders svn up"
