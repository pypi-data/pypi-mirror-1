Description: This package provides a robust enumerated data type for Python.
        
        An enumeration object is created with a sequence of string
        arguments to the Enum() function::
        
        >>> from enum import Enum
        >>> Colour = Enum('red', 'blue', 'green')
        >>> Weekday = Enum('mon', 'tue', 'wed', 'thu', 'fri', 'sat', 'sun')
        
        The return value is a new object with attributes for each of the
        string arguments; these attributes act as unique values within the
        enumeration::
        
        >>> pixel_colour = Colour.blue
        
        Enumeration objects are immutable, and can iterate their values.
        The values are constants that can be compared only with other
        values from the same enumeration, but can be coerced to simple
        strings matching the original arguments to Enum().
        
        The design is based in part on Zoran Isailovski's recipe, "First
        Class Enums in Python" in the ASPN Python Cookbook
