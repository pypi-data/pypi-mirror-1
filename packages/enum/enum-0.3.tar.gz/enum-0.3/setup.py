"""This package provides a class for robust enumerations in Python.

An enumeration object is created with a sequence of string
arguments to the Enum() function::

    >>> from enum import Enum
    >>> Colours = Enum('red', 'blue', 'green')
    >>> Weekdays = Enum('mon', 'tue', 'wed', 'thu', 'fri', 'sat', 'sun')

The return value is an immutable sequence object with a value for each
of the string arguments. Each value is also available as an attribute
named from the corresponding string argument::

    >>> pizza_night = Weekdays[4]
    >>> pixel_colour = Colours.blue

The values are constants that can be compared only with other values
from the same enumeration, but can be coerced to simple strings
matching the original arguments to Enum().

The design is based in part on Zoran Isailovski's recipe, "First
Class Enums in Python" in the ASPN Python Cookbook
<URL:http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/413486>.
