  <h1>pydirstat - a simple tool to view the space used on a disk</h1>

  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>pyDirStat is a small tool to view statistical information about
    a directory. It will generate a view of all files contained in a
    directory (and subdirectories) with rectangles. Each rectangle
    area is proportional to file size. It's a perfect tool to view
    disk usage with graphics.</p>
  <h2>License</h2>
    <p>pydirstat is under <a href='http://www.opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license.php'>GPL</a>.</p>
    <p>pydirstat is hosted on berlios servers. <a href='http://developer.berlios.de'><img src='http://developer.berlios.de/bslogo.php?group_id=3108' width='124' height='32' border='0' alt='BerliOS Logo'></a></p>
    <p>pydirstat has a <a href='http://developer.berlios.de/projects/pydirstat/'>project page</a>.</p>
  <h2>Os</h2>
    <p>As a python software, in runs anywhere python runs (I hope so...).</p>
    <p><i>Windows</i> users should use the <i>.exe</i> that will install
    pydirstat on the right click of folders.</p>
    <p>Every other users should use the .tar.gz.</p>
    <p>You'll find both on the <a href='http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3108'>download page</a>.
  <h2>Output</h2>
    <p>You can generate either HTML, SVG or SWF (Flash) with pydirstat.</p>
    <p>Note that you'll need <i><a href='http://ming.sf.net/'>ming</a></i> for python to generate SWF.</p>

  <h2>Configuration</h2>
    <p>You can now configure pydirstat. <b>pds-config.py</b> is provided to help creating configuration file. It will ask few questions, and will write configuration file.</p>
    <p>In the configuration file, you will be able to change color associations.</p>
    <p>First find the configuration file by launching <b>pds-config.py</b> and answering questions. At the end, the configuration filename will be prompted.</p>
    <p>You'll find a section <b>options</b> containing your answers. And then you'll find several <b>type:...</b> sections. Those sections define the "type" associated to each file. A type is just a string like 'image' or 'sound'. Then there is the section <b>color</b> that define the color associated to a file type.</p>
    <p>There is four <b>type:</b> section.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><b>type:extension</b> : Every file ending by this extension will have the associated type. This is case sensitive. Most of unix filenames will be recognized by this section.</li>
    <li><b>type:extensionlower</b> : This is the same section exept that the exentension is lowercased (so 'asf' will match 'asf' and 'ASF'). Most of Windows filenames will be recognized by this section.</li>
    <li><b>type:exactmatch</b> : The whole file should be equal to the key. Exemple : "core" file under unix.</li>
    <li><b>type:contain</b> : The file contains the key. Exemple : ".so." to match linux libraries.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Note for windows users:</b> If this is too complex, just edit the <b>type:extensionlower</b> and the <b>color</b> sections.</p>
    <p><b>Note for unix users:</b> If this is too complex, just edit the <b>type:extension</b> and the <b>color</b> sections.</p>
