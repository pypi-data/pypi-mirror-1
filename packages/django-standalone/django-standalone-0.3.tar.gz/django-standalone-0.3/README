Simple Standalone Scripts Using the Django ORM
=====================================================

This little library is all about easing the pain of using
the Django ORM for simple tools that just happen to be in need
of some easy to use ORM for object persistence.

The best way of course is to set up a full Django project and
just use a settings.py file and using the DJANGO_SETINGS_MODULE
environment variable. But when you just want to do little tools
that just need some sqlite3 database to store some of their
data and don't want to go for a full Django project, that is
where this little library comes into play.

It consists of just two modules so far:

standalone.conf handles all the configuration needs, setting up
a dynamically created settings object.

standalone.models carries a base class for your models that
automatically tells Python that all models created actually
reside in the standalone Django app, even though they are
in a different file, outside the app's namespace.

Look at the included example_script.py to see how to make
use of this library.

The easiest way to get django-standalone is to use easy_install
or pip:

sudo easy_install django-standalone

or

sudo pip install django-standalone

Or you can clone this repository and run the included setup.py
