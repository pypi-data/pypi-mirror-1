Description: Simple Standalone Scripts Using the Django ORM
        =====================================================
        
        This little library is all about easing the pain of using
        the Django ORM for simple tools that just happen to be in need
        of some easy to use ORM for object persistence.
        
        The best way of course is to set up a full Django project and
        just use a settings.py file and using the DJANGO_SETINGS_MODULE
        environment variable. But when you just want to do little tools
        that just need some sqlite3 database to store some of their
        data and don't want to go for a full Django project, that is
        where this little library comes into play.
        
        It consists of just two modules so far:
        
        standalone.conf handles all the configuration needs, setting up
        a dynamically created settings object.
        
        standalone.models carries a base class for your models that
        automatically tells Python that all models created actually
        reside in the standalone Django app, even though they are
        in a different file, outside the app's namespace.
        
        Look at the included example_script.py to see how to make
        use of this library.
        
        The easiest way to get django-standalone is to use easy_install
        or pip:
        
        sudo easy_install django-standalone
        
        or
        
        sudo pip install django-standalone
        
        Or you can clone this repository and run the included setup.py
