Why

  Your site has huge amount of member? Or your members are store in an LDAP 
  server? You need to enable member selection in your site? Then maybe this 
  product is for you.

What

  An archetypes widget similar to the ATReferenceBrowserWidget to support
  selection of a member's id or email from a popup search window.

  It can be used without archetypes, see test_memberselect.pt in the skin 
  source code direcotry for more.
