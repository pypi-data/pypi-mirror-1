twitscreen
==========
twitscreen is a little screenshot utility that can:

- take screenshots (obviously),
- crop them,
- save them to (PNG) files,
- upload them to [Twitpic](http://www.twitpic.com).

It is of course possible to upload images with a message and to post them to [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com) as well.

twitscreen needs GTK to work properly. At the moment it has only be tested on Linux, but it may work on other platforms (*BSD, MacOS X, maybe Windows too?).

twitscreen is **free software**, published under the terms of the [ISC license](http://www.isc.org/software/license). This means that you are free to use, copy, modify and/or distribute it as long as you don't remove the license text and copyright statement included in the source files. If you wish to contribute to twitscreen, feel free to send me a patch, tell me about issues you might encounter while using it, or forking it on GitHub.

None of course :)


TODO
----
- add support for saving as JPEG and other formats. Trivial to do, but I'm not interested in it.
- add support for other image hosting sites?
