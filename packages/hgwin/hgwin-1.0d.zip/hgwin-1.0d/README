hgwin.py is a Mercurial "hg serve" manager for Windows that effectively
acts like a daemon managing instances of the hg serve command.

To install, just run `python setup.py install`. This should create an
executable program called hgwin in your PATH.  If you want to make changes
to the code (i.e. you are developing it), run `python setup.py develop`
instead, which will use your current directory directly instead of copying it
to site-packages.

Usage is pretty simple:  start hgwin (hgwin.exe in Windows), right click
on the Hg task bar icon and select New Server.  Fill out the requested
information and choose OK.  Right clicking again on the Hg icon will list the
connection in the menu, and following the submenu will allow you to choose
'Start'.  If Mercurial (hg.exe) is in your PATH environment variable, 'hg
serve' will be started with the name and port number provided.

You can use the 'Copy to clipboard' action to copy a url to the system clipboard. The
'Edit' functionality will let you modify the serving parameters, and 'Delete' will remove
the server from the configuration.

WARNING:  The configuration file is only saved at program exit for now -- so be sure to
exit cleanly.

Software Requirements:
	Python 2.5.1
