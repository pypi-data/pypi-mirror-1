What about rotating at pre-defined period rather than size based condition?
###########################################################################

Perhaps a future feature but :

* The Python logging module doesn't provide such handler.

* As a consequence, this requires more work than this one.

* Consider `sponsiring
  <http://sourceforge.net/project/project_donations.php?group_id=74634>`_
  this feature if you really need it.

Why rotatezlogs doesn't support Zope 2.7.x?
###########################################

* Because the inners of the logging configuration have changed in
  depth with Zope 2.8. Most of the bindings and configuration
  definitions are in the `component.xml` file, and it's not possible
  to write auto adaptative XML code as we do in Python with
  "try...except" or such constructs.

* Feel free to contribute and provide a `component.xml` that fits with
  Zope 2.7 configuration policy, as well as an auto adaptative scheme
  that supports Zope 2.8 and 2.9.

* Or consider `sponsiring
  <http://sourceforge.net/project/project_donations.php?group_id=74634>`_
  the Zope 2.7 support if you really need it, but can't do it yourself.
