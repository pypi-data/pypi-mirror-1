1.3.1 (2009-11-15)
------------------

* Added missing import of twisted.python.failure.

* Use db.pool with ZODB >= 3.9 and db._pools with ZODB < 3.9.
  The tests now pass with ZODB 3.9.

* Tests pass in Python 2.6.

1.3 (2008-06-19)
----------------

* Handle ZEO.Exceptions.ClientDisconnected errors: retry forever, with a
  backoff, defaulting to a max backoff of 60 seconds.

* Make number of times that ConflictErrors are retried configurable.

1.2 (2008-04-09)
----------------

* New subclass of twisted.python.failure.Failure begins with only reprs,
  and it pickles to exclude the stack, exclude the global vars in the frames,
  and truncate the reprs of the local vars in the frames.  The goal is to
  keep the pickle size of Failures down to a manageable size.  ``sanitize``
  now uses this class.

1.1 (2008-03-27)
----------------

* Now depends on twisted 8.0.1 or higher, which is newly setuptools
  compatible.  The twisted build is a little frightening, at least with
  Py2.4, with multiple warnings and errors, but works.  The dependency
  change is the reason for the bump to 1.1; this release has no new
  features.

* setup.py uses os.path

* C extension uses older comment style and has less cruft.

1.0.1 (2008-03-14)
------------------

* Bugfix: if you passed a slot method like a BTree.__setitem__, bad things
  would happen.

1.0.0 (2008-03-13)
------------------

* Add ability to specify an alternate reactor

* Use bootstrap external

0.1.1 (?)
---------

* use zc.twisted, not twisted in setup.py, until twisted is setuptools-friendly

0.1 (?)
-------

* Initial release-ish
