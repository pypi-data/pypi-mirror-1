1.1 (2008-3-27)
---------------

* Now depends on twisted 8.0.1 or higher, which is newly setuptools
  compatible.  The twisted build is a little frightening, at least with
  Py2.4, with multiple warnings and errors, but works.  The dependency
  change is the reason for the bump to 1.1; this release has no new
  features.

* setup.py uses os.path rather than assuming *nix paths

* C extension uses older comment style and has less cruft.

1.0.1 (2008-3-14)
-----------------

* Bugfix: if you passed a slot method like a BTree.__setitem__, bad things
  would happen.

1.0.0 (2008-3-13)
-----------------

* Add ability to specify an alternate reactor

* Use bootstrap external

0.1.1 (?)
---------

* use zc.twisted, not twisted in setup.py, until twisted is setuptools-friendly

0.1 (?)
-------

* Initial release-ish
