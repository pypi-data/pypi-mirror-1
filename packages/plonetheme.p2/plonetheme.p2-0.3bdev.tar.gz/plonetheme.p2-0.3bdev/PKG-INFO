Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        P2 is a lightweight, airy theme for Plone 3.0. It features a shadowed logo,
        content and footer (for those with recent browsers), elegant san serif fonts,
        with site and global tabs moved to the bottom of the page.
        
        
        Developers notes
        ================
        
        While theme can be easily generated from a paster template, unfortunately such
        themes don't deal with non-trivial uninstallation, which is needed if you move
        or hide viewlets as P2 does. Examples being thin on the ground, P2 can serve
        as case study for how to sensibly revert moved and hidden viewlets. Also see
        the references below.
