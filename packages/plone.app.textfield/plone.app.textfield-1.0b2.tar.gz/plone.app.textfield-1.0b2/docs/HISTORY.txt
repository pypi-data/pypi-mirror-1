1.0b2 - 2009-09-21
------------------

* Store the raw value in a separate persistent object in the ZODB instead of
  in a BLOB. This avoids potential problems with having thousands of small
  BLOB files, which would not be very space efficient on many filesystems.
  [optilude]

* Make the RichTextValue immutable. This greatly simplifies the code and
  avoids the need to keep track of the parent object.
