Introduction

    This is software to send auto-replies to email messages.  For example,
    let's just say that you're being overwhelmed by email to a particular
    address.  You could set up the replybot so that you send a helpful message
    to anyone that emails you.  You could also use the replybot to send
    replies for emails to your webmaster address, etc.

    You will want to be considerate with your responses though.  For example,
    you'd rather limit the responses you send to any one person so that you
    don't end up being a source of spam.  You'd also like to comply with all
    the relevant standards, including de-facto and common practices, so that
    you don't send responses to bulk email and the like.

    The Python Replybot does all this.

Requirements

    The Python Replybot software requires Python 2.5.  It also requires
    Storm, an object-relational mapper.  You will also need a database
    backend, and by default, the Python Replybot uses Python 2.5's built-in
    SQLite engine.

Documentation

    Documentation is available in the docs directory in a variety of formats.
