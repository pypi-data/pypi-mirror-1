        =========================================
        Ximenez: a multi-purpose action performer
        =========================================
        
        The purpose of Ximenez is to execute an action on a set of collected
        items. Both the action and the way items are collected, are defined by
        Python modules, which are called plug-ins. This lets you:
        
        - execute a command (and retrieve its output) on a set of remote hosts
        (via SSH);
        
        - perform various actions on a set of Zope servers (add an user,
        change his/her password, remove an user, etc.);
        
        - carry out any action that you are willing to write a Python plug-in
        for.
        
        See the `Plug-ins`_ section below to know more about Ximenez built-in
        plug-ins and how to develop your own ones.
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        You can use Ximenez with the following command-line::
        
        $ ximenez -c <collector> -a <action>
        
        ``<collector>`` and ``<action>`` are both plug-ins. The former gives
        Ximenez a set of items on which to act, and the latter is the action
        to perform on each item of this set.
        
        Hopefully, Ximenez comes with a number of useful plug-ins , e.g.::
        
        $ ximenez -c misc.readlines -a misc.log
        
        Optional arguments are available. See `usage`_ for further
        details.
        
        .. _usage: usage.txt
        
        
        Plug-ins
        ========
        
        The main characteristic of Ximenez is that it can be extended to just
        do what you need to do, by using plug-ins. There are two kinds of
        plug-ins: collectors and actions.
        
        Ximenez ships with a set of `built-in plug-ins`_. You may also want to
        take a look at the `exhaustive guide`_ to develop your own plug-ins.

        .. _exhaustive guide: develop-plugins.txt
        
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        Ximenez should run under any OS, though some plug-ins may use
        OS-specific features or require special Python packages.
        
        Python 2.4 or above is required. This program may also work with prior
        versions of Python with minor changes.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        If you have ``easy_install``, then the following should do the trick::
        
        $ easy_install ximenez
        
        For further details, see the `Installation`_ chapter.

        Subversion repository
        =====================
        
        Ximenez source code lives in a Subversion repository. To checkout the
        trunk::
        
        $ svn co https://svn.pilotsystems.net/projets/ximenez/trunk ximenez
        
        You can also `browse the sources`_ with the same URL.

        The name
        ========
        
        It all began in Jarrow. One of the cross beams had gone out askew on
        the treddle.
