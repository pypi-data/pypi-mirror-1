        ===============================
        
        This package has developed as the library of small adapters for the
        different dark purposes.
        
        Adapter mtime
        -------------
        
        Adapter mtime intdends for getting object modification time. Object
        modification time determine on the IPersistent level and this is an exactly
        in the most cases, but sometimes we need some of hooks to know object
        modification time and adapter mtime helps us in this.
        
        Adapter mtime adapts IPersistent interface to IMTime interface. IMTime interface
        has the following fields:
        
        mtime
        time of the last modification of object
        
        
        Adapter path
        ------------
        
        Adapter path intdents for getting path from root object to current, Adapter can adopt
        any objects to IPath interface. Interface IPath provide followed fields:
        
        path
        Path from root to current object maked from attribute __name__ of object in between;
        
        titledpath
        Path from root to current object maked from titles object in between. Titles getting from
        adapter title (ITitle interface);
        
        
        Adapter title
        -------------
        
        Adapter title ntdends for getting object title (for any object).  Adapter can adopt
        any objects to ITitle interface. Interface IPath provide followed fields:
        
        title
        Object title
        
        If current object has not title property, property title of object, adopted
        ti IZopeDublinCore return instead, If adopt to IZopeDublinCore is not possible,
        property __name__ or class name return instead.
        
        Adapter has been wrote in goot component style and it's posible to write adapter
        to ITitle for any specific cases.
        
        
        Adapter nsinterface
        -------------------
        
        Adapter nsinterface defince nsinterface namespace to get possibility adopt current
        object to any interfacr. Some syntax sample followed::
        
        <tal:block define="path context/++nsinterface++ng.adapter.IPath/path">
        
        </tal:block>
        
        It usefaul, basicaly, in debugging purpose.
        
        Adapter namechooser
        -------------------
        
        If this adapter will be actvated to some container, object, created in this
        container will be accept __name__ from ITitle adapter.
        
        To activate adappter, set interface ng.adapter.interfaces.INameChooserAble
        on container.
