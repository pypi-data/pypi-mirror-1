3.5.1 (2009-02-09)
------------------

- Use the new zope.copy package for ObjectCopier to provide pluggable
  copying mechanism that is not dependent on zope.location hardly.

- Move the ItemNotFoundError exception to the interfaces module as
  it's part of public API. Old import still works as we actually
  use it where it was previously defined, however, the new import
  place is preferred.

3.5.0 (2009-01-31)
------------------

- Use zope.container instead of zope.app.container.

3.4.1 (2009-01-26)
------------------

- Moved the test dependencies to a `test` extra requirement.

3.4.0 (2007-09-28)
------------------

- No further changes since 3.4.0a1.

3.4.0a1 (2007-04-22)
--------------------

- Initial release as a separate project, corresponds to
  zope.copypastemove from Zope 3.4.0a1
