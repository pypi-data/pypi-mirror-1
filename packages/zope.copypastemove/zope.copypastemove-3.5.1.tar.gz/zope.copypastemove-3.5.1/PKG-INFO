Description: Overview
        ---------
        
        This package provides Copy, Paste and Move support for content
        components in Zope.  In particular, it defines the following
        interfaces for this kind of functionality:
        
        * ``IObjectMover``,
        
        * ``IObjectCopier``,
        
        * ``IContentItemRenamer``,
        
        * ``IPrincipalClipboard``
        
        as well as standard implementations for containers and contained
        objects as known from the ``zope.container`` package.

        CHANGES
        =======
        
        3.5.1 (2009-02-09)
        ------------------
        
        - Use the new zope.copy package for ObjectCopier to provide pluggable
        copying mechanism that is not dependent on zope.location hardly.
        
        - Move the ItemNotFoundError exception to the interfaces module as
        it's part of public API. Old import still works as we actually
        use it where it was previously defined, however, the new import
        place is preferred.
        
        3.5.0 (2009-01-31)
        ------------------
        
        - Use zope.container instead of zope.app.container.
        
        3.4.1 (2009-01-26)
        ------------------
