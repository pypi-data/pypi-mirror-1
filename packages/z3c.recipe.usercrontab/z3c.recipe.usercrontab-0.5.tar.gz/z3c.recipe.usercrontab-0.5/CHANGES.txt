z3c.recipe.usercrontab changes
==============================

0.5 (2009-06-15)
----------------

* Added migration code for pre-0.5 entries without a BUILDOUT variable.
  [reinout]

* Added extra blank line in front of "BUILDOUT=..." variable to allow for
  better readability.  [reinout]

* Added "BUILDOUT=...." as environment variable for every set of crontab lines
  handled by one buildout.  This makes it much easier to spot what got added
  by which buildout (in case you have multiple) or which buildout at all (if
  you have no clue where the buildout can be found).  [reinout]
