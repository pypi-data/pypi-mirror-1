Changelog for plone.app.i18n

    (name of developer listed in brackets)

plone.app.i18n - 1.0.3 Released January 31, 2008

    - Fixed bug: all available languages in the languageselector box were
      always marked as selected, at least when using language cookies. In
      practice this meant the last language was always shown in the box and
      this language was actually never used and could not be set.
      [maurits]

    - Added more tests. 100% test coverage now.
      [hannosch]

    - Added more tests for language and countries utilities. Fixed some
      call-by-reference bugs with lists found while writing those.

plone.app.i18n - 1.0.2 Released January 9, 2008

    - Undo the damage from r17682 which removed the language code from the
      return value of LanguageSelector.languages. This broke the language
      selectors, which is mostly noticeable by LinguaPlone no longer working.

plone.app.i18n - 1.0.1 Released December 24, 2007

    - Fixed the languages method of the selector to include the native
      language code.

    - Fixed stupid bug in using super().

      [hannosch]

    - Only show the language selector viewlet when cookie language negotiation
      is enabled.
      [hannosch]

plone.app.i18n - 1.0b3 Released May 1, 2007

    - Added id to language selector markup. Moved language selector to the
      right side in the breadcrumbs line.
      [fschulze]

    - Fixed spelling error.
      [wichert]

    - Use getToolByName instead of getUtility again. Updated language chooser
      viewlet to be more defensive, when there's no language tool available.
      This closes https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6559.
