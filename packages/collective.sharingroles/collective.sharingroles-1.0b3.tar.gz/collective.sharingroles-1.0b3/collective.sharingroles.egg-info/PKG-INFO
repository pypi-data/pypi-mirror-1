Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package provides services for managing the roles shown on the 'Sharing'
        page in Plone.
        
        Specifically, it provides a GenericSetup handler to export/import the
        available roles. The file should be called `sharing.xml`, and have the
        following format::
        
        <sharing>
        <role
        id="CopyEditor"
        title="Can edit copy"
        permission="Manage portal"
        />
        <sharing>
        
        The id must match a role already installed (e.g. with rolemap.xml). The title
        is the name to be shown on the sharing page. The required_permission is
        optional. If given, the user must have this permission to be allowed to manage
        the particular role.
