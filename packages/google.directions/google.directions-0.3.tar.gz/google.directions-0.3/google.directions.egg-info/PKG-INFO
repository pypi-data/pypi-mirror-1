Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This lib allows you to query the google direction api from your python code,
        i.e. without a browser.
        The parser will give you a dict of anything that google knows about the
        direction: Distance, waypoints, corrected addresses and much more.
        
        Although you have direct access to the parser output, you may also use the
        convenient api as seen in the Usage part below.

        Usage
        =====
        >>> from google.directions import GoogleDirections
        >>> gd = GoogleDirections('your-google-directions-key')
        >>> res = gd.query('berlin','paris')
        >>> res.distance
        1055351
        
        You also have access to the raw parser data:
        
        >>> res.result["Directions"]["Duration"]
        {u'seconds': 34329, u'html': u'9 hours 32 mins'}
        
        Have fun!
