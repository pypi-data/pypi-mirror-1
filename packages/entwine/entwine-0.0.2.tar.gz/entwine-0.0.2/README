Installation
------------

You can install entwine with ``easy_install entwine`` or install from the `subversion
repository <http://entwine.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/#egg=entwine-dev>`_
with ``easy_install entwine==dev``.



Summary
-------

entwine is a command-line client for accessing information from twine.com
It is just a beginning and very bare-bones, due to the fact that there really is no public API yet ;)


Usage Examples::

    $ entwine -p <username>
         List a user's Twine profile.

    $ entwine --raw -p <username>
         List a user's Twine profile in raw RDF.


Changes
-------
**0.0.2**: Initial RDF support using rdflib

**0.0.1**: Initial release.


Requirements
------------

* setuptools

* ConfigObj

* rdflib
