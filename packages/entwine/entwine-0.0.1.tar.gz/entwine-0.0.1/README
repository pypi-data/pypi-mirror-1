Installation
------------

You can install entwine with ``easy_install entwine`` or install from the `subversion
repository <http://entwine.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/#egg=entwine-dev>`_
with ``easy_install entwine==dev``.



Summary
-------

entwine is a command-line client for accessing information from twine.com
It is just a beginning and very bare-bones, due to the fact that there really is no public API yet ;)


Usage Examples::

    $ entwine -p <username>
         List a user's Twine profile. It only shows the raw RDF for now. The next version will parse the RDF and show it in human-readable format.


Changes
-------
