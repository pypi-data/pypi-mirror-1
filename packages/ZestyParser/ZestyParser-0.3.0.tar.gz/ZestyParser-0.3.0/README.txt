ZestyParser is a small parsing toolkit for Python. It doesn't use the traditional separated lexer/parser approach, nor does it make you learn a new ugly syntax for specifying grammar. It is based entirely on Python regular expressions and callbacks; its flow is very simple, but can accomodate a vast array of parsing situations.
