Note that since all services are not always available, connection
timeouts and HTTP errors are not treated as test failures.  

Client and Server stubs will be generated for each test, but 
the Server stubs will are runtime tested only if "local" is 
specified and an executable is provided via the "servers"
section.

To run all "working" tests:
    %./runTests.py



TODO: 
    change all "test_" methods to "test_rpc_" or "test_nonrpc"


DIRECTORIES:
     "stubs" -- 
         Generated code, regenerated everytime a test is run.

     "servers" -- 
         Server code, this is an implemenation of service and must
         be an executable.  It is also hand coded.


CONFIGURATION:
    Edit "config.txt", short descriptions are provided inline.

    [configuration]
    The "configuation" section for global configuration.

    "tracefile" -- show XML of individual messages as serialized/parsed.
    "debug" -- turn on verbose debugging information.

    "net" --  run network tests, this is a client-only test.
    "local" -- run local tests, this is client and server.  A server process
        will be spawned, for this to actually run an executable must be 
        specified in the "servers" section.
    "host" -- for local tests the hostname where server will be ran.
    "port" -- for local tests the port where server will be ran.

    Sections to categorize all tests...
    All these sections contain a "test" option, this is a whitespace
    separated list of all the tests that belong in a particular section.

    **Each entry in "test" list is used as an option in below sections.**

    [WSDL]
    URL to WSDL for particular service.

    [servers]
    Paths to executable ServiceContainer which is configured with the 
    required service instance(s).  If configuration option "local" is
    True, but a path to server executable doesn't exist no server-side
    tests will be ran.
