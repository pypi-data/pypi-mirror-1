Description: Recipe for createing a Zope 3 instance
        ======================================
        
        This recipe takes the following options:
        
        zope3
        The name of a section providing a Zope 3 installation definition.
        This defaults to zope3.  The section is required to have a
        location option giving the location of the installation.  This
        could be a section used to install a part, like a Zope 3 checkout,
        or simply a section with a location option pointing to an existing
        install.
        
        database
        The name of a section defining a zconfig option that has a zodb
        section.
        
        user
        The user name and password for manager user
        
        eggs
        One or more requirements for distributions to be included.
        
        zcml
        
        If specified, provides the list of package ZCML files to include in
        the instance's package includes and their order.
        
        By default, the ZCML files normally included in package-includes
        are ommitted.  To includes these, include '*' in the list of
        includes.
        
        Each entry is a package name with an optional include type and file
        name.  An package name can be optionally followed by a ':' and a
        file name within the package.  The default file name is
        configure.zcml.  The string '-meta' can be included between the
        file name and the package name. If so, then the default file name
        is meta.zcml and the include will be treated as a meta include.
        Similarly for '-overrides'. For example, the include::
        
        foo.bar
        
        Causes the file named NNN-foo.bar-configure.zcml to be inserted
        into package-includes containing:
        
        <include package="foo.bar" file="configure.zcml" />
        
        where NNN is a 3-digit number computed from the order if the entry
        in the zcml option.
        
        The include:
        
        foo.bar-meta
        
        Causes the file named NNN-foo.bar-meta.zcml to be inserted
        into package-includes containing:
        
        <include package="foo.bar" file="meta.zcml" />
        
        The include:
        
        foo.bar-overrides:x.zcml
        
        Causes the file named NNN-foo.bar-overrides.zcml to be inserted
        into package-includes containing:
        
        <include package="foo.bar" file="x.zcml" />
        
        
        To do
        -----
        
        - Need tests
        
        - Hopefully, for Zope 3.4, we'll be able to make the instance-creation
        process more modular, which will allow a cleaner implementation for
        this recipe.
        
        - Support for multiple storages
        
        - Support for more configuration options.
