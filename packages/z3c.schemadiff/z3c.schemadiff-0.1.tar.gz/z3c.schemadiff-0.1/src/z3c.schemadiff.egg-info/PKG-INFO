Description: Overview
        ========
        
        A diff tool that bridges zope.schema with difflib.
        
        It allows you to take two objects and retrieve a field-by-field diff;
        fields are chosen based on all implemented interfaces, unless
        explicitly specified.
        
        A browser view is included to easily display a diff between two
        objects using difflib's ``HtmlDiff``-class.
