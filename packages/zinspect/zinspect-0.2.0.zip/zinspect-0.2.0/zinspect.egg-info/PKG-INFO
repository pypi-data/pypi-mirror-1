Description: 
        zinspect
        ========
        
        Inspects objects/classes to enforce that they respect the zope.interface
        they declare to implement/provide. It works with zope.interfaces.
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        the unit tests provided with the source package contain a lot of examples
        of how to use the package to validate objects and classes.
        
        Discussion
        ----------
        
        I have written this package mainly out of a specific need for ensuring that
        plugins I load into my application would always implement the interfaces they
        declared to implement. This is a way to ensure that the application using the
        plugin won't encounter an exception trying to access an attribute that should
        be present but is not.
        
        Status
        ------
        The package is in its early infancy and will not detect an attribute
        that is created outside the __init__ method or not present directly on the
        class itself. This could be added in the future if there is enough demand.
