Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        `buildout.extensionscripts` is a convenient way to shoot yourself in the foot
        and provides more than enough rope to hang yourself.
        
        With that out of the way, we can look what it can be used for.
        
        To use `buildout.extensionscripts`, you add it as an extension in a buildout
        like this::
        
        [buildout]
        extensions = buildout.extensionscripts
        
        After that you can add one or more lines like the following to the `buildout`
        section::
        
        extension-scripts =
        ${buildout:directory}/somescript.py:callable_name
        
        When you do that, you got an easy way to write a buildout extensions without
        the need of an egg. The `callable_name` in `somescript.py` will be called
        with one argument which is the dictionary like buildout config.
        
        Now have fun shooting and or hanging yourself by changing that.
