Description: Overview
        ========
        
        This package provides a WSGI middleware component which transforms and
        converts image streams using PIL.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        The middleware works by looking for a "traversing directive"::
        
        <img src="http://host/path/bitblt-640x480/image.jpg" />
        
        When a request comes in that matches the directive, the image is
        transformed and the directive is removed from the request.
        
        However, by specifying ``width`` and ``height`` attributes in
        <img>-tags in served HTML documents, the middleware will do this
        rewriting itself.
        
        As such, the middleware is transparent: adding it to the pipeline
        merely makes pages load more effectively, since images will be scaled
        to desired size.

        0.4 (released 2008-10-11)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Fixed path handling. [malthe]
        
        - Added HTML document processing which scans document for image tags
        and rewrite image ``src`` attribute to include "bitblt" traversing
        directive. This makes it work as an actual middleware, since the
        application semantics are then unchanged. [malthe]
        
        - No longer accept query parameters, but instead require traversing
        directive "/bitblt-<width>x<height>". [malthe]
        
        - Removed functionality to MIME-type convert. [malthe]
        
        0.3 (released 2008-10-10)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Made logic robust to unexpected parameters. [malthe]
        
        - Fixed bug where parameters would be drawn from the WSGI environment. [malthe]
        
        - Added mimetype conversion. [malthe]
        
        0.2 (released 2008-10-08)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Fixed entry point name.
        
        0.1 (released 2008-10-03)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Initial release.
