Description: Overview
        ========
        
        This package provides a WSGI middleware component which automatically
        scales images according to the ``width`` and ``height`` property in
        the <img> tag.
        
        To configure the middleware, pass in a string for ``secret``; this may
        be any string internal to the system.
        
        You can also set ``filter`` to select the scaling filter. The available
        filters are ``nearest``, ``bilinear``, ``bicubic`` and ``antialias``. The
        default is ``antialias``.
        
        If you want to change the compression level for JPEG images, then you can set
        the ``quality`` option to a value between 1 (worst) and 95 (best). The default
        is 80.
        
        By default all image URLs are rewritten. With ``limit_to_application_url``
        you can limit the rewriting to relative URLs and absolute URLs below the
        application URL.
        
        If you want to use namespaces for tags in your content, then you need to
        specify ``try_xhtml`` which uses an XML parser for the content and preserves
        namespaces. This is useful if you use esi:include for example. Your content
        needs to be well formed for this to work, that includes a proper doctype etc.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        The middleware operates in two phases, on HTML documents and images
        respectively.
        
        When processing HTML documents, it looks for image tags in the
        document soup::
        
        <img src="some_image.png" width="640" height="480" />
        
        In the case it finds such an image element, it rewrites the URL to
        include scaling information which the middleware will read when the
        image is served through it.
        
        The image will be proportionally scaled, so it fits into the given size. If
        you only set one of width or height, then the image will only be limited to
        that, but still proportionally scaled.
        
        This effectively means that application developers needn't worry about
        image scaling; simply put the desired size in the HTML document.
        
        Note that this middleware is protected from DoS attacks (which is
        important for any middleware that does significant processing) by
        signing all URLs with an SHA digest signature.

        0.7 (released 2009-03-18)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Don't use python 2.6 syntax.
        [seletz]
        
        - Handle empty content bodies, which can occure for redirects.
        [fschulze]
        
        - Added support for xhtml, which allows the inclusion of namespace tags.
        [fschulze]
        
        - Added option to limit the url rewriting to urls below the application url.
        [fschulze]
        
        - Added scaling filter support.
        [fschulze]
        
        - Support image tags with only one of the width or height attributes set.
        [fschulze]
        
        - Fix UnboundLocalError for respones with untransformed image.
        [fschulze]
        
        - Fix importing of PIL. The old way assumed the broken egg installation.
        [fschulze]
        
        - Made tests run.
        [fschulze]
        
        0.6 (released 2008-10-11)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Require to pass in a ``secret`` parameter to configure middleware
        security. [malthe]
        
        0.5 (released 2008-10-11)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Rewritten URLs are now signed by the middleware to ensure that
        bitblt requests are only crafted by the middleware. This is required
        to shield against DoS attacks. [malthe]
        
        0.4 (released 2008-10-11)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Fixed path handling. [malthe]
        
        - Added HTML document processing which scans document for image tags
        and rewrite image ``src`` attribute to include "bitblt" traversing
        directive. This makes it work as an actual middleware, since the
        application semantics are then unchanged. [malthe]
        
        - No longer accept query parameters, but instead require traversing
        directive "/bitblt-<width>x<height>". [malthe]
        
        - Removed functionality to MIME-type convert. [malthe]
        
        0.3 (released 2008-10-10)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Made logic robust to unexpected parameters. [malthe]
        
        - Fixed bug where parameters would be drawn from the WSGI environment. [malthe]
        
        - Added mimetype conversion. [malthe]
        
        0.2 (released 2008-10-08)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Fixed entry point name.
        
        0.1 (released 2008-10-03)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Initial release.
