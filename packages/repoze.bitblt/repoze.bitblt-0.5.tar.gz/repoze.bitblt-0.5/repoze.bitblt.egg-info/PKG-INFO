Description: Overview
        ========
        
        This package provides a WSGI middleware component which automatically
        scales images according to the ``width`` and ``height`` property in
        the <img> tag.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        The middleware operates in two phases, on HTML documents and images
        respectively.
        
        When processing HTML documents, it looks for image tags in the
        document soup::
        
        <img src="some_image.png" width="640" height="480" />
        
        In the case it finds such an image element, it rewrites the URL to
        include scaling information which the middleware will read when the
        image is served through it.
        
        This effectively means that application developers needn't worry about
        image scaling; simply put the desired size in the HTML document.
        
        Note that this middleware is protected from DoS attacks (which is
        important for any middleware that does significant processing) by
        signing all URLs with an SHA digest signature.

        Changelog
        ---------
        
        0.5 (released 2008-10-11)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Rewritten URLs are now signed by the middleware to ensure that
        bitblt requests are only crafted by the middleware. This is required
        to shield against DoS attacks. [malthe]
        
        0.4 (released 2008-10-11)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Fixed path handling. [malthe]
        
        - Added HTML document processing which scans document for image tags
        and rewrite image ``src`` attribute to include "bitblt" traversing
        directive. This makes it work as an actual middleware, since the
        application semantics are then unchanged. [malthe]
        
        - No longer accept query parameters, but instead require traversing
        directive "/bitblt-<width>x<height>". [malthe]
        
        - Removed functionality to MIME-type convert. [malthe]
        
        0.3 (released 2008-10-10)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Made logic robust to unexpected parameters. [malthe]
        
        - Fixed bug where parameters would be drawn from the WSGI environment. [malthe]
        
        - Added mimetype conversion. [malthe]
        
        0.2 (released 2008-10-08)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Fixed entry point name.
        
        0.1 (released 2008-10-03)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Initial release.
