Congratulations! You are now a  proud new user of the Pyastre embedded
Python implementation for the Asterisk PBX.

Installation  should be fairly  painless, a  good way  to start  is by
running

	python setup.py build

If that completes successfully, you can now run

	python setup.py install

And everything should be in place.

There are only two things left to do:

1. Load the module from Asterisk
================================

The module is in a non-standard place as far as Asterisk is concerned,
usually something like /usr/lib/python2.3/site-packages/_pyastre.so.
You should  add a line  to your /etc/asterisk/modules.conf  that looks
like this:

load => /usr/lib/python2.3/site-packages/_pyastre.so

Note, you may, depending on your operating system's shared library 
implementation, have to recompile asterisk and add -lpython2.3 to the
linker arguments.

2. Create the entry points
==========================

The  embedded interpreter  calls Python  functions on  occasion. These
functions are left  for you to implement. When  the interpreter starts
up, it will do the equivalent of

    from softswitch import run, stop, cdr, pdb

So  you  must make  sure  that there  is  a  module called  softswitch
somewhere in your PYTHONPATH. Fortunately  there is a place for you to
put your Asterisk-specific things, which, by default, is 
/etc/asterisk/site-python

For convenience, there  are a couple of example  softswitch modules in
the examples/ subdirectory of this distribution, which you can copy to
/etc/asterisk/site-python/softswitch.py
