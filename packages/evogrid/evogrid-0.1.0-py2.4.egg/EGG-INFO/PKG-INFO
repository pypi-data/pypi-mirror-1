Description: Componentized Machine Learning system whose design is mainly based on
        Evolutionary Computation ideas, especially Memetic Computing: building blocks
        are ``Replicators`` that evolve in a potentially networked environment.
        
        The goal of EvoGrid is to provide a pluggable framework (based on the Zope
        Component Architecture) and reuse as much as possible existing ML algorithms
        implementations (either in Python or other language as long as the can be
        wrapped into a pythonic component).
        
        The project is currently at an early development stage providing only
        implementation for base evolutionary components (not GRID / networking support
        yet).
        
        For more details of what is included and what is planned, please refer to the
