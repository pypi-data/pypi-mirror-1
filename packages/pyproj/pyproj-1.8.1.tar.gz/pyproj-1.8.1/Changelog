1.8.1: 
 * if given tuples, returns tuples (instead of lists).
 * test for numpy arrays first.
 * build directly from .pyx file if USE_PYREX set and Pyrex installed.
 * Fixed error in docstring example.
 * README.html contains html docstrings generated by pydoc.
 * Renamed pyproj.so to _pyproj.so, created a new python module
   called pyproj.py.  Moved as code as possible from _pyproj.so to
   pyproj.py.
 * docstring examples now executed by doctest when 'pyproj.test()' is run.
 * added test to _pyproj.c which defines Py_ssize_t for python < 2.5. 
   This is necessary when pyrex 0.9.5 is used.
1.8.0: 
 * Better error handling Proj.__init__.
 * Added optional keyword 'errcheck' to __call__ method. 
 * If True, an exception is raised if the transformation is invalid.
1.7.3: 
 * python 2.5 support.
