Description: collective.ui.ie6nomore
        =======================
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        **Enough is enough**. Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 was released in late 2001.
        For its time, it was a decent browser, but in 2009, it is still in use by a
        significant portion of the web population, and its time is now up.
        
        This is a Plone 3 implementation of the code available at http://www.ie6nomore.com/.
        
        Embrace this campaign, support this noble cause.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        - Plone 3.3.x (http://plone.org/products/plone)
        
        - Plone 3.2.x (http://plone.org/products/plone)
        
        - Plone 3.1.x (http://plone.org/products/plone)
        
        - Plone 3.0.x (http://plone.org/products/plone)
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To use this package, on a buildout based installation:
        
        1. Unpack collective.ui.ie6nomore package to src/ folder of your
        buildout
        2. Edit your buildout.cfg and add the following information::
        
        [buildout]
        ...
        eggs =
        collective.ui.ie6nomore
        
        [instance]
        zcml =
        ...
        collective.ui.ie6nomore
        
        The last line tells buildout to generate a zcml snippet that tells
        Zope to configure collective.ui.ie6nomore.
        
        If another package depends on the collective.ui.ie6nomore egg or
        includes its zcml directly you do not need to specify anything in the
        buildout configuration: buildout will detect this automatically.
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run the ''bin/buildout'',
        which will take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in the Plone interface and click on the
        'Add/Remove Products' link.
        
        Choose the product (check its checkbox) and click the 'Install' button.
        
        Uninstall -- This can be done from the same management screen, but only
        if you installed it from the quick installer.
        
        Note: You may have to empty your browser cache to see the effects of the
        product installation.
