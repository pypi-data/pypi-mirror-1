repoze.mailin Changelog
=======================

0.1.4 (2009-05-04)
------------------

- Fixed case where pop with multiple pending IDs and a given isolation level
  would cause the delete to fail with 'database locked'.  See:
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/karl3/+bug/364251

- Fixed bug found by inspection where "underflow" on pop would leave the
  message IDs which *had* been returned on the queue.


0.1.3 (2009-03-13)
------------------

- Added ``PendingQueue.__del__`` to ensure closing the SQL connection.

- ``MaildirStore.drainInbox``:  don't remove the message from the maildir
  until after adding to the store.


0.1.2 (2009-01-22)
------------------

- Made 'draino' script explicitly commit sqlite transactions if not running
  in 'dry-run' mode.

- Added ``isolation_level`` argument to ``MaildirStore.__init__``, to allow
  control of how the queue commits transactions.  The default, ``None``, 
  causes the connection to defer commits.


0.1.1 (2009-01-16)
------------------

- Added ``isolation_level`` argument to ``PendingQueue.__init__``, to allow
  control of how the queue commits transactions.  The default, ``None``, 
  causes the connection to defer commits.


0.1 (2009-01-15)
