        Changelog
        =========
        
        2.0a2 - 2009-11-13
        ------------------
        
        - Fix an error introduced by my previous adjustment. If a skin layer
        extending the default layer was used (which is typical), then the
        default layer would end up with higher precedence than browser
        layers not extending the default layer.
        [davisagli]
        
        - Inherit from the CMFDefault layer again, for compatibility with products
        that depend only on CMF but are also usable within Plone, and register
        views to the CMFDefault layer.
        [davisagli]
        
        2.0a1 - 2009-04-05
        ------------------
        
        - Avoid inheriting from the CMFDefault browser layer and rather define our
        own. We don't have anything in common with the CMFDefault layer.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Declare test dependencies in an extra.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Specify package dependencies.

        1.1 - 2009-04-04
        ----------------
        
        - Make sure the theme layer takes precedence over other browser layers.
        [davisagli]
        
        1.0 - 2007-08-15
        ----------------
