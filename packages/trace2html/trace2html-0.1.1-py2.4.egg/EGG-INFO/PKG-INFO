        `trace2html` is a utility to convert execution coverage data obtained
        with the `trace` module of the standard python library into a set of human
        readable HTML documents showing sortable summary and annotated source files.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        As usual, you can either use `sudo easy_install -U trace2html` or extract the
        archive and run::
        
        $ sudo python setup.py install
        
        Sample usage
        ============
        
        Generate coverage data in the 'counts' file with trace.py::
        
        $ /usr/lib/python2.4/trace.py -mc -C coverage_dir -f counts my_testrunner.py
        
        Write a report in directory 'coverage_dir' from data collected in 'counts'::
        
        $ trace2html.py -f counts -o coverage_dir
        $ firefox coverage_dir/index.html
        
        Load data from several files (the report is written to 'coverage_dir' by
        default)::
        
        $ trace2html.py -f file1 -f2 file2
        $ firefox coverage_dir/index.html
        
        
        Licensing
        =========
        
        `trace2html` is released under the GNU/GPL v2 license (see COPYING.txt for more
        details) and uses the
        
        I would not mind relicensing `trace2html` under a more liberal license such as
        the Python or ZPL licenses but that would only be useful if someone find or
        write a replacement for the WebFX Sortable Table JS file under a similar
        license. SortableTable.js is currently under GPLv2.
