Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package provides a new portlet for Plone 3 called "Workflow steps". It
        can be configured to show:
        
        * A custom header
        * Some lead-in rich text, if desired
        * The state of the current object, including that state's full description
        * All available transitions, optionally with their full descriptions
        
        State and transition descriptions are rendered as HTML. Furthermore, the
        following special variables may be used.
        
        ${portal_url} -- The url of the portal (or navigation) root
        ${object_url} -- The url of the current object
        ${folder_url} -- The url of the current folder
        
        The idea is to make it possible to present a list of "next steps" as part of
        the workflow, including links to edit forms and the like.
