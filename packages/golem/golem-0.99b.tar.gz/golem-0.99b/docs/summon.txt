SUMMON:

summon acts as a simple data extraction service, driven
by golem. It fulfils the place of a grep or awk script in
a workflow.

summon acts on an XML file, and extracts data corresponding
to various concepts, using friendly names, and hiding the 
golem internals from view.

An example usage of summon would be:

summon -t energy -t pressure -d map.dict.cml *.xml

which means:

"for each file *.xml, extract the energy and pressure
(defined according to the map.dict.xml file, see below)"

The results will be presented as CSV output, one line
per file.

SUMMON DICTIONARY:

In order to define the friendly names for use in a given
project, summon expects a simple golem dictionary file - 
an example can be found in map.dict.xml. This file should
be a dictionary in the http://cmlcomp.org/golem/summon
namespace (which is defined only to be used by summon), and
maps Entrys within that namespace (called, for example
"energy", or "pressure", according to your needs) to 
Entrys in more complex dictionaries. 

Thus the user need know nothing about the internals of
the various golem dictionaries to hand, so long as a
mapping dictionary is available for the project at hand.
