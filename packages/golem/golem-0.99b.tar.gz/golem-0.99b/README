DEPENDENCIES:
============

No external dependencies are necessary for installing
golem, apart from Python 2.4 or later.

(golem does rely on lxml & simplejson, but these are 
included in the golem distribution and will be taken
care of automatically)

INSTALLATION:
============

There are two ways to install.


Easy
----

For end-users of Golem tools who don't intend to do any
development - simply do:

> make install

To install somewhere else than /usr/local, do:

> make install DESTDIR=/path/to/location

(you may need to do these commands with sudo)


Expert
------

For advanced users, or people who intend to develop 
applications with the library - there is a setuptools-based
installation process. This can be invoked by:

> python setup.py install

which will download and build all external dependencies
(lxml and simplejson)
