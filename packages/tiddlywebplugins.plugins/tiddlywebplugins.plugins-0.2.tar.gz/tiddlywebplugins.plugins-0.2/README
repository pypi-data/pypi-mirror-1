tiddlywebplugins.plugins is a system_plugin for TiddlyWeb which
will read a file in the current instance as a list of additional
system_plugins to add to the instance.

This is done so automation of the plugins currently in use in 
an instance is more flexible.

To use, add 'tiddlywebplugins.plugins' to system_plugins in
tiddlywebconfig.py. Add other system_plugins to a file named
'extra_plugins'. This file can be overridden by setting 'plugin_file'
in tiddlywebconfig.py.
