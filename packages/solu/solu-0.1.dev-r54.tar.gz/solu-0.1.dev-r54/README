Solu
====

Solu is a simple web application meant for making it easy to
find colleagues, meeting rooms and other resources in an office. It has a self
service model without any authentication or permission checks, where anyone
can find and update any resource's information. 

The name "Solu" comes from  "Self-service Office Locator and Updater". It
is also a word in the Finnish language and means "cell" (biology).

Install
-------

- ``easy_install solu``
- (OR if you don't have ``setuptools`` installed, download the sources and then:
  ``python setup.py install``)

Demo
----

- ``solu deploy``
- ``solu demodb``
- ``solu runserver localhost 8080``

Deploy
------

- Create the database and write settings to ini file:
  ``solu deploy --url="sqlite:///solu.db" --data="./data"`` (you might want to
  use a different database engine and absolute ``data`` url)
- Copy your office map file into ``./data/maps/map.png`` file
- Either serve with Werkzeug_'s webserver, for example:
  ``solu runserver localhost 8080``
- Or create a WSGI configuration file that gets invoked with your favorite
  WSGI gateway. Sample configuration::
  
    from solu.application import Solu
    application = Solu('/path/to/deploy.ini')
