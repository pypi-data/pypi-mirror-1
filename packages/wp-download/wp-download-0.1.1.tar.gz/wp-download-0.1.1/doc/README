Documentation
=============

The documentation for wp-download is generated from rst files. You will
have to install python-sphinx [1] if you want html or txt documentation.

After that just call make with one of the following targets:

    * all   - build html and txt
    * text  - build txt documentation
    * html  - build html documentation
