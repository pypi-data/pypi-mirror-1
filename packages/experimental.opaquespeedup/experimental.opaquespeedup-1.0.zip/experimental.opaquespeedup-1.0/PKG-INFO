Description: 
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        `experimental.opaquespeedup` is an approach to speed up event handling in
        Plone 3.  Currently all events on content objects are getting dispatched to
        so called "opaque" objects, which are sub-objects not handled by `OFS`'s
        `ObjectManager` class.  Apart from the commenting framework such objects are
        mostly unused nowadays.  However, for dispatching every single fired events
        `CMFCatalogAware`'s rather expensive method `opaqueItems` is used in order to
        collect all "opaque" objects for a given folderish object.  The method call
        wakes up all objects in the folder and is completely uncached.  So the more
        objects reside in a folder and the more event subscribers are being used by
        the system, the slower things get.  And all events count.
        
        This package tries to optimize things by replacing `opaqueItems` with a
        version that'll query the catalog for contained "opaque" objects and cache
        the results.  Initial tests indicate a significant performance improvement.
