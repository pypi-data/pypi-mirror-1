Changes
=======

0.9.2 (2008-08-08)
------------------

* Grokker mistakenly relied on (not imported) ``GrokImportError`` in failure
  case. Corrected this to ``GrokError`` and added a test for it.

* Rename ``use`` directive to ``depend`` and make it take a class
  argument instead of a library name.

0.9.1 (2008-08-06)
------------------

* Turn off zip-safeness.

* Actually add a meta.zcml that loads up the grokker!

0.9 (2008-08-06)
----------------

* Initial public release.
