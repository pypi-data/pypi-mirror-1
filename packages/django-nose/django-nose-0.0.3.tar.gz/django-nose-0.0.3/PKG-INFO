Description: ============
        Requirements
        ============
        
        This package is most useful when installed with:
        
        * Django
        * nosetests
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        You can get django-nose from pypi with: ::
        
        pip install django-nose
        
        The development version can be installed with: ::
        
        pip install -e git://github.com/jbalogh/django-nose.git#egg=django-nose
        
        Since django-nose extends Django's built-in test command, you should add it to
        your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in ``settings.py``: ::
        
        INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'django_nose',
        ...
        )
        
        Then set ``TEST_RUNNER`` in ``settings.py``: ::
        
        TEST_RUNNER = 'django_nose.run_tests'
        
        If you are using ``django.contrib.gis`` (GeoDjango) and need a spatial database
        to run your tests, use the GIS test runner instead: ::
        
        TEST_RUNNER = 'django_nose.run_gis_tests'
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        See ``django help test`` for all the options nose provides, and look to the `nose
        docs`_ for more help with nose.
        
        Caveats
        -------
        
        `South`_ installs its own test command that turns off migrations during
        testing.  Make sure that ``django_nose`` comes *after* ``south`` in
        ``INSTALLED_APPS`` so that django_nose's test command is used.
