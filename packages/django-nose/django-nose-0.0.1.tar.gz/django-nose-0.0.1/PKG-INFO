Description: ## Requirements
        
        This package is most useful when installed with:
        
        * Django
        * nosetests
        
        ## Installation
        
        You can get django-nose from pypi with:
        
        pip install django-nose
        
        The development version can be installed with:
        
        pip install -e git://github.com/jbalogh/django-nose.git#egg=django-nose
        
        Since django-nose extends Django's built-in test command, you should add it to
        your `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`:
        
        INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'django_nose',
        ...
        )
        
        Then set `TEST_RUNNER` in `settings.py`:
        
        TEST_RUNNER = 'django_nose.run_tests'
        
        ## Usage
        
        See `django help test` for all the options nose provides, and look to the [nose
        docs][1] for more help with nose.

        ## Caveats
        
        [South][2] installs its own test command that turns off migrations during
        testing.  Make sure that 'django_nose' comes *after* 'south' in `INSTALLED_APPS`
        so that django_nose's test command is used.
