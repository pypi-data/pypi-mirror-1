Products.Andreas09Theme Package Readme
======================================

Overview
--------

An example theme for Plone 3.0.

The original design of the theme was created by Andreas Viklund.
See http://andreasviklund.com/ for more information on the design itself.

This product is a step-by-step example code used in the 18th chapter of the
'Practical Plone' book published by Packt Publishing.

The package is not meant to become a complete theme covering all graphical
aspects that can be applied on a Plone site.

Each of the different releases represent a step in the process of
adapting the original design to Plone.
