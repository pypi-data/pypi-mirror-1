        Overview
        --------
        
        An example theme for Plone 3.0.
        
        The original design of the theme was created by Andreas Viklund.
        See http://andreasviklund.com/ for more information on the design itself.
        
        This product is a step-by-step example code used in the 18th chapter of the
        'Practical Plone' book published by Packt Publishing.
        
        The package is not meant to become a complete theme covering all graphical
        aspects that can be applied on a Plone site.
        
        Each of the different releases represent a step in the process of
        adapting the original design to Plone.
