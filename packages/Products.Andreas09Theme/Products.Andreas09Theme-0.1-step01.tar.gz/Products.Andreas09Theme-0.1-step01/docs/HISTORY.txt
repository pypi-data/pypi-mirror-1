Changelog for Products.Andreas09Theme
=====================================

Products.Andreas09Theme - 1.0 Unreleased
----------------------------------------

- Initial package structure. See Products.Andreas09Theme/docs/ZopeSkel.txt
  [zopeskel]

STEP 01 - Preparation
---------------------

Note: These tasks should be performed right after the code was generated by
ZopesSkel, preferably before installing the theme product.
In any case, a Zope (re)start will be needed after applying them.

- Change the name of the Product GS profile to
  give it a name that makes obvious in the installer that it is a theme.

  In Products.Andreas09Theme/Products/Andreas09Theme/profiles.zcml:
    - change the title of the default profile, and name it "Andreas09
      Theme" (line 8).

- Skins folders were named an ugly way by the ZopeSkel template.

  Strip names of the folders that are in skins, their names are now:
  Andreas09Theme_custom_images, Andreas09Theme_custom_templates and
  Andreas09Theme_styles.

  In Products.Andreas09Theme/Products/Andreas09Theme/skins.zcml:
    - reflect changes made on the file system (lines 8, 10, 12).

  In Products.Andreas09Theme/Products/Andreas09Theme/profiles/default/skins.xml:
    - reflect changes made on the file system (text substitution in many
      lines).
