==============================
List of all available settings
==============================

PAGE_TEMPLATES
==================================

PAGE_TEMPLATES is a list of tuples that specifies the which templates
are available in the ``pages`` admin.  Templates should be assigned in
the following format::

    PAGE_TEMPLATES = (
        ('pages/nice.html', 'nice one'),
        ('pages/cool.html', 'cool one'),
    )



PAGE_PERMISSION
==================================

Set ``PAGE_PERMISSION`` to ``False`` if you do not wish to enable
advanced hierarchic permissions on your pages.

PAGE_TAGGING
==================================

Set ``PAGE_TAGGING`` to ``False`` if you do not wish to use the
``django-tagging`` application.

PAGE_TINYMCE
==================================

Set this to ``True`` if you wish to use the ``django-tinymce`` application.

PAGE_UNIQUE_SLUG_REQUIRED
==================================

Set ``PAGE_UNIQUE_SLUG_REQUIRED`` to ``True`` to enforce unique slug names
for all pages.

PAGE_CONTENT_REVISION
==================================

Set ``PAGE_CONTENT_REVISION`` to ``False`` to disable the recording of
pages revision information in the database

PAGE_LANGUAGES
==================================

A list tuples that defines the languages that pages can be translated into::

    gettext_noop = lambda s: s

    PAGE_LANGUAGES = (
        ('zh-cn', gettext_noop('Chinese Simplified')),
        ('fr-ch', gettext_noop('Swiss french')),
        ('en-us', gettext_noop('US English')),
    )


PAGE_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE
==================================

Defines which language should be used by default.  If
``PAGE_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE`` not specified, then project's
``settings.LANGUAGE_CODE`` is used

PAGE_LANGUAGE_MAPPING
==================================

PAGE_LANGUAGE_MAPPING should be assigned a function that takes
the language code of the incoming browser request as an argument.

This function maps the incoming client language code to another language code,
presumably one for which you are managing trough the CMS.

This is most useful if your project only has one set of translation strings
for a language like Chinese, which has several variants like ``zh-cn``, ``zh-tw``, ``zh-hk``, etc.
You don't have the ressources to a real translation for every variant.

`PAGE_LANGUAGE_MAPPING` help you to server the same Chinese translation to all those Chinese variants,
not just those with the exact ``zh-cn`` locale.

Enable that behavior here by assigning the following function to the
``PAGE_LANGUAGE_MAPPING`` variable::

     def language_mapping(lang):
         if lang.startswith('zh'):
             return 'zh-cn'
         return lang
    PAGE_LANGUAGE_MAPPING = language_mapping

SITE_ID
==================================

Set SITE_ID to the id of the default ``Site`` instance to be used on
installations where content from a single installation is servedÂ on
multiple domains via the ``django.contrib.sites`` framework.

PAGE_USE_SITE_ID
==================================

Set PAGE_USE_SITE_ID to ``True`` to make use of the ``django.contrib.sites``
framework

PAGE_USE_LANGUAGE_PREFIX
==================================

Set PAGE_USE_LANGUAGE_PREFIX to ``True`` to make the ``get_absolute_url``
method to prefix the URLs with the language code

PAGE_CONTENT_REVISION_EXCLUDE_LIST
==================================

Assign a list of placeholders to PAGE_CONTENT_REVISION_EXCLUDE_LIST
to exclude them from the revision process.

PAGE_SANITIZE_USER_INPUT
==================================

Set ``PAGE_SANITIZE_USER_INPUT`` to ``True`` to sanitize the user input with
``html5lib``


PAGES_MEDIA_URL
==================================

URL that handles pages media and uses <MEDIA_ROOT>/pages by default.

PAGE_HIDE_ROOT_SLUG
==================================

Hide the slug's of the first root page ie: ``/home/`` becomes ``/``

PAGE_SHOW_START_DATE
==================================

Show the publication start date field in the admin.  Allows for future dating
Changing the ``PAGE_SHOW_START_DATE``  from ``True`` to ``False``
after adding data could cause some weirdness.  If you must do this, you
should update your database to correct any future dated pages.

PAGE_SHOW_END_DATE
==================================

Show the publication end date field in the admin, allows for page expiration
Changing ``PAGE_SHOW_END_DATE`` from ``True`` to ``False`` after adding
data could cause some weirdness.  If you must do this, you should update
your database and null any pages with ``publication_end_date`` set.

PAGE_CONNECTED_MODELS
==================================

``PAGE_CONNECTED_MODELS`` allows you to specify a model and form for this
model into your settings to get an automatic form to create
and directly link a new instance of this model with your page in the admin::

    PAGE_CONNECTED_MODELS = [
        {'model':'documents.models.Document',
            'form':'documents.models.DocumentForm'},
    ]

.. note::

PAGE_LINK_FILTER
==================================

The page link filter enable a output filter on you content links. The goal
is to transform special page classes into real links at the last moment.
This ensure that even if you move a page within the CMS, the URLs pointing on it
will remain correct.

PAGE_EXTRA_CONTEXT
==================================

This setting is a function that can be defined if you need to pass extra
context data to the pages templates.
