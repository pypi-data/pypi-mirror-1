        =================
        
        The recipe supports the following options:
        
        .. Note to recipe author!
        ----------------------
        For each option the recipe uses you shoud include a description
        about the purpose of the option, the format and semantics of the
        values it accepts, whether it is mandatory or optional and what the
        default value is if it is omitted.
        
        option
        Description for ``option``...
        Option is here to identify which option will be the concatenated
        
        target
        Description for ``target``...
        Target is the target part that will receive the concatenated option from different parts
        
        parts
        Description for ``parts``...
        Part is the list of different parts from which the option will be concatenated
        
        
        Example usage
        =============
        
        .. Note to recipe author!
        ----------------------
        zc.buildout provides a nice testing environment which makes it
        relatively easy to write doctests that both demonstrate the use of
        the recipe and test it.
        You can find examples of recipe doctests from the PyPI, e.g.
        
        http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.recipe.egg
        
        The PyPI page for zc.buildout contains documentation about the test
        environment.
        
        http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout#testing-support
        
        Below is a skeleton doctest that you can start with when building
        your own tests.
        
        We'll start by creating a buildout that uses the recipe::
        
        >>> write('buildout.cfg',
        ... """
        ... [buildout]
        ... parts = test1
        ...
        ... [test1]
        ... recipe = my.macro.concat
        ... option = %(foo)s
        ... target = %(bar)s
        ... parts = test2
        ...         test3
        ... [test2]
        ... myconfig = be smart
        ... [test3]
        ... myconfig = dont worry
        ... [test4]
        ... myconfig =
        ... """ % { 'foo' : 'myconfig', 'bar' : 'test4'})
        
        Running the buildout gives us::
        
        >>> print 'start', system(buildout)
        start...
        Installing test1.
