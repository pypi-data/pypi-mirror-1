Description: 
        An enhancement to the SQLAlchemy package that provides a priority queue for
        dispatching database transactions and other sequential tasks; an access broker
        for conveniently managing database access, table setup, and transactions; and
        persistent dictionary, three-dimensional array, and graph objects.
        
        Everything is designed to run asynchronously under the Twisted framework using
        its deferred processing capabilities.
