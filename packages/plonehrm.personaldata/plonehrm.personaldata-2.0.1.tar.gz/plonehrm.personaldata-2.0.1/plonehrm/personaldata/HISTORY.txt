  [maurits+mike]

- Moved this code to Products.plonehrm.browser [jladage]

- Added age function to utils.py.  Use that in the browser view.
  Added some failing tests for Mike to fix. :-)  [maurits]

- Moved notifications/utils.py to utils.py in the main folder as it
  will not only be used in the notifications.  If this breaks imports
  for you, contact me.  [maurits]
