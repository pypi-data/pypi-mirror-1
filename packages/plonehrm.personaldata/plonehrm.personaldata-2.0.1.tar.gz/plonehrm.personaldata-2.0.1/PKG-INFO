Description: Personal data for Plone HRM
        ===========================
        
        This package adds extended personal data for Employees in Plone HRM.
        For more info see the Products.plonehrm package.
        
        Note: this package is going to be removed.  It has been integrated in
        Products.plonehrm itself.
        
        This is a stripped 2.0 release for use with Products.plonehrm 2.0;
        this version is needed for migration only.
        
        Any future 1.0.x releases will be bug fix releases for use with
        Products.plonehrm 1.0.

        ------------------
        
        - Removed the setting of the viewlets in the plonehrm_properties to
        the setuphandlers in Products.plonehrm, where we only set the order
        once.  [maurits+markvl]
        
        
        2.0 (2009-04-16)
        ----------------
        
        - Removed a lot of code as we will get rid of this package entirely.

        - Moved this code to Products.plonehrm.browser [jladage]
        
        - Added age function to utils.py.  Use that in the browser view.
        Added some failing tests for Mike to fix. :-)  [maurits]
        
        - Moved notifications/utils.py to utils.py in the main folder as it
        will not only be used in the notifications.  If this breaks imports
        for you, contact me.  [maurits]
        
        - Use collective.autopermission to register permissions.

        whose birthday is at a leap day (29 February).  [maurits+mike]

        ----------------
        
        - Do not do the hrm notification checks when the checks have been
        switched off in our control panel.  [maurits]
        
        - Get the warning period for the birthday check from the
        plonehrm_properties panel.  [maurits]
