Personal data for Plone HRM
===========================

This package adds extended personal data for Employees in Plone HRM.
For more info see the Products.plonehrm package.

Note: this package is going to be removed.  It has been integrated in
Products.plonehrm itself.  Any future 1.0.x releases will be bug fix
releases for use with Products.plonehrm 1.0.  There will be a stripped
2.0 release for use with Products.plonehrm 2.0; that version will be
needed for migration only.
