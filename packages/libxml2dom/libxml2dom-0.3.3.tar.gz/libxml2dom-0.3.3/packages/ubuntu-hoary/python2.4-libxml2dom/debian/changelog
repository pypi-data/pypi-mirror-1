libxml2dom (0.3-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Imposed much stricter tests on strings used with the
    libxml2dom API. Strings given as arguments to methods
    and functions must now only contain ASCII characters;
    any other character data must be provided as Unicode
    objects. This change fixes various issues with XPath
    expressions, and quite probably various other things.
  * Fixed parentNode on Document objects (which caused
    xml.dom.ext.PrettyPrint to crash).
  * Added some support for the doctype attribute and related
    information.
  * libxml2dom is now licensed under the LGPL - see
    docs/COPYING.txt for details.
