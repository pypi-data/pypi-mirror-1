Filter Functions
================

Filters are a powerful feature of Jinja taken from django which probably took
it from UNIX. The idea is that you "pipe" a value through some filters to
do something with it. For example convert it to upper case, escape it or
replace a substring.

Jinja comes with some builtin filters explained in the `designer documentation`_.

Writing Filters
===============

A filter basically is a factory function, a function that returns another
function. We do this because filters can get an unlimited amount of positional
arguments and aditionally should gain access to the environment, context and
piped value. A simple filter looks like this:

.. sourcecode:: python

    def do_join(d=u''):
        def wrapped(env, context, value):
            tmp = []
            for item in value:
                tmp.append(env.to_unicode(item))
            return d.join(tmp)
        return wrapped

Now you have to register that filter on an environment:

.. sourcecode:: python

    env.filters['join'] = do_join

In fact this filter is already bundled so you won't see any effect. But it
should explain how such a filter looks like. The template designer can just
trigger the outer code (i.e. call `join` with or without arguments). The
returned function is then processed by the jinja template engine once all
filters are created.

If you want to create filters that just operate on a string (in fact unicode
objects) you can use the `stringfilter` decorator:

.. sourcecode:: python

    from jinja.filters import stringfilter

    @stringfilter
    def do_strip(value):
        return value.strip()

The wrapped function is created internally by the decorator, any positional
arguments are forwarded to the filter function. The first argument is always
the value already converted into a string.
