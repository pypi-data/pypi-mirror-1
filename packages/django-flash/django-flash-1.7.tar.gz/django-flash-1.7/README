Django-Flash
------------

Django-Flash is a simple Django extension that provides support for Rails-like
flash messages.

The flash is a temporary storage mechanism that looks like a Python dictionary,
so you can store values associated with keys and later retrieve them.  It has
one special property: by default, values stored into the flash during the
processing of a request will be available during the processing of the
immediately following request. Once that second request has been processed,
those values are removed automatically from the flash.

This is an open source project licenced under the terms of the BSD License and
sponsored by Destaquenet Technology Solutions, a brazilian software development
and consultancy startup.
