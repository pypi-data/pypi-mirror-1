Changelog
=========

Like any other piece of software, Django-flash is evolving at each release.
Here you can see the project progress:

**Version 1.4:**

* **Notice:** *breaks backward compatibility;*
* Now Django-flash works pretty much like the original `Ruby on Rails`_' flash;
* Several code optmizations;
* Several improvements on the test suite;

**Version 1.3.5:**

* Several documentation improvements;
* Improvements on source code comments and unit tests;

**Version 1.3.4:**

* Added Sphinx_-based documentation;
* Source code changed to improve the Pylint_ score;
* :mod:`djangoflash` module now have a ``__version__`` property, which is
  very useful when you need to know what version of the Django-flash is
  installed in your machine;

**Version 1.3.3:**

* *Critical Bug Fixed*: Django-flash creates several useless session
  entries when the cookie support in user's browser is disabled;
* Small improvements on unit tests; 

**Version 1.3.2:**

* Small fixes;

**Version 1.3.1:**

* Added some sanity checks;

**Version 1.3:**

* **Notice:** *breaks backward compatibility;*
* Django-flash now controls the expiration of flash-scoped values
  individually, which means that only expired values are removed from the
  session (and not the whole flash context);
* Unit testing code was completely rewritten and now a real Django
  application is used in integration tests;
* Huge source code review to make it easier to read and to assure the use
  of Python conventions;
* Project renamed to **django-flash** (it was previously called
  **djangoflash**, without the hyphen);

**Version 1.2:**

* **Notice:** *breaks backward compatibility;*
* Improvements on the test comments;
* Now the flash scope works pretty much like a :class:`dict`, although
  still there's no value-based expiration (the whole flash scope expires at
  the end of the request).

**Version 1.1:**

* Now using SetupTools_ to make the project easier to distribute;

**Version 1.0:**

* First (very simple) version;
