Description: Test-Runner Recipe
        ==================
        
        This recipe generates zope.testing test-runenr scripts for testing a
        collection of eggs.  The eggs must already be installed (using the
        zc.recipe.egg recipe)
        
        The test-runner recipe has 2 options:
        
        - The eggs option takes the names of the eggs to be
        tested.  These are not installed by the recipe. They must be
        installed by some other recipe (or using the buildout develop
        option).  The distributions are in the form os setuptools
        requirements.  Multiple distributions must be listed on separate
        lines. This option is required.
        
        - The script option gives the name of the script to generate, in the
        buildout bin directory.  Of the option isn't used, the part name
        will be used.
        
        
        To do
        -----
        
        - Don't require eggs to be installed by the egg recipe.  Go ahead
        and try to install them.
        
        - Let the egg recipe do more of the heavy lifting internally.
        
        - Support specifying testrunner defaults (e.g. verbosity, test file
        patterns, etc.)
