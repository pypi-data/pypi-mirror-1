# This code *has* to be run before PoiTracker is imported as it uses
# the validator we are registering here by importing a module.  That
# means for instance that putting it in the initialize method is too
# late as content.PoiTracker is already imported when loading the
# configure.zcml.

# The Poi validator was copied to DataGridField 1.6 beta 3 so it may
# already be registered.  In that case we do not care which of the two
# validators is used.  The plan is to remove the validator from Poi
# when DataGridField 1.6 is widely available.  No imports here are
# needed in that case as DataGridField then takes care of that.
