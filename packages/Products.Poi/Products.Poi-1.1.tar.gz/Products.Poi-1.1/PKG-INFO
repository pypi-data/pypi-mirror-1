Description: Poi: A friendly issue tracker
        =============================
        
        by Martin Aspeli <optilude@gmx.net>
        Released under the GNU General Public License, version 2
        
        Poi is an issue tracker product for Plone. It has three overarching aims:
        
        - Work with, not against Plone.
        
        - Be simple and attractive whilst providing the most commonly needed issue
        tracking functionality.
        
        - Optionally integrate with the PloneSoftwareCenter to allow
        individual products to have their own issue trackers
        
        Poi is not and will not be a track-anything-and-everything tracker, a help desk
        product or anything else. If Poi is too simple for your needs, you may want to
        look at something like PloneCollectorNG.
        
        Feedback is very welcome.
        
        Please submit any bugs or feature requests to at:
        
        http://plone.org/products/poi/issues
        
        (Yes, this is a Poi tracker). Please do search the tracker first, so we can
        avoid unnecessary duplicates.
        
        See http://plone.org/products/poi for the latest release and the development
        roadmap.
        
        
        Using HTML/kupu and other markups for issue text:
        -------------------------------------------------
        
        **Please see notes about migration below!**
        
        Before version 1.0b2 Poi used to support kupu/rich text fields with HTML in the
        issue and response body. This was removed in favour of "intelligenttext", a
        plain-text markup that preserves whitespace and makes links clickable.
        
        This was found to work very well on plone.org and for the type of simple
        trackers that Poi was intended for. However, a lot of users wanted kupu back.
        
        To get kupu back, you will need to edit Poi/config.py::
        
        ISSUE_MIME_TYPES = ('text/x-web-intelligent', 'text/html')
        DEFAULT_ISSUE_MIME_TYPE = 'text/html'
        
        You may also need to re-install Poi, and perform an Archetypes schema update,
        by going to archetypes_tool, and the Schema Update tab in the ZMI.
        
        Please note two **very important** things:
        
        - If you upgrade Poi, you're likely to have to make this change again!
        
        - If you have issue text fields, and you have contentmigration installed, and
        text/html is not in the list of available MIME types above, then a migration
        will be run which will turn all your HTML fields into plain text! If this
        happens to you by accident - don't complain, you should've had a backup :)
        
        
        Installation and dependencies
        -----------------------------
        
        Poi requires:
        
        - Plone:
        2.5+ on Zope 2.9
        OR
        3.0+ on Zope 2.10
        - DataGridField (*)
        - AddRemoveWidget
        
        - intelligenttext (but this is installed by default in Plone 3)
        Note: when going from Plone 2.5 to 3.0, please first uninstall
        intelligenttext, then create a new instance with Plone 3.  Then
        run the portal_migration, which will install the new
        plone.intelligenttext library for you.
        
        - For migration from versions before 1.0b2, contentmigration is required.
        
        - For PloneSoftwareCenter integration, PloneSoftwareCenter is
        required.  See http://plone.org/products/plonesoftwarecenter
        Tested on Plone 2.5 with: PloneSoftwareCenter-1.0-RC.tgz
        Tested on Plone 3.0 with: PloneSoftwareCenter-1.5-alpha1.tar.gz
        
        (*) NOTE: Before version 1.0 beta 2, ArchAddOn was required instead of
        DataGridField.  Also note that PloneSoftwareCenter does required
        ArchAddOn.
        
        For new installations, install using Add/Remove Products as normal. If you want
        PloneSoftwareCenter configuration to be automatically configured, install PSC
        *first*.
        
        
        Upgrading
        ---------
        
        If you had a version prior to 1.0 beta 2 installed, you must run
        migrations.  This is automatic, but you need to install the
        'contentmigration' product. This can be found at
        
        https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/contentmigration/trunk
        
        It is also bundled with the release tarball. Simply drop the
        'contentmigration' product into your Products/ folder and re-install
        Poi from the Add/Remove Products control panel or
        portal_quickinstaller in the ZMI.
        
        After any upgrade (and after you have run migrations!), run an
        Archetypes schema update, by going to 'archetype_tool' in the ZMI,
        selecting the 'Update Schema' tab, selecting all the 'Poi.*' types,
        and clicking 'Update schema'. It's probably a good idea to choose 'All
        objects' from the drop-down as well, although this will take slightly
        longer.
        
        If you get errors about things being 'Missing', try to update your catalog,
        by going to portal_catalog in the ZMI, clicking the Advanced tab, and then
        the 'Update catalog' button.
        
        If you do not have any old Poi trackers around, you do not need to run
        migrations.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Add a Tracker, and use the "state" menu to open it for submissions.
        
        The tracker front pages allows you to browse for issues by release,
        state or area, as well as search for issues. Note that if you are not
        tracking software releases, you can leave the list of "releases"
        empty, and organisation by release will be turned off. The fields for
        areas and issue types come pre-configured with simple values that
        presume you are tracking software bugs.  You can change these to
        whatever you want.
        
        Once you have set up the tracker, add Issues inside, and Responses
        inside Issues. Anyone can add responses to issues with the default
        workflow. Responses from tracker managers (as configured on the root
        tracker object) and the original submitter are colour coded to make
        them easier to pick out. When adding a response as a tracker manager,
        you can change the state, importance or assignment of an issue.
        
        If email notification is enabled in the root tracker object, managers
        will get an email when there are new issues and responses, optionally
        via a mailing list. Issue submittes will also get emails upon issue
        responses. Additionally, when an issue is marked as "resolved" by a
        tracker manager, the submitter will receive an email asking him or her
        to mark the issue as confirmed closed.
        
        To use with the PloneSoftwareCenter, install PSC and *then* install
        Poi. This will ensure PoiPscTracker is added to the list of allowed
        content types in portal_types/PSCProject. You can then add Trackers
        inside a project in the software center. The trackers will function in
        the same way as regular trackers, but will use releases from the
        software center project instead of a manually defined list.

        [Per Erik Strandberg, maurits]
        
        
        Poi 1.1 rc 2 - Released December 5, 2007
        --------------------------------------
        
        - Add our indexes to the catalog with some code in AppInstall.py.
        Doing it there instead of in profiles/default/catalog.xml like
        previously means we do not need to reindex those indexes after
        every reinstall.
        [maurits]

        [Espen Moe-Nilssen]
        
        - Fix i18n of email sending:
        - Improve sending of emails with non-ascii character sets (mostly
        accented characters).
        - Use portal property email_charset for email sending if available.
        - Mime encode the subject of emails.
        Fixes http://plone.org/products/poi/issues/146
        [maurits, Stefano Deponti]
        
        - Register our skin layer for all skins instead of just for Plone
        Default.
        [maurits]
        
        
        Poi 1.1 beta 1 - Released Movember 19, 2007
        -----------------------------------------
        
        - This release introduces Plone 3.0 compatibility while keeping
        compatibility with Plone 2.5.
        [Alexander Limi and Maurits van Rees]
        
        - Link detection.  Trackers now have an svnUrl field.  For
        example, if your product is hosted in the Plone collective you
        can set this field to
        ``http://dev.plone.org/collective/changeset/%(rev)s``.  Then you
        can type 'r42' in an issue/response (any intelligenttext field)
        and get a link to that changeset.
        [Daniel Nouri]
        
        - Advanced issue search form now has a way to search for issues
        that match *all* tags, not only any, which helps when you're
        working a lot with tags.
        [Daniel Nouri]
        
        - Added a log-view for Poi trackers. This view renders a report on
        the most recent additions to the tracker; as such it will be
        similar to what is sent out as e-mail notifications.
        [Malthe Borch]
        
        - Cleanup of translations.
        [Maurits van Rees]
        
        - Loads of small bug fixes.
        [Maurits van Rees and others]
        
        
        Poi 1.0 - (never officially released)
        -----------------------------------
        
        - initial version.
