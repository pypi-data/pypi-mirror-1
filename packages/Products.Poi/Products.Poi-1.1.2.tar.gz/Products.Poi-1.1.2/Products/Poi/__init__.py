# There are three ways to inject custom code here:
#
#   - To set global configuration variables, create a file AppConfig.py.
#       This will be imported in config.py, which in turn is imported in
#       each generated class and in this file.
#   - To perform custom initialisation after types have been registered,
#       use the protected code section at the bottom of initialize().
#   - To register a customisation policy, create a file CustomizationPolicy.py
#       with a method register(context) to register the policy.

# This code *has* to be run before PoiTracker is imported as it uses
# the validator we are registering here by importing a module.  That
# means for instance that putting it in the initialize method is too
# late as content.PoiTracker is already imported when loading the
# configure.zcml.

# The Poi validator was copied to DataGridField 1.6 beta 3 so it may
# already be registered.  In that case we do not care which of the two
# validators is used.  The plan is to remove the validator from Poi
# when DataGridField 1.6 is widely available.  No imports here are
# needed in that case as DataGridField then takes care of that.
