Poi 1.1 beta 1 - Released Movember 19, 2007
-----------------------------------------

- This release introduces Plone 3.0 compatibility while keeping
  compatibility with Plone 2.5.
  [Alexander Limi and Maurits van Rees]

- Link detection.  Trackers now have an svnUrl field.  For
  example, if your product is hosted in the Plone collective you
  can set this field to
  ``http://dev.plone.org/collective/changeset/%(rev)s``.  Then you
  can type 'r42' in an issue/response (any intelligenttext field)
  and get a link to that changeset.
  [Daniel Nouri]

- Advanced issue search form now has a way to search for issues
  that match *all* tags, not only any, which helps when you're
  working a lot with tags.
  [Daniel Nouri]

- Added a log-view for Poi trackers. This view renders a report on
  the most recent additions to the tracker; as such it will be
  similar to what is sent out as e-mail notifications.
  [Malthe Borch]

- Cleanup of translations.
  [Maurits van Rees]

- Loads of small bug fixes.
  [Maurits van Rees and others]
