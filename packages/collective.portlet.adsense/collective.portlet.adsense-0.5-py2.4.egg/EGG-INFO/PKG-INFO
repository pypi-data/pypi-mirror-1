        ==========================
        
        Portlet AdSense allows to easily insert Google AdSense code in a Plone site
        using a dedicated portlet.
        
        It also provides configuration options to:
        use a pre-built Google AdSense slot code
        customize Ad colors
        customize PSA behaviour
        set test mode on
        
        Requirements

        * plone 3.x
        
        Release notes
        ========================

        Usage notes
        ========================
        
        AdSense code and Size are always mandatory
        AdSense slot code is optional; if an ad sense slot code is used its size and format should match the one
        choosen in the Size field.
        
        Custom colors will override other choices
        
        Alternate color and Alternate URL fields can be used to customize the Ad space behaviour in the event that Google is unable to serve targeted ads.
