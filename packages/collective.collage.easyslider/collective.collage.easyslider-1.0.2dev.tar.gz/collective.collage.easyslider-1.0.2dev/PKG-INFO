Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Integrates Css Globe Easy Slider (http://cssglobe.com/) into Collage.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        * Add ``collective.collage.easyslider`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
        
        [buildout]
        ...
        eggs =
        ...
        collective.collage.easyslider
        
        * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::
        
        [instance]
        recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
        ...
        zcml =
        collective.collage.easyslider
        
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
        
        $ ./bin/buildout
        
        You can skip the ZCML slug if you are using Plone 3.3 or if you are going to explicitly include
        the package from another package's configure.zcml file.
