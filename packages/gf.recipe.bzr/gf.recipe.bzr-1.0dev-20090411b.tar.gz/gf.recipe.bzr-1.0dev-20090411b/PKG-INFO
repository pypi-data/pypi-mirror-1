Description: ==============================
        gf.recipe.bzr buildout recipee
        ==============================
        
        This recipe can be used to get development checkouts from Bazaar repositories
        for zc.buildout.
        
        **IMPORTANT COMPATIBILITY CHANGE: SEE BELOW**

        =============
        
        Goals
        -----
        
        - Allow fetching eggs directly from bzr repositories.
        
        - The specified repositories are branched locally on the first buildout run. It
        is possible to use these local branches for development and make local
        changes. The local changes can be committed locally, and can be pushed back
        to the remote repository or to any other location.
        
        - When buildout is run again, the branches are updated (pulled) automatically
        from the remote location. If pulling causes conflicts, buildout continues
        gracefully, but it gives an error message to notify the user about the problem.
        The parent branch (pull) location remembered by bazaar will be
        used for pulling, so it is possible to change this any time from bzr, and
        the recipe will use the new location from that point on.
        
        - Local changes can be pushed back manually to the remote branches. This is
        not enforced and is in the responsibility of the user. The recipe does not
        do any checks at uninstall time, neither does it remove the local branches.
        Please note however that your changes will not propagate upstream, unless
        you do the necessary push.
        
        - Parameters are similar to those used with "infrae.subversion" and also
        compatible with the "bazaarrecipe" package.
        
        - With bzr-svn, the remote branch can also be an svn branch. So it actually can
        be used to branch off native svn repository branches as well (although,
        performance of updates and sanity checks may depend on bzr-svn's performance,
        thus infrae.subversion may provide faster operation for svn.)
        
        
        Compatibility changes
        ---------------------
        
        The default recipe is now doing a light repository checkup, as described in the goals.
        Important changes from recent versions:
        
        - On update, if "pull" is unsuccesful, the recipe will give an error with the
        bzr command output, but it will not cause buildout to stop with an error.
        The developer needs to look at this output to realize that the update has
        not took place.
        
        - There is no uninstall any more. The developer is no more enforced to commit
        an push her changes. Note that the branch will never be removed, thus
        the developer won't loose local changes in any way, unless she willingly
        deletes the branch.
        
        **The old behaviour is still available, in the "strict" recipe**::
        
        [bzr]
        recipe = gf.recipe.bzr#strict
        ...
        
        If you find problems using the recipe after an upgrade, please try to use
        the "strict" recipe.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Usage example::
        
        [bzr]
        recipe = gf.recipe.bzr
        urls =
        http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~kissbooth/kss.plugin.sdnd/trunk kss.plugin.sdnd
        http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~kissbooth/kss.plugin.livesearch/trunk kss.plugin.livesearch
        in_parts = False
        http_authentication = username:password
        
        This will ``bzr get`` the branches to ``bzr/kss.plugin.sdnd`` and
        ``bzr/kss.plugin.livesearch``.  Branches are pulled if buildout is called.
        Uninstall is protected, if there are local modifications, or modifications that
        are missing in the upstream, an error will be raised. In case you create a
        local bzr directory, make sure it has a push location, otherwise uninstall will
        fail.
        
        No directories are really removed on uninstall, this has the consequence that
        if the setup is changed, the local repositories will not follow it.
        
        The ``in_parts`` option
        """""""""""""""""""""""
        
        ``in_parts`` is by default false, which means the directory that holds the branches
        is created in the buildout root. This is the default mode as it is handy for
        development. If ``in_parts = True`` is specified, then the directory will be
        created in the parts directory (compatible with infrae.subversion).
        
        The ``http_authentication`` option
        """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
        
        If ``http authentication`` is specified as ``username:password``, it will be used for
        authenticating into http and https realms. This is rarely needed as ssh offers
        a more comfortable repository access, but it allows password protected http
        access that would not be easy (or possible at all) otherwise.
        
        The option is inactive with ``bzr+ssh://`` repository urls.
        
        The ``develop`` option
        """"""""""""""""""""""
        
        The branches fetched by the recipe are also installed as development eggs, by
        default. The ``develop = False`` option can be used to force the recipe not to
        develop the eggs. This can be useful, for example, to use buildout to update
        local read-only bazaar mirrors of an svn repository::
        
        [kukit.js]
        recipe = gf.recipe.bzr
        urls=
        https://codespeak.net/svn/kukit/kukit.js/trunk              trunk
        https://codespeak.net/svn/kukit/kukit.js/branch/1.2         1.2
        https://codespeak.net/svn/kukit/kukit.js/branch/1.4         1.4
        develop = False
        
        [kss.demo]
        recipe = gf.recipe.bzr
        urls=
        https://codespeak.net/svn/kukit/kss.demo/trunk              trunk
        https://codespeak.net/svn/kukit/kss.demo/branch/1.2         1.2
        https://codespeak.net/svn/kukit/kss.demo/branch/1.4         1.4
        develop = False
        
        
        Other configuration needed
        --------------------------
        
        In addition you also need to include the eggs you configured with the recipe,
        in the buildout section::
        
        [buildout]
        ...
        eggs =
        ...
        kss.plugin.sdnd
        kss.plugin.livesearch
        
        
        
        Recent changes
        ==========================
        Changelog for gf.recipe.bzr
        
        (name of developer listed in brackets)
        
        gf.recipe.bzr - 1.0dev Unreleased
        
        - ...
        
        - **COMPATIBILITY CHANGE**. The recipe is changed
        to do much more relaxed checking. The original recipe
        is available as #strict, in an unchanged form.
        [ree]
        
        - Handle offline mode more correctly.
        Offline mode is still not detected during uninstalls,
        but it's handled correctly on updates.
        [Vladimir Iliev <vladimir.iliev@gmail.com>, ree]
        
        - Fix it to run on Windows
        [Vladimir Iliev <vladimir.iliev@gmail.com>]
        
        - Fix the url matching scheme for manually adding passwords
        via the http_authentication parameter
        [Vladimir Iliev <vladimir.iliev@gmail.com>]
        
        - Add "develop" option
        [ree]
        
        - Fix usage of "--remember" for pull locations
        at initial checkout.
        [ree]
        
        - Properly fix updates, and uninstall checks.
        Uninstall forces to push all pending changes,
        but still does not physically delete directories.
        [ree]
        
        - Initial package structure.
