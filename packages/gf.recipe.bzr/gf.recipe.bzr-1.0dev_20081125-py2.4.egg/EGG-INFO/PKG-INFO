Description: ==============================
        gf.recipe.bzr buildout recipee
        ==============================
        
        This recipe can be used to get development checkouts from Bazaar repositories
        for zc.buildout.
        
        Installation and Setup
        ======================
        
        Read INSTALL.txt
        
        
        Documentation
        =============
        
        Goals
        -----
        
        - Allow fetching eggs directly from bzr repositories.
        
        - The specified repositories are branched locally on the first buildout run. It
        is possible to use these local branches for development and make local
        changes. The local changes can be committed locally, and can be pushed back
        to the remote repository or to any other location.
        
        - When buildout is run again, the branches are updated (pulled) automatically
        from the remote location. If pulling would cause conflicts, buildout stops
        with an error. The parent branch (pull) location remembered by bazaar will be
        used for pulling, so it is possible to change this any time from bzr.
        
        - Local changes can be pushed back to the remote branches. This is also enforced:
        When buildout wants to uninstall the local branches, they are checked. If
        they contain uncommitted or unpushed local changes, buildout stops with an
        error. This forces developers to save local changes to upstream and avoids
        loosing local work.
        
        - When buildout checks if the branches contain local changes, the parent (pull)
        location and the push location, remembered by bazaar, are used (in this
        order). This makes it possible to switch existing branches during
        development, without changing the buildout configuration.
        
        - Parameters are similar to those used with "infrae.subversion" and also
        compatible with the "bazaarrecipe" package.
        
        - With bzr-svn, the remote branch can also be an svn branch. So it actually can
        be used to branch off native svn repository branches as well (although,
        performance of updates and sanity checks may depend on bzr-svn's performance,
        thus infrae.subversion may provide faster operation for svn.)
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Usage example::
        
        [bzr]
        recipe = gf.recipe.bzr
        urls =
        http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~kissbooth/kss.plugin.sdnd/trunk kss.plugin.sdnd
        http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~kissbooth/kss.plugin.livesearch/trunk kss.plugin.livesearch
        in_parts = False
        http_authentication = username:password
        
        This will ``bzr get`` the branches to ``bzr/kss.plugin.sdnd`` and
        ``bzr/kss.plugin.livesearch``.  Branches are pulled if buildout is called.
        Uninstall is protected, if there are local modifications, or modifications that
        are missing in the upstream, an error will be raised. In case you create a
        local bzr directory, make sure it has a push location, otherwise uninstall will
        fail.
        
        No directories are really removed on uninstall, this has the consequence that
        if the setup is changed, the local repositories will not follow it.
        
        The ``in_parts`` option
        """""""""""""""""""""""
        
        ``in_parts`` is by default false, which means the directory that holds the branches
        is created in the buildout root. This is the default mode as it is handy for
        development. If in_parts = True is specified, then the directory will be
        created in the parts directory (compatible with infrae.subversion).
        
        The ``http_authentication`` option
        """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
        
        If ``http authentication`` is specified as ``username:password``, it will be used for
        authenticating into http and https realms. This is rarely needed as ssh offers
        a more confortable repository access, but it allows password protected http
        access that would not be easy (or possible at all) otherwise.
        
        The option is inactive with ``bzr+ssh://`` repository urls.
        
        The ``develop`` option
        """"""""""""""""""""""
        
        The branches fetched by the recipe are also installed as development eggs, by
        default. The ``develop = False`` option can be used to force the recipe not to
        develop the eggs. This can be useful, for example, to use buildout to update
        local read-only bazaar mirrors of an svn repository::
        
        [kukit.js]
        recipe = gf.recipe.bzr
        urls=
        https://codespeak.net/svn/kukit/kukit.js/trunk              trunk
        https://codespeak.net/svn/kukit/kukit.js/branch/1.2         1.2
        https://codespeak.net/svn/kukit/kukit.js/branch/1.4         1.4
        develop = False
        
        [kss.demo]
        recipe = gf.recipe.bzr
        urls=
        https://codespeak.net/svn/kukit/kss.demo/trunk              trunk
        https://codespeak.net/svn/kukit/kss.demo/branch/1.2         1.2
        https://codespeak.net/svn/kukit/kss.demo/branch/1.4         1.4
        develop = False
        
        
        Offline mode is not supported for uninstalls
        """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
        
        Offline mode is *not* supported for uninstalls, because there seems
        to be no way of detecting during uninstall, if we are in offline mode.
        
        This means that if you run buildout in offline mode, and buildout decides that
        an uninstall is needed, the recipe will still attempt an online connection
        to the upstream repository. If this gets you into a deadlock, you need to
        run buildout in online mode, or remove your branches manually if you choose to
        resolve the situation by loosing all your local changes.
        
        
        Other configuration needed
        --------------------------
        
        In addition you also need to include the eggs you configured with the recipe,
        in the buildout section::
        
        [buildout]
        ...
        eggs =
        ...
        kss.plugin.sdnd
        kss.plugin.livesearch
