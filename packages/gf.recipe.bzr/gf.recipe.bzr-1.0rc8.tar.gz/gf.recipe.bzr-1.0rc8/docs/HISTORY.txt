      [sidnei]

    - Cleaned up the 'strict' recipe to reuse most of the 'default'
      recipe where possible, avoiding duplication.
      [sidnei]

      [sidnei]

gf.recipe.bzr - 1.0rc6 Released 2009-07-14

      [ree]

    - Add 'destination' option to use an arbitrary branch
      directory instead of the location relative to the
      buildout root (depending on the value of 'in_parts')
      [therve]

gf.recipe.bzr - 1.0rc5 Released 2009-06-22

    - release candidate rc4 skipped
      [ree]

gf.recipe.bzr - 1.0rc4 Unreleased

    - Add support for specifying 'shared-repo' and 'format', which is
      useful for branching inside a bzr branch and making it fast for
      subsequent large branches from the same repo, or 'rich-root'
      branches inside non-rich-root branches.
      [sidnei]

    - Use 'shell=true' to subprocess and then call just 'bzr' instead
      of 'bzr.bat'. The shell will figure out the extension for us.
      [sidnei]

    - Allow specifying a revisionspec for a branch in the url, using
      '@', just like in subversion.
      [sidnei]

gf.recipe.bzr - 1.0rc3 Released 2009-04-21

    - Fix a missing call to BZR that caused a breakage
      on Windows
      [ree]

gf.recipe.bzr - 1.0rc2 Released 2009-04-19

    - Change the working directory to the buildout root before
      get, to avoid possible errors when the current working 
      directory is inside a bazaar working tree.
      [ree]

gf.recipe.bzr - 1.0rc1 Released 2009-04-12

    - **COMPATIBILITY CHANGE**. The recipe is changed
      to do much more relaxed checking. The original recipe
      is available as #strict, in an unchanged form.
      [ree]

    - Handle offline mode more correctly.
      Offline mode is still not detected during uninstalls,
      but it's handled correctly on updates.
      [Vladimir Iliev <vladimir.iliev@gmail.com>, ree]

    - Fix it to run on Windows
      [Vladimir Iliev <vladimir.iliev@gmail.com>]

    - Fix the url matching scheme for manually adding passwords

      [Vladimir Iliev <vladimir.iliev@gmail.com>]

    - Add "develop" option
      [ree]

    - Fix usage of "--remember" for pull locations
      at initial checkout.
      [ree]

    - Properly fix updates, and uninstall checks.
      Uninstall forces to push all pending changes,
      but still does not physically delete directories.
      [ree]

    - Initial package structure.
      [ree]
