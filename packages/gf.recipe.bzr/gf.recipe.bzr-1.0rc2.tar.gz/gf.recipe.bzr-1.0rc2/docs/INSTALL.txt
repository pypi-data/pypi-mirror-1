gf.recipe.bzr Installation
==========================

The recipee has to be used wit zc.buildout. The package must be
installed as an egg to enable this.

If once the package will be released as an egg downloadable
with easy_install, buildout will be able to install it 
automatically when the recipee is used. However at the moment
there is no .egg download, so an alternate way needs to be used.

One way of using it at the moment is checking it out manually
into a "src" directory in the buildout root. Then tell buildout 
about it by adding these in the vuildout.cfg::

    [buildout]
    ...

    # Reference any eggs you are developing here, one per line
    # e.g.: develop = src/my.package
    develop =
        ...
        src/gf.recipe.bzr

Following this, you can use the recipee from your buildout
as described in README.txt.
