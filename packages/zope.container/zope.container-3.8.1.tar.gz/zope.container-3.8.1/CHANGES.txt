3.8.1 (2009-04-03)
------------------

- Fixed misspackaged 3.8.0


3.8.0 (2009-04-03)
------------------

- Change configure.zcml to not depend on zope.app.component.
  Fixes: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/348329

- Moved the declaration of ``IOrderedContainer.updateOrder``  to a new, basic
  ``IOrdered`` interface and let ``IOrderedContainer`` inherit it. This allows
  easier reuse of the declaration.

3.7.2 (2009-03-12)
------------------

- Fix: added missing ComponentLookupError, missing since revision 95429 and 
  missing in last release.

- Adapt to the move of IDefaultViewName from zope.component.interfaces
  to zope.publisher.interfaces.

- Add support for reserved names for containers. To specify reserved
  names for some container, you need to provide an adapter from the
  container to the ``zope.container.interfaces.IReservedNames`` interface.
  The default NameChooser is now also aware of reserved names.

3.7.1 (2009-02-05)
------------------

- Raise more "Pythonic" errors from ``__setitem__``, losing the dependency
  on ``zope.exceptions``:

  o ``zope.exceptions.DuplicationError`` -> ``KeyError``

  o ``zope.exceptions.UserError`` -> ``ValueError``

- Moved import of ``IBroken`` interface to use new ``zope.broken``
  package, which has no dependencies beyond ``zope.interface``.

- Made ``test`` part pull in the extra test requirements of this package.

- Split the ``z3c.recipe.compattest`` configuration out into a new file,
  ``compat.cfg``, to reduce the burden of doing standard unit tests.

- Stripped out bogus develop eggs from ``buildout.cfg``.

3.7.0 (2009-01-31)
------------------

- Split this package off ``zope.app.container``. This package is
  intended to have far less dependencies than ``zope.app.container``.

- This package also contains the container implementation that
  used to be in ``zope.app.folder``.
