** TODO **
==========

Before 3.0 final
----------------

- The chart generation should either work or should be removed properly,
  ideally it should generate a HTML page instead which has some nice bars

- Pin the release to exact final versions of the zope.* dependencies

- Figure out how to do a proper Windows installer release if that is still
  possible. At least the egg-based version should work OOTB (win eggs of all
  dependencies should be available)

- Update installation instructions to cover workingenv and zc.buildout, provide
  a default zc.buildout configuration

Long term todos
---------------

- Tests needs to be written for more than catalog.py

- Main i18ndude script needs to be refactored and fewer options.

- Assume a domain called "default" if the i18n:domain attribute is not present.
