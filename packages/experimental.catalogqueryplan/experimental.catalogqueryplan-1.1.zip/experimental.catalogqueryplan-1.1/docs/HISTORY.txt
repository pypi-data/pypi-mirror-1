Changelog
=========

1.1 - 2009-01-02
----------------

* Made the set monkeypatches temporary to avoid zc.relationship
  trying to persist the set methods.
  [tesdal]

1.0 - 2009-01-02
----------------

* Removed redundant intersections, added type checking to difference
  [tesdal]

* Add alternative weightedIntersection, and reuse BTree tests
  [tesdal]

* Don't monkeypatch intersection as zc.relationship will try
  to pickle the function.
  Added new ExtendedPathIndex code.
  [tesdal]

* Optimize UnIndex.apply_index internally, sort sets for AND,
  use multiunion for OR.
  [tesdal]

* Limit the number of if-statements in intersection,
  and added test for fastest way of finding max and min.
  [tesdal]

* Monkeypatch difference to handle big/tiny difference in Python
  This doesn't belong in queryplan, as it's only a BTree patch,
  and should be refactored out.
  [tesdal]

* Added performance tests.
  [tesdal]

* Fixed a bug with UnIndex return result missing index id
  [tesdal]

* Added tests for intersection, fixed a bug with empty second argument set
  [tesdal]

* Monkeypatch intersect to handle big/tiny intersects in Python
  [tesdal]

* Improved UnIndex query, to avoid redundant intersections
  [tesdal]

* Clarified LanguageIndex support. We are missing fallback support right now
  and now disable the optimization when fallback is enabled.
  [hannosch, mj]

0.9 - 2008-10-18
----------------

* Added support for LinguaPlone's LanguageIndex.
  [hannosch]

0.8 - 2008-09-03
----------------

* Let each index patch register itself with the ADVANCEDTYPES list.
  This should enable patching of other indexes as well, and remove
  the dependency on ExtendedPathIndex.
  [tesdal]

0.7 - 2008-08-22
----------------

* Check whether we're supposed to use daterangeindex
  at all before retrieving cached data.
  [tesdal]

0.6 - 2008-07-03
----------------

* Use a volatile instance variable to store the prioritymap.
  [mj]

0.5 - 2008/06/23
----------------

* DateRangeIndex shouldn't overwrite the semi-request passed into the 
  apply_index method.
  [mj]

0.4 - 2008/06/23
----------------

* DateRangeIndex now doesn't assume that REQUEST is available.
  [tesdal]

0.3
---

* Handle request being a dictionary.
  [tesdal]

0.3
---

* Refactored patches into multiple files.
  [tesdal]

* Dynamic query optimization based on result set analysis
  from queries against the same indexes.
