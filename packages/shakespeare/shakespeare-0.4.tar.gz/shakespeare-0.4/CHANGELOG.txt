v0.4: 2007-04-16
================

  * Annotation of texts (js-based in browser) (ticket:20, ticket:21)
    (<http://www.openshakespeare.org/2007/04/10/annotation-is-working/>)
  * Switch to unicode for internal string handling (resolves ticket:23: some
    texts breaking the viewer)
  * Add functional tests for the web interface (ticket:11)
  * Substantial improvements to speed of concordance (ticket:22)
    (<http://www.openshakespeare.org/2007/01/03/improvements-to-the-concordance/>)
  * Switch to genshi templates from kid
  * Switch to plain WSGI from cherrypy

Outstanding Issues
------------------

  * Annotation cannot handle long texts because of javascript performance
    issues


v0.3: 2006-10-04
================

  * Can now view mutiple texts side by side (ticket:15). See it in action at:
    <http://demo.openshakespeare.org/view?name=othello_gut_f+othello_gut>
  * Now include moby/bosak versions of shakespeare as well as gutenberg
    (ticket:10) (though more work remains to be done to process these versions
    to plaintext and html)
  * Fix bug whereby we were missing some of the available gutenberg texts 
    (ticket:18)
  * Install the shakespeare python package (ticket:16)
  * Move to py.test from unittest
  * New project website at <http://www.openshakespeare.org/>

Outstanding Issues
------------------

  * Several of the source texts (all of them Gutenberg folios) seem to 
    break the viewer due to kid (the templating system) complaining about about
    'not well-formed (invalid token) xml'. Any help in tracking this down would
    be greatly appreciated.


v0.2 2006-07-16
===============

  * Database backend with proper domain model (ticket:6)
  * Text snippets in concordance system and links through to source (ticket:12)
  * Sources document (ticket:5)
