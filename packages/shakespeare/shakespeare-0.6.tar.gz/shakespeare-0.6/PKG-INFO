        Introduction
        ************
        
        The Open Shakespeare package provides a full open set of shakespeare's works
        (often in multiple versions) along with ancillary material, a variety of tools
        and a python API.
        
        Specifically in addition to the works themselves (often in multiple versions)
        there is an introduction, a chronology, explanatory notes, a concordance and
        search facilities.
        
        All material is open source/open knowledge so that anyone can use, redistribute
        and reuse these materials freely. For exact details of the license under which
        this package is made available please see COPYING.txt.
        
        Open Shakespeare has been developed under the aegis of the Open Knowledge
        Foundation (http://www.okfn.org/).

        As a user:
        ==========
        
        1. Basic setup
        --------------
        
        To access most of the main features of Open Shakespeare you need a database.
        For this an other bits and bobs of configuration you will need a configuration
        file.
        
        You can make a config file as follows::
        
        paster make-config shakespeare {your-config.ini}
        
        Tweak the config file as appropriate and then setup the application::
        
        paster setup-app config.ini
        
        [TODO: this should be part of setup-app]
        
        Run::
        
        $ shakespeare-admin db init
        
        2. Extras
        ---------
        
        1. Search index. [TODO]
        
        2. You can start a web server to provide a easy-to-use web interface to the
        shakespeare material and facilities by doing::
        
        $ paster serve {your-config.ini}
        
        NB: {your-config.ini} should be replaced with the name of the config file you
        created earlier.
        
        
        As a developer:
        ===============
        
        0. Setup
        --------
        
        Follow the basic steps above put with an ini file named: development.ini
        
        NB: you'll probably want to change log levels to debug.
        
        1. Check out the administrative commands
        ----------------------------------------
        
        $ bin/shakespeare-admin help.
        
        2. Run the tests using either py.test of nosetests::
        ----------------------------------------------------
        
        $ nosetests shakespeare
