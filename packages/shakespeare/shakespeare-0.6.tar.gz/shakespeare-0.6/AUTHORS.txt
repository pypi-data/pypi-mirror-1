Shakespeare Texts
=================

Obviously the primary author of these texts is William Shakespeare himself.

The exact source url for a given text is usually provided in the accompanying
notes. Below is a full list of all of the different locations from which texts
were sourced.

1. Project Gutenberg:

     http://www.gutenberg.org/
   
   Project Gutenberg provides multiple versions of each Shakespeare text. Some
   of these are copyrighted and some are not. For this project we have **only
   used texts that were stated to be in the public domain.** We have also
   removed any mention of Project Gutenberg from the texts so as to avoid any
   obligations that would result thereof under the Project Gutenberg license.
   
   The Gutenberg 'standard' edition appears to be based on the Globe Edition
   (1866) of Clark and Wright. The folio versions contain the following source
   information:

   > the spelling errors introduced by the printers of the time have

   > As I understand it, the printers often ran out of certain words
   > or letters they had often packed into a "cliche". . .this is the
   > original meaning of the term cliche. . .and thus, being unwilling
   > to unpack the cliches, and thus you will see some substitutions
   > that look very odd. . .such as the exchanges of u for v, v for u,
   > above. . .and you may wonder why they did it this way, presuming
   > Shakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner. . . .
   > 
   > The answer is that they MAY have packed "liue" into a cliche at a
   > time when they were out of "v"'s. . .possibly having used "vv" in
   > place of some "w"'s, etc.  This was a common practice of the day,
   > as print was still quite expensive, and they didn't want to spend
   > more on a wider selection of characters than they had to.
   > 
   > You will find a lot of these kinds of "errors" in this text, as I
   > have mentioned in other times and places, many "scholars" have an
   > extreme attachment to these errors, and many have accorded them a
   > very high place in the "canon" of Shakespeare.  My father read an
   > assortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University
   > in England for several months in a glass room constructed for the
   > purpose.  To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available
   > . . .in great detail. . .and determined from the various changes,
   > that Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a
   > variety of errors we credit him for, even though he was in/famous
   > for signing his name with several different spellings.

2. Bosak/Moby Shakespeare

     http://www.ibiblio.org/xml/examples/shakespeare/

   These marked up versions of Shakespeare were produced by Jon Bosak from
   texts provided by Moby Lexical tools. Each text contains the following
   copyright notice:

   > <P>
   > Text placed in the public domain by Moby Lexical Tools, 1992.
   > </P>
   > <P>SGML markup by Jon Bosak, 1992-1994.</P>
   > <P>XML version by Jon Bosak, 1996-1998.</P>
   > <P>
   > This work may be freely copied and distributed worldwide.
   > </P>

   According to various reports on the web (e.g. [palomar], [oss_moby_source])
   the Moby Edition is based on the Globe Edition (1866) of Clark and Wright.

   Note that while the text itself is in the public domain the markup is not.
   According to the [bosak release notes]:

   > While the text has been in the public domain since 1992, the status of the
   > markup hasn't been clear. For purposes of legal simplicity (I think), I'm
   > now asserting copyright over the markup to discourage the circulation of
   > variant versions while still allowing free distribution. Each play now
   > includes the following notice:

   > ASCII text placed in the public domain by Moby Lexical Tools, 1992.  SGML
   > markup by Jon Bosak, 1992-1994.  XML version by Jon Bosak, 1996-1999.  The
   > XML markup in this version is Copyright Â© 1999 Jon Bosak. This work may
   > freely be distributed on condition that it not be modified or altered in
   > any way.
