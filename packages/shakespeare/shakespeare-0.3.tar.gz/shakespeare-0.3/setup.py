The Open Shakespeare package provides a full open set of shakespeare's works
(often in multiple versions) along with ancillary material, a variety of tools
and a python API.

Specifically in addition to the works themselves (often in multiple versions)
there is an introduction, a chronology, explanatory notes, a concordance and
search facilities.

All material is open source/open knowledge so that anyone can use, redistribute
and reuse these materials freely. For exact details of the license under which
this package is made available please see COPYING.txt.

Open Shakespeare has been developed under the aegis of the Open Knowledge
Foundation (http://www.okfn.org/).
