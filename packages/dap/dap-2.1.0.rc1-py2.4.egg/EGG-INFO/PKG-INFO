Description: The Data Access Protocol (DAP) is a data transmission protocol designed
        specifically for science data. The protocol relies on the widely used HTTP
        and MIME standards, and provides data types to accommodate gridded data,
        relational data, and time series, as well as allowing users to define their
        own data types.
        
        This module implements a DAP client that can access remote datasets stored
        in DAP servers. The client downloads metadata describing the datasets, and
        builds array-like objects that act as proxies for the data. These objects
        download the data from the server transparently when necessary.
        
        The module also implements a DAP server, able to serve data from different
        formats through a plugin architecture. The server is implemented as a WSGI
        application, and can be run on a variety of servers: as a CGI script; with
        Twisted and mod_python; or even as a ISAPI extension under IIS; for
        example.
