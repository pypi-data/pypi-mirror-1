2.2.6.4 (Wed Apr 30 13:30:55 GMT 2008)
	Fixed bug in that caused the HTML response to fail with recent versions
	of Paste. The ``httpexceptions`` WSGI middleware is no longer required.

2.2.6.3 (Fri Jan  4 21:12:56 GMT 2008)
    Fixed bug in WSGI application, closing the handler properly.

2.2.6.2 (Mon Dec 10 19:30:11 GMT 2007)
    Fixed bug in the DAS parser, found by Charles Carleton, with an overflow
    on Int32s bigger than Python's integers. The cast to long inside the
    ``array.array`` object would cause the overflow.

2.2.6.1 (Mon Nov  5 15:30:47 GMT 2007)
    Added timeout option to the client.    
    Removed implicit genexp in client to make code compatible with
    Python 2.3.

2.2.6 (Thu Sep 13 13:10:30 GMT 2007)
    Fixed concurrency issues on the server.

2.2.5.10 (Thu Jul 19 11:57:55 GMT 2007)
    Fixed a small bug in the client where the cache information was
    not being used to retrieve the DAS and the DDS (only the DODS
    response) -- thanks to Darren Hardy <dhardy@bren.ucsb.edu>.

    Brian Granger made the ArrayType object more compatible with
    numpy arrays.

2.2.5.9 (Tue Apr 10 20:05:09 GMT 2007)
    Added proper support in the client for the "Alias" attribute type.

2.2.5.8
    Fixed bug in the evaluation of values from DAS. Bytes are decoded
    assuming unsigned values (0:255) instead of signed (-128:127).

2.2.5.7
    Values from the DAS are now evaluated using the right precision. This
    means missing_values defined as Float32, eg, will have the same
    representation as the data.

2.2.5.6
    Moved DAP proxy to the main tree (``dap.wsgi.proxy``).

    When opening local files, client tries to unwrap arrayterators.

2.2.5.5
    Fixed bug in client when requesting data with step > 1.

    DAS parser now returns single attributes as simple values,
    instead of a list of only one element.

    DAS parser add attributes to maps from a variable of the same
    name from the root dataset. Eg, a grid with a map ``latitude``
    will have its attributes copied from a variable ``latitude``
    in the main dataset, if it exists and it the map has no attributes.

2.2.5.4
    Fixed bug when generating the DAS response from attributes
    contained in 0D numpy arrays.

    Additional parameters in the Paste Deploy configuration file
    are now being passed to the ``environ`` dict.

    WSGI app now honors ``x-wsgiorg.throw_errors`` specification from
    http://wsgi.org/wsgi/Specifications/throw_errors.
    
2.2.5.3
    Fixed bug where the requested variables were being passed unquoted
    in the response from ``dap.helper.parse_querystring``.
    
2.2.5.2
    Fixed another small bug in xdr.py when encoding numpy arrays
    of strings.

2.2.5.1
    Fixed a small bug in the XDR encoding that only appeared in the
    SCGI server, thanks to Dallas Masters.

2.2.5
    Fixed directory listing in ``DapServerApplication``: output was
    being returned as a string instead of a list, making the WSGI server
    iterate over each character.

    Changed server (``dap.wsgi.application.SimpleApplication``) to
    ignore exceptions derived from ``paste.httpexceptions.HTTPException``.
    This allows the HTML response to raise a ``HTTPSeeOther`` exception,
    redirecting the user to the corresponding ASCII response after a
    POST.

    Made server **much** faster by using numpy's ``array.astype`` instead
    of Python's native ``array.array``. This makes it at least 10x faster
    for big datasets.

2.2.4
    Changes mostly related to plugin development: added a namespace
    for the packages; made ``parse_querystring()`` return Python slices
    instead of strings.

    Changed the DAS response to work with GrADS by ommiting attributes
    from array and maps in grids.

    Fixed USER_AGENT that was not being passed to httplib2.

2.2.3
    Moved server template to ``dap/wsgi/``.

    Created template for writing new plugins in ``dap/plugins/``.

2.2.2
    Empty directories from paster template where not being included.
    Added stub files in MANIFEST.in to include them.

2.2.1
    Fixed small bug when deepcopying dtypes (data attribute was not
    begin copied).

    Added a generic error catcher when the server fails, returning a
    DAP-formatted error message.

2.2.0
    Moved client to use httplib2, giving us cache and authentication
    for free.

    Sequences are now iterable (this should've always been the case).

    Sequence filtering is now much more pythonic: sequences can be
    filtered using generator expressions or list comprehensions.

    Removed old logger because it was too slow.

    Rewrote dtypes.py for consistency.

    Moved ``trim()`` function to a ``constrain()`` function that
    builds the dataset instead of trimming it down.

    Module now uses Numpy exclusively.

    Moved plugins (netCDF, Matlab, SQL, compress) out of module.

    Responses (DDS, DAS, DODS, ASCII, HTML, JSON, etc.) are now
    pluggable, like plugins.

    Cleaned up the netCDF plugin *a lot*.

    Major improvements to the SQL plugin.

    Server should use environ['wsgi.errors'] for logging.

    Server uses Cheetah template for directory listing; templates can
    be overwritten to customize the server.

    Created a server template based on Paste Script.

2.1.6
    Removed fpconst dependency.

2.1.5
    Added patch from Rob Cermak to support Alias tag.

    Added patch from Peter Desnoyers making server compatible with
    ncks.

    Added patch from Peter Desnoyers to run dap-server.py in foreground.

    Added a "host" option to dap-server.py.

    Fixed ordering of Grid maps in the DDS to match the dimensions.
    This is necessary for compatibility with Ferret.

    Fixed bug when unpacking arrays of bytes (thanks to David Poulter).

    Fixed bug with Grids inside constructors (thanks to Nelson
    Castillo).

2.1.4
    Fixed bug in xdr.py (thanks to Gerald Manipon).

2.1.3
    Allow multiple filters when filtering sequences.

2.1.2
    Fixed bug when PATH_INFO is empty.

2.1.1
    Fixed netCDF shape (thanks to Bob Drach).

    Fixed bug in THREDDS catalog generator.

2.1.0 
    New release.
