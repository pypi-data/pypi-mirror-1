; To run this server, download Paste Deploy (easy_install PasteDeploy)
; and run it with:
;
;     $ paster serve docs/server.ini
;
; You should edit the "root" variable according to the location of 
; your files. 
;
; Note that this setup allows files to be downloaded if the URL is
; accessed directly, ie, without the DDS/DDS/DODS extension. This can
; be a security hazard if you are using the SQL plugin, since your
; database DSN (with username/password) will be exposed!
