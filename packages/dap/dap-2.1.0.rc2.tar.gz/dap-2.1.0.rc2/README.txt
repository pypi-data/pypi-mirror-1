This is a Python implementation of the Data Access Protocol, designed
to allow the distribution and access of scientific data through the
internet in a transparent manner. The idea behind the protocol is to
allow DAP clients to connect to DAP servers, retrieve metadata
describing the dataset, and download only a subset of the data that
interests the user.

The module is intended for two different audiences: (1) people
interested in sharing scientific data with other researchers over
the internet, without requiring any knowledge of the Python programming
language, and (2) researchers that want to access DAP servers using
Python scripts. Please read the appropriate documentation in the
docs/ directory.
