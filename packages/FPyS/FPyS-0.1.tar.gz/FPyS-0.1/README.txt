FPyS - An Amazon FPS Client for Python

FPyS utilizes the REST interface to the Amazon Flexible Payment system
to allow Python developers easy access to the Flexible Payment System.
The library works out of the box with Python 2.5.  ElementTree is a
required install in environments not yet running 2.5.  FPyS is released
under the MIT license.

The library has grown through the development of it's first example
applcation, FPeS, and so not all API methods are properly implemented
yet.  The API will become better implemented and better tested as
applications are written against it.  If you would like to help with
the testing and implementation, please make use of the support
resources listed below.
