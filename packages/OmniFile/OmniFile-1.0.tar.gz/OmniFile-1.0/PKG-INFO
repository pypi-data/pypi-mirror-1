        OmniFile
        ========
        
        OmniFile is designed for programmers who write file manipulation functions. In
        Python, there are many ways a file can be passed to a function - you can read
        the file and pass the read data, you can open the file object, or you can pass
        a filename.
        
        OmniFile's job is to handle *any* of these circumstances, based on whichever is
        convenient for the user of your function.
        
        Functions
        =========
        
        OmniRead
        --------
        ::
        
        omniread(source)
        
        Used when you only need data, OmniRead can accept file names, pre-read file
        data, and file objects. It will return pure string data.
        
        OmniRSIO
        --------
        ::
        
        omnirsio(source)
        
        Similar to OmniRead, but returns a file-like StringIO instance instead. This is
        helpful when you need file-like functionality such as iterating through lines or
        manipulating the file in place, but aren't so concerned about whether you have
        a physical location on disk.
        
        OmniOpen
        --------
        ::
        
        omniopen(source, mode)
        
        OmniOpen can handle a file's name or a file that's already been opened. It can
        be used when you need a writable file with a physical location.
