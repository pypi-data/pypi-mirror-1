Roadmap - 2008/06/30
--------------------

- make a new package plone.fckeditor

- Replace python scripts (really messed up) by clean Five views.

- Import the original fckeditor code (html + js) as a browser folder resource, 
  no more as a CMF skin layout.
  
  deadline : August 2008
  

- choose a portal_type for Media Upload

  deadline : October 2008
  
- change flvPlayer plugin :
  swfobject.js + mediaplayer js will be loaded through portal_javascript, no more inside text field.

  deadline : October 2008
  
- add options for power users roles in configlet
  power users will be able to change toolbar and/or other parameters

-------------------------
Good intents - 2008/06/13
-------------------------

- more documentation and screencasts for end users

- A more functional "plone explorer" (ajax browser to edit/remove/publish ....), which can be used
  as a separate widget for fast attachments upload,  fast linking, ... A separate
  product will be the good way.

- A python server-side spellchecker script to make fckeditor spellchecker pages
  more easy to use with Plone.
  This feature is easy to implement, but it's no more a priority because
  client side spellcheckers are more practical, and FCKEditor.Plone always
  provides FireFox and MSIE spellcheckers integration.


All contributions are welcome.
