        Introduction
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        This product is a FCKEditor Plone integration.
        This work is not a Kupu competitor, on the contrary it could not live without Kupu
        and it takes many features from Kupu.
        Talking about Kupu vs FCKeditor is a sterile discussion, use it only if you need
        it, in some situations it could be a precious partner, in other cases it could be
        unnecessary.
        
        The new default configuration is 100% Plone aware, since text fonts, forms and
        colors menus has been removed (you can always add it through configlet and toolbar
        customization at your own risk). A better solution is to improve the templates
        menu and the styles menu configurations through configlet or widget.
        
        Speaking of widget, since FCKeditor 2.4.3 a specific widget has been added in
        FCK.Plone product for developpers who want different fckeditor configurations for
        different fields in their own AT content types.
        
        For more information read documentation inside product :
        - "docs" folder contains all documentation
        - "_whatsnew.html", "_documentation.html" and "_upgrade.html" contain informations
        about the original FCKEditor product.

        FCKEditor Plone Help :
        ======================
        
        ---------------------------------
        I. FCKeditor.Plone upgrade
        ---------------------------------
        
        - Uninstall FCK editor from your Plone site (Quick Installer or Plone Control Panel)
        - Delete FCKeditor directory from your_instance/Products directory if exists (for versions < 2.6)
        - Read INSTALL.txt for buildout installation or how to use easy_install
        - Restart Zope
        - Install FCKeditor.Plone in your Plone Site via QuickInstaller or Plone Control Panel
        - Configure FCKeditor through the Plone control panel.
        
        
        FCK_PROPERTIES :
        ================
        
        When upgrading from FCKeditor.Plone >= 2.2.x fckeditor plone properties are
        preserved after install/uninstall but if you want you can clean it (recommanded) :
        ZMI > your site > portal_properties - delete fckeditor_properties
        Since FCKEditor.Plone 2.3.2 spellCheck properties have changed, if you have customized your toolbar,
        change "SpellCheck" in "rtSpellCheck" for ff2+ and MSIE6+ client spellchecker. If you were using
        aspell server spellchecker, it's not required.
        Since FCKEditor.Plone 2.3.3 "FitWindow" button has been added to switch editor field in fullscreen
        mode, if you have customized your toolbar, add 'FitWindow' in your customized toolbar.
        Since FCKEditor.Plone 2.4.1 "UniversalKey" function has been removed,
        if you have customized your toolbar, remove 'UniversalKey' from your customized toolbar.
        Since FCKEditor.Plone 2.4.3 "UniversalKey" function has been re-added as optional plugin,
        you can add 'UniversalKey' in your customized toolbar.
        Since FCKEditor.Plone 2.4.3 new important properties have been added, so deleting fckeditor_properties
        is highly recommanded (just rename it and you would be able to copy/paste by hand some of your customized properties)
        Since FCKEditor.Plone 2.6 one property have been removed : "gecko_uses_span" (no more useful because IE doesn't use Font tag anymore)
        
        CACHE :
        =======
        
        Use CacheFu to get better performances, or at least, just change standard Plone HTTPCache params (unselect anonymous only !!!).
        
        
        
        Upgrade from old FCK.Plone versions (<=2.2) :
        =============================================
        
        - Delete all previous specific FCKeditor ZMI customizations,
        
        - You could need to upgrade your members wysiwyg_editor property
        in your portal_membership (this property has changed since FCKeditor.Plone 2.0.1 for easy cohabitation with Kupu and Epoz),
        follow these steps :
        
        * In your Plone site ZMI > create an External Method
        Id            : updateFckUsers
        Title         : updateFckUsers
        Module Name   : FCKeditor.updateFckUsers
        Function Name : updateFckUsers
        
        * Click on test
        
        * Your portal_membership is updated
        
        
        
        -----------------------------------
        II. FCKeditor.Plone Update from svn
        -----------------------------------
        
        If you have downloaded FCKeditor.Plone from Plone collective SVN, launch utils/base2zope.py
        at python prompt, before installation, it's a mandatory.

        Roadmap - 2008/06/30
        --------------------
        
        - make a new package plone.fckeditor
        
        - Generic Setup Plone installer
        
        deadline : August 2008
        
        - Replace python scripts (really messed up) by clean Five views.
        
        deadline : August 2008
        
        - Import the original fckeditor code (html + js) as a browser folder resource,
        no more as a CMF skin layout.
        
        deadline : August 2008
        
        
        - choose a portal_type for Media Upload
        
        deadline : October 2008
        
        - change flvPlayer plugin :
        swfobject.js + mediaplayer js will be loaded through portal_javascript, no more inside text field.
        
        deadline : October 2008
        
        - add options for power users roles in configlet
        power users will be able to change toolbar and/or other parameters
        
        deadline : October/November 2008
        
        
        -------------------------
        Good intents - 2008/06/13
        -------------------------
        
        - more documentation and screencasts for end users
        
        - A more functional "plone explorer" (ajax browser to edit/remove/publish ....), which can be used
        as a separate widget for fast attachments upload,  fast linking, ... A separate
        product will be the good way.
        
        - A python server-side spellchecker script to make fckeditor spellchecker pages
        more easy to use with Plone.
        This feature is easy to implement, but it's no more a priority because
        client side spellcheckers are more practical, and FCKEditor.Plone always
        provides FireFox and MSIE spellcheckers integration.
        
        
        All contributions are welcome.
