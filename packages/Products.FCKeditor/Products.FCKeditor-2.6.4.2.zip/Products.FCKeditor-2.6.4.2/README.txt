Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This product is a FCKEditor Plone integration.
This work is not a Kupu competitor, on the contrary it could not live without Kupu 
and it takes many features from Kupu. 
Talking about Kupu vs FCKeditor is a sterile discussion, use it only if you need
it, in some situations it could be a precious partner, in other cases it could be 
unnecessary.

The new default configuration is 100% Plone aware, since text fonts, forms and 
colors menus has been removed (you can always add it through configlet and toolbar
customization at your own risk). A better solution is to improve the templates 
menu and the styles menu configurations through configlet or widget.

Speaking of widget, since FCKeditor 2.4.3 a specific widget has been added in 
FCK.Plone product for developpers who want different fckeditor configurations for
different fields in their own AT content types.

For more information read documentation inside product :
 - "docs" folder contains all documentation
