        Introduction
        ============
        
        This recipe satisfies the (perhaps not-so-common) use case of "I want to keep
        my buildout bootstrap.py file up to date without having to manually download
        it from svn.zope.org." It also makes it possible to add a bootstrap.py file
        to a buildout created via ``buildout init``. In other words, with this recipe
        you can avoid having to do::
        
        % svn cat svn://svn.zope.org/repos/main/zc.buildout/trunk/bootstrap/bootstrap.py > bootstrap.py
        
        Just add a new ``section``, then refer to it in your buildout section's
        ``parts``. E.g.::
        
        [buildout]
        parts =
        ...
        bootstrap
        
        [bootstrap]
        recipe = collective.recipe.bootstrap
        
        Now whenever you run buildout, this recipe will update your bootstrap.py file.
