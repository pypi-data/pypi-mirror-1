Summary: Simple HTML form for pydap server

Description: This is a simple HTML response, building a form to download data
        in ASCII format. The response builds the HTML page and redirects
        the user to the ASCII response when a POST is done.
        
        Even though pydap uses Cheetah for templating, I decided to use a
        templating engine called ``templess`` for this response. Templess
        is lightweight (~25k) and fun to work with, justifying the choice.
        
        A nice thing about the response is that the redirection to the ASCII
        response and the error message when no variable is selected are
        both done by raising exceptions. These exceptions are *not* captured
        by the server, that allows them to be captured by the Paste#httpexceptions
        middleware.
        
        If you use this response, don't forget to edit the template file
        and add a link pointing to the HTML response when clicking a filename.
        
        The latest version is available in a `Subversion repository
        <http://pydap.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/responses/html#egg=dap.responses.html-dev>`_.
