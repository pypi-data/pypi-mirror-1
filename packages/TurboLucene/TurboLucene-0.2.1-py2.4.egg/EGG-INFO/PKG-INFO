        TurboLucene
        ===========
        
        About
        -----
        
        TurboLucene is a library that allows TurboGears_ applications to use PyLucene_
        for full text searching.  It features a simple interface and takes care of all
        the nasty threading issues that exist between PyLucene and CherryPy_ (which is
        used by TurboGears).
        
        It now also features multi-lingual support for *Czech*, *Danish*, *German*,
        *Greek*, *English*, *Spanish*, *Finnish*, *French*, *Italian*, *Japanese*,
        *Korean*, *Dutch*, *Norwegian*, *Portuguese*, *Brazilian*, *Russian*,
        *Swedish*, and *Chinese*, including pre-configured stopwords for most
        languages.

        Requirements
        ------------
        
        * PyLucene 2.0.0 or better
        * TurboGears 1.0 or better
        
        Thanks to setuptools, TurboGears and it's dependencies will be installed
        automatically, if necessary.  However, PyLucene must be downloaded and
        installed manually.
        
        TurboLucene is not very demanding and may work with earlier versions of both
        PyLucene and TurboGears, but other versions have not been tested.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        TurboLucene uses setuptools, so installation is as easy as::
        
        easy_install TurboLucene
        
        or::
        
        python setup.py install
        
        For more installation options, try::
        
        python setup.py --help
        
        
        Manual Download
        ---------------
        
        The latest version can always be downloaded at http://dev.krys.ca/turbolucene.

        Limitations
        -----------
        
        TurboLucene is still in early stages of development.  It has not been
        optimised, extensively tested, benchmarked or profiled for performance or
        memory usage.  Finally, there are no test cases yet.
        
        The plan is to eliminate these limitations, eventually.
        
        Patches and suggestions are welcome! :-)

        Thanks
        ======
        
        Special thanks goes out to all the brilliant and hard working people of the
        TurboGears and PyLucene projects. Without their tireless efforts, this project
        would not exist!
        
        Also thanks to everyone in the Open Source and Free Software communities. I
        really believe the spirit and philosophy of the FLOSS movement will change the
        world. I am happy to be able to give a little back.
