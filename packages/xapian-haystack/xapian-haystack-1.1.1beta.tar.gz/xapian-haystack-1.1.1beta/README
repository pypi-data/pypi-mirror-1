Overview
--------
xapian-haystack is a backend for use with the Django Haystack search API.

More information on Haystack can be found here: http://haystacksearch.org/

xapian-haystack is licensed under the GPL, please see the included LICENSE
file for more information.

Requirements
------------

- Python 2.4 (May work with 2.3, but untested)
- Django 1.0.x
- Django-Haystack 1.0BETA
- Xapian 1.0.13+ (May work with earlier versions, but untested)
- mod_wsgi 1.3.X

Notes
-----

- Due to an issue with mod_python possibly causing deadlocks with Xapian (http://trac.xapian.org/ticket/364), when the Python is not invoked through the "main interpreter", mod_python is not supported with xapian-haystack.  It may work, with some tweaking, but your mileage will vary.
- Because Xapian does not support simultaneous WritableDatabase connections, it is *strongly* recommended that users take care when using RealTimeSearchIndex to either set `WSGIDaemonProcess processes=1` or use some other way of ensuring that there are not multiple attempts to write to the indexes.  Alternatively, use SearchIndex and a cronjob to reindex content at set time intervals (sample cronjob can be found here: http://gist.github.com/216247) or derive your own SearchIndex to implement some other form of keeping your indexes up to date.
