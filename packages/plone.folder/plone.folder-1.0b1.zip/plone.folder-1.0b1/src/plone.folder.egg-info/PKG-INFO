        Overview
        --------
        
        This package provides a base class for folderish content types based
        on `B-trees`_, a.k.a. "large folders" in Plone_.  Storing content in
        such folders provides significant `performance benefits`_ over regular
        folders.  However, "large folders" do not support explicit ordering of
        their contents out-of-the box.  That is, you cannot manually specify the
        order of items within the folder, you can only sort things according to
        a given criteria after fetching items from the folder.

        Many times, though, it is desirable to be able to explicitly order
        a folder's content, for example for items that are related to site
        navigation.  Sorting alphabetically often doesn't make sense here.
        
        To compensate ``plone.folder`` provides ordering support for `B-tree`_
        folders via the above mentioned base class, which can make use of an
        adapter to store the actual order information.  It also comes with two
        sample adapter implementations:
        
        * A default adapter handling order information for all objects
        contained in a folder.  This adapter can be used to build fully
        backwards-compatible drop-in replacements for folderish content.
        In other words, when using this adapter `B-tree`_-based folders should
        behave just like the "regular" folder implementation, but provide some
        of the performance benefits at the same time.
        
        * An alternative adapter implementation that is targeted towards
        sites with only a relatively small percentage of content for which
        (explicit) order matters.  It'll only manage order information for
        certain content types (via a marker interface).
        
        The latter allows to not having to separate such content from
        "non-orderable" content.  Up to now many large sites ended up storing
        "orderable" items |---| for example everything related to navigation
        and typically only a few |---| in regular folders and the bulk of the
        content in "large" folders, most of the time solely for performance
        reasons.  This adapter will hopefully help avoid having to make this
        distinction in the future and still provide the better performance
        characteristics of `B-tree`_ folders.
