Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Stepper is a very good Zope products. This egg is a first effort to bring some
        plone relative steps availables to developpers and site administrator.
        
        How many of you have suffer from having proxy error while trying to reindex
        a new index in a catalog ?
        
        Well now it's possible to:
        - Change all members's passwords to a unique password
        - Change all members's emails to a unique email
        - Apply a profile without busy a zope's current thread on a production server
        - Activate/Deactivate a PAS plugin: deactivate login from your website before activate a migration
        
        So if you have any idea for any reusable migration or feature for developpers, let me know.
