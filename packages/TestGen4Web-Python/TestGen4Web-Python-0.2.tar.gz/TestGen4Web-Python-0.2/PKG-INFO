Description: TestGen4Web is a tool for recording user actions
        in a FireFox web browser, saving those actions to an XML file,
        and playing them back.
        
        This package provides a means of translating
        TestGen4Web's recorded web browser sessions from XML to python. The
        package includes means for running tests as unit tests or simply
        generating python output that can be used in scripts, etc.
        
        The work in this package is based on that originally done by Matt
        Harrison. However, all bugs and issues are new and solely the
        responsibility of the current maintainer.
