##############################################

Introduction

Available functions is searching for artists, albums and tracks, as well
as looking up the same based on Spotify URIs. The data is returned as

Examples
--------

>>> import spotimeta


Search for a track

>>> search["total_results"]
1

Print the artist of that track

>>> artist = search["result"][0]["artist"]
>>> artist["name"]
u'St-Petersburg Ska-Jazz Review'

Look up more information about that artist:

>>> lookup = spotimeta.lookup(artist["href"], detail=1)
>>> for album in lookup["result"]["albums"]:
...     album["name"]
u'Too Good To Be True'
u'Too Good To Be True'
u'Live At The Red Club'

It's also possible to look up metadata using spotify URLs:

>>> track = spotimeta.lookup("http://open.spotify.com/track/3Z8cX6y0SeJIsI3yxoaQ8K")
>>> print track["result"]["artist"]["name"], "-", track["result"]["name"]
