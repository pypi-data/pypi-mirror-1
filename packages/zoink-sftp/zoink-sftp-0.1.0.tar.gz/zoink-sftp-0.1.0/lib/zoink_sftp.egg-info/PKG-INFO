        Introduction
        ============
        
        Friendly Python SSH2 interface allowing easy file and directory transfer.
        This is based on the excellent ssh.py script from:
        
        * http://commandline.org.uk/python/sftp-python-really-simple-ssh
        
        I've made this an easy installable with one or two additions and some
        basic testing. This is a really handy script and I wanted to use it
        elsewhere in a more controlled fashion. The original code was released
        under LGPL which I'm using for my additions and extension.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        This project depends on paramiko which will be installed along with this
        project via easy_install. For completeness paramiko's home is here
        
        * http://www.lag.net/paramiko/
        
        From the command line you can install this project as follows::
        
        easy_install zoink-sftp
        
        This assumes you've installed setuptools first. Alternatively you could
        download the source code and then do::
        
        cd zoink-sftp
        python setup.py install
        
        The source code is currently hosted on launchpad under bazaar revision
        control. If your interested head to the project's page here
        
        * https://launchpad.net/zoink-sftp
        
        
        Example Usage
        =============
        
        Have a look at zoinksftp/example/simple.py for a basic example
        of how to drive sftp.
