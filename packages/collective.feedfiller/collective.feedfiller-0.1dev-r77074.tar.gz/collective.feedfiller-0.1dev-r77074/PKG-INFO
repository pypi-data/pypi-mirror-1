        What is it?
        ===========
        
        *Feedfiller* is intended to work alongside collective.feedfeeder, and fill
        all the news feed items with the clean body content of the page they
        refer to.  If it does not 'know' the page format of the target page, all
        it can do is include the whole page. We will improve this as the
        project develops.
        
        Clearly there are potential copyright issues with the re-publishing of
        copyrighted works. But for research and analysis purposes, these may not
        be an issue for your organization. Our own purpose is to use collected
        text for classification and analysis for internal use. You should
        seek your own legal advice on this topic.
        
        How does it work?
        =================
        
        Feedfiller subscribes to the event created after storage of each news feed
        item created by FeedFeeder and fetches the target page of that item. This
        means that all items will be be filled with the content of the page they refer
        to. Fetched pages are flayed ("Flay: Verb: to strip off the skin or surface
        of") by a Flayer looked up in a FlayerRegistry by URL.
        
        Flayers may be easily written to accomodate new pages. Flayers can be
        created and registered for different sections of a site, in case HTML
        structure varies in sub-trees of the site.
        
        If no flayer is registered for the URL, a default flayer is used that
        returns the whole body of the page.
        
        Currently site-specific flayers try to reveal author, copyright, and body,
        but the default flayer
        
        The flayer base-class currently stores the original page fetched from
        the server, to facilitate further development and refinemement of flayers
        without repeatedly fetching content.
        
        TODO
        ====
        
        The next step is to develop a table-driven flayer, for which table entries
        can be generated interactively by clicking on an enhanced version of the
        default flay, a bit like a basic firebug view of the structure of a page
        with buttons to manually select the body area of a page. This will
        rmoyrequire a new view for this purpose, available to managers.
        
        Eventually the table-drive flayer should be able to handle the complexity of
        the BBC news page.
