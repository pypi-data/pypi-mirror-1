        What is it?
        ===========
        
        *Feedfiller* is intended to work alongside Zest Software's FeedFeeder_
        
        .. _FeedFeeder: http://plone.org/products/feedfeeder
        
        package,
        and provide the additional functionality of filling each news feed item
        with the clean body content of the page it refers to. Feedfiller can be
        educated about structure of content, to help access the most interesting page
        elements.
        If does not yet 'know' the structure of the target page, all it can do is
        include the whole page. We will improve this as the project develops.
        
        Clearly there are potential copyright issues with the re-publishing of
        copyrighted works. But for research and analysis purposes, these may not
        be an issue for your organization. Our own purpose is to use collected
        text for classification and analysis for internal use. You should
        seek your own legal advice on this topic.
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        BeautifulSoup, Products.feedfeeder.  If you use the egg package,
        these dependencies will be managed for you.
        
        How does it work?
        =================
        
        Feedfiller subscribes to the event created after storage of each news feed
        item created by FeedFeeder and fetches the target page of that item. This
        means that all items will be be filled with the content of the page they refer
        to. Fetched pages are flayed ("Flay: Verb: to strip off the skin or surface
        of") by a Flayer looked up in a FlayerRegistry by URL.
        
        Flayers may be easily written to accomodate new pages. Flayers can be
        created and registered for different sections of a site, in case HTML
        structure varies in sub-trees of the site.
        
        If no flayer is registered for the URL, a default flayer is used that
        returns the whole body of the page.
        
        Currently site-specific flayers try to reveal author, copyright, and body,
        but the default flayer
        
        The flayer base-class currently stores the original page fetched from
        the server, to facilitate further development and refinemement of flayers
        without repeatedly fetching content.
        
        TODO
        ====
        
        The next step is to develop a table-driven flayer, for which table entries
        can be generated interactively by clicking on an enhanced version of the
        default flay, a bit like a basic firebug view of the structure of a page
        with buttons to manually select the body area of a page. This will
        rmoyrequire a new view for this purpose, available to managers.
        
        There is no reason why the table-drive flayer should not be able to handle the
        complexity of the BBC news page, leaving only the trickiest pages to the
        custom class approach used currently.
        
        Table items should eventually be replicated across all other feedfiller users,
        perhaps using bi-directional rsync using a central repository, or perhaps
        using svn.
