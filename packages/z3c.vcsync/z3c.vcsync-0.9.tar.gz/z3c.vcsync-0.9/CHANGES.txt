z3c.vcsync changes
==================

0.9 (2007-11-25)
----------------

Features added
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The importing logic now allows the user to import new content over
  existing content. In this case any existing content is left alone,
  but new objects are added. Any attempt to overwrite existing content
  is ignored.

Bugs fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

* In some cases a containing directory is referenced which does not
  exist anymore when removing files. In this case we do not need to
  remove the file anymore, as the directory itself is gone.

* SVN doesn't actually remove directories, just mark them for
  removal. This could confuse the system during synchronization:
  removed directories might reappear again as they were still on the
  filesystem during loading. Make sure now that any directories marked
  for removal are also properly removed in the filesystem before load
  starts, but after up (as rm-ing a directory marked for removal
  before svn up will actually re-add this directory!).

Restructuring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Previously the datetime of last synchronization was used to
  determine what to synchronize both in the ZODB as well as in the
  checkout. This has a significant drawback if the datetime setting of
  the computer the synchronization code is running on is ahead of the
  datetime setting of the version control server: updates could be
  lost. 

  Changed the code to use a revision_nr instead. This is a number that
  increments with each synchronization, and the number can be used to
  determine both what changes have been made since last
  synchronization in the ZODB as well as in the version control
  system. This is a more robust approach.

0.8.1 (2007-11-07)
------------------

Bugs fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

* Fix a bug in conversion of SVN timestamps to datetimes. Previous
  code worked in DST, but not during winter time. The new code might
  of course break under DST - the mysterious of datetime conversion
  are legion.

* A cleaner way to cache the files listing from SVN.

* Work around a bug in the Py library. The Py library doesn't support
  the R status code from SVN and raises a NotImplementedError when it
  encounters it. Evilly catch these NotImplementedErrors for now. The
  bug has been reported upstream and should be fixed in the next
  release of Py.
