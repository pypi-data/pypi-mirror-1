Description: SplashDancing
        ===================
        SplashDancing aka Sensible Defaults
        Aims to add some "sensible defaults" to the Singing And Dancing Product
        
        The features include:
        ------------------------
        - pictures sent with news items
        - A control panel for "zapping" HTML ids and classes that should not show up in newsletters
        
        More detail
        ------------------
        This product registers an adapter for the Singing and Dancing newsletter product that detects
        if a news item has a picture and sends the picture along with the news item.
        It also provides a "through the web" (TTW), control panel where a user can list ids and classes
        that should not be sent in a newsletter.
        
        An Out of the box S&D newsletter does not allow newsitems to "travel" with their pictures and instead has a very basic representation of newsitems.
        
        It is based on ZopeSkel's 'paster create -t archetype' which is a bit overkill, but it provided all the necessary "hooks"
        to get started.

        Warning, There be Dragons
        ----------------------------
        This system works, however it will, hopefully, be refactored in the near future (by early 2010). It has only been tested with Singing and Dancing 8.12 on OS X Leopard. There is no test coverage for this code, so consider it broken.
