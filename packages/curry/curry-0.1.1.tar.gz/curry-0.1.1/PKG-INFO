Description: Overview
        ========
        
        This library provides a mechanism to use partial application on bound
        methods using AST (abstract syntax tree) transformation. You can use
        partial application as an optimization method, an alternative to code
        generation (either indirectly or through the AST abstraction).
        
        The concrete approach lies somewhere between "currying" and
        cooking. We interpret the Python-code manually by walking the AST,
        following standard Python logic (literally interpreting every
        node). Computations that can be carried out while walking are saved
        for later reference (and discarded when possible). When possible,
        computations are carried out using the running interpreter.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        You use the ``cook`` function on any bound method.
        
        >>> from curry import cook
        >>> cooked = cook(some_bound_method)
        
        Example
        -------
        
        The starting point is an instance of some class::
        
        >>> class Example(object):
        ...     def __init__(self, value):
        ...         self.value = value
        ...
        ...     def __call__(self, other):
        ...         return self.value + other
        
        We can then use partial application on the bound call-method of some
        instance::
        
        >>> from curry import cook
        >>> example = Example(1)
        >>> cooked = cook(example.__call__)
        >>> cooked(1)
        2
        
        Additional examples are included as part of a functional test suite;
        they also serve as documentation and are a good starting point to
        learn when and how to use partial application.

        Liner notes
        ===========
        
        Partial application is an entirely logical proposition; in theory, it
        should work on any method. To actually benefit from it, classes must
        be written in a suitable way. This section details the technical
        considerations that will guide the developer to a correct
        implementation.
        
        Object state
        ------------
        
        An abstract syntax tree consists of nodes corresponding to the Python
        grammar. The expression nodes represent a computation which will
        eventually be carried out. Expression nodes that may be evaluated
        during partial application are termed `resolved`. In terms of
        the tree structure, it's only possible to resolve nodes that contain
        subnodes that are resolved.
        
        When an expression node is resolved, it's replaced by a custom node
        class ``Resolved``, which holds the computed value (may be any Python
        object). As a technical detail, resolved nodes are not assigned a
        symbol name until they are visited by the code generator transform;
        internally, they are referenced using their object identity.
        
        As a result of evaluation during partial application, we will often
        have to instantiate new (stateful) objects. Initially, the state of
        these objects is known. The AST may also contain names that correspond
        to variable input. Such varibles are undefined at the time of partial
        application. When an undefined variable touches a known object, the
        state of that object becomes undefined, too::
        
        >>> out = []
        >>> out.append("Hello")
        >>> out.append(string)
        >>> "".join(out)
        
        If ``string`` is undefined, this code reduces logically to the
        following, after partial application::
        
        >>> out = ["Hello"]
        >>> out.append(string)
        >>> "".join(out)
        
        The state of the list is recorded at the time where it's state is
        first undefined.  This will be described in more detail later.
        
        State invalidation
        ------------------
        
        The known state of an object is invalidated if it touches an undefined
        object. It can only happen on the invokation of a method, but to this
        extent we must be careful to note the way Python implements its
        grammar. All operations are passed on to special methods and this
        obviously qualifies as method invokation::
        
        >>> out = ["Hello"]
        >>> out += string
        
        This invokes the ``__radd__`` method on the list object. Since
        ``string`` is undefined, it invalidates the known state of the list.
        
        As an optimization, the transformer knows about a number of built-in
        methods that are static (the state of the object never changes on
        invokation)::
        
        >>> out = ["Hello"]
        >>> out.count(string)
        
        The static ``count`` method merely counts the occurrances of a given
        string. We do not have to invalidate the list.
        
        It's important to note that any object that (transitively) references
        an undefined object must itself by undefined.
        
        Restoring object state
        ----------------------
        
        In the examples above, the mutable list object is seen as to be
        restored by using the list constructor, providing the elements that
        are known. This is essentially an optimization. In the general case,
        we could use pickles the save and restore state, but this turns out to
        be very inefficient.
        
        Rather, since the complete state of a resolved object is known, we can
        restore the state using the ``__new__`` constructor and by setting the
        instance dictionary.
        
        Instances of builtin primitives like ``list`` and ``set`` do not have
        an instance dictionary. Their state is their value. We handle these as
        special cases for optimal performance. The other cases are as
        follows:
        
        - Classes derived from mutable builtins. We instantiate the instance
        by calling the ``__new__`` constructor of the builtin (passing the
        class), then set the state using the builtin ``__init__`` method and
        finally restore the instance dictionary.
        
        - Classes derived from ``object``. We may instantiate the instance by
        calling the ``__new__`` constructor of ``object`` (passing the
        class), then restore the instance dictionary.
        
        - Either of the above that define the ``__slots__`` property. Instead of
        restoring the instance dictionary, we set each attribute.
        
        Dynamic evaluation
        ------------------
        
        The ``exec`` statement and the ``eval`` function behave
        differently. The string argument are parsed as respectively a
        statement and an expression and inserted as-is into the AST.
        
        Applications include dynamic (local) variable assignment and
        expression evaluation, both integral to template processing.
        
        Function calls
        --------------
        
        There are four different scenarios. Either the function is known, or
        the arguments are known, or both, or neither.
        
        - If both the function and its arguments are known, we compute the
        result immediately.
        
        - If the function is known, but not the arguments, we include the
        function as a closure and process partial application on it.
        
        To-Do
        -----
        
        - Star arguments and double-star keyword arguments.
        
        - Ability to mark a method as "static", e.g. using a decorator.
