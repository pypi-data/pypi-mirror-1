Installation of automirror plugin
---------------------------------

To install the plugin, you need to put this directory under your Bazaar
plugins folder (usually ``~/.bazaar/plugins``).  An easy way to do that
is to use Bazaar to branch this project right into that directory::

  $ cd ~/.bazaar/plugins
  $ bzr branch https://launchpad.net/bzr-automirror automirror

The rest of the documentation is available by typing ``bzr help automirror``
once the plugin is installed.
