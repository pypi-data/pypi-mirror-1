Name: rst2xaml
Version: 0.1.1
Summary: A docutils writer for FlowDocument XAML.

Includes an ``rst2xaml`` script that takes a reStructured Text source document
and outputs a XAML document.

FlowDocument XAML is a text markup for displaying documents in the Microsoft
Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) user interface - which is also used in
the Silverlight / Moonlight browser plugins.

The goal is to be able to write Python tutorials in reST and present them on the
web with a Python interactive interpreter running in the browser. This will also
require XAML output from Pygments.
