        django-uni-form (Django Uni-Form)
        =====================================
        
        [http://djangoproject.com Django] forms are easily rendered as tables,
        paragraphs, and unordered lists. However, elegantly rendered div based forms
        is something you have to do by hand. The purpose of this application is to
        provide a simple tag and/or filter that lets you quickly render forms in a div
        format.
        
        [http://sprawsm.com/uni-form Uni-form]  has been selected as the base model
        for the design of the forms.

        ========================
        1. Install as uni_form in your Django apps directory.
        2. Copy the site_media files in uni_form to your project site_media directory.
        uni-form-generic.css
        uni-form.css
        uni-form.jquery.js
        3. Add 'uni_form' to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py.
        4. Add '{% load uni_form %}' to the template that calls your form.
        5. Append your form call with the as_uni_form filter:
        
        {{ my_form|as_uni_form }}
        
        6. Add the class of 'uniForm' to your form. Example:
        
        <form action="" method="post" class="uniForm"
