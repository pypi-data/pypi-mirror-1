        ================
        
        This is a Django app for per-object-permissions that includes a bunch of
        helpers to create custom permission checks.
        
        The main website for django-authority is `packages.python.org/django-authority
        <http://packages.python.org/django-authority/>`_. You can also install
        the `in-development version <http://bitbucket.org/jezdez/django-authority/get/tip.gz#egg=django-authority-dev>`_
        of django-authority with ``pip install django-authority==dev`` or ``easy_install django-authority==dev``.
        
        Example
        =======
        
        To get the example project running do:
        
        - Bootstrap the buildout by running::
        
        python bootstrap.py
        
        - Get the required packages by running::
        
        bin/buildout
        
        - Sync the database::
        
        bin/django-trunk syncdb
        
        - Run the development server and visit the admin at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/::
        
        bin/django-trunk runserver
        
        Now create a flatage and open it to see some of the templatetags in action.
        Don't hesitate to use the admin to edit the permission objects.
        
        Full docs coming soon.
