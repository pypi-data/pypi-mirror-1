django-authority
================

This is a Django app for per-object-permissions that includes a bunch of
helpers to create custom permission checks.

The main website for django-authority is `packages.python.org/django-authority
<http://packages.python.org/django-authority/>`_. You can also install
the `in-development version <http://bitbucket.org/jezdez/django-authority/get/tip.gz#egg=django-authority-dev>`_ 
of pip with ``easy_install django-authority==dev``.

Example
=======

To get the example project running do:

- Bootstrap the buildout by running::

    python bootstrap.py

- Get the required packages by running::

    bin/buildout

- Sync the database::

    bin/django-trunk syncdb

- Run the development server and visit the admin at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/::

    bin/django-trunk runserver

Now create a flatage and open it to see some of the templatetags in action.
Don't hesitate to use the admin to edit the permission objects.

Full docs coming soon.

Documentation
=============

The documenation is currently in development. You can create a nice looking
html version using the setup.py::

    python setup.py build_sphinx
