        What is collective.dist ?
        =========================
        
        I have added in Python 2.6 a new feature to allow people
        to deal with several PyPlike servers in .pypirc.
        
        Basically you can use register and upload commands on any server
        registered in .pypirc, which changed a bit.
        
        But Plone and Zope runs on Python 2.4.
        
        So this package adds two new commands so you can use what will be
        available in the core in 2.6:
        
        - **mupload**: command that allows uploading the package to several servers
        - **mregister**: command that allow registering to several servers
        
        How to use collective.dist ?
        ============================
        
        **mregister** and **mupload** are replacing `register` and `upload` command
        and work with an extended version of the `.pypirc` file.
        
        In order to work with it, change your .pypirc file this way::
        
        [distutils]
        index-servers =
        pypi
        
        [pypi]
        username:user
        password:password
        
        Where `user` and `password` are your `PyPI` users.
        
        You can then start to use the commands, instead of the usual `register`
        and `upload` calls.
        
        A typical call to upload your file would be::
        
        $ python setup.py mregister sdist bdist_egg mupload
        
        To deal with several PyPI-like servers, you can add them in your
        `.pypirc` file::
        
        [distutils]
        index-servers =
        pypi
        another
        
        [pypi]
        username:user
        password:password
        
        [another]
        repository:http://another.pypi.server
        username:user2
        password:password2
        
        Then work with it, with the `-r` option::
        
        $ python setup.py mregister sdist bdist_egg mupload -r http://another.pypi.server
        
        You can even use the section name instead of the url::
        
        $ python setup.py mregister sdist bdist_egg mupload -r another
        
        And use an alias to make the code simpler::
        
        $ python setup.py alias to_another mregister sdist bdist_egg mupload -r another  # creates the alias
        $ python setup.py to_another # run the whole sequence
        
        Another usage is to deal with several profiles on PyPI::
        
        [distutils]
        index-servers =
        pypi
        pypi-personal
        
        [pypi]
        username:user
        password:password
        
        [pypi-personal]
        username:user2
        password:password2
