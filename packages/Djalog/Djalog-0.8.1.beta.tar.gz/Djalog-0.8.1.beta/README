= 1. Introduction =

Djalog provides ready-to-use logger. This is very simple logging wrapper, if you are looking for something more decent try this
http://code.google.com/p/django-logging/.
 
= 2. Installation =

In order to install Djalog you may use setuptools:
{{{
    easy_install Djalog
}}}
You may also use the most recent version by running those commands:
{{{
    hg clone https://djalog.googlecode.com/hg/ djalog
    cd djalog
    python setup.py install
}}}
*NOTE* - You will need mercurial as it is used as version control system for this project.


Djalog requires logging module which is available from Python 2.3.

= 3. Usage =

If you want to quickly check how djalog works, go into your favorite python shell and type:
{{{
    import djalog
    import logging

    logging.debug("Log some debug information.")
    logging.info("Log some information.")
    logging.warn("Log some warning.")
    logging.error("Log some error.")
    logging.critical("Log some critical information.")

    from djalog import configure
    configure(LOG_USE_COLORS=True, LOG_SQL=True, LOG_LEVEL=5)

    logging.debug("Log some debug information.")
    logging.info("Log some information.")
    logging.warn("Log some warning.")
    logging.error("Log some error.")
    logging.critical("Log some critical information.")

# Log sql query
logging.sql("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin'")
}}}

From this example you can see that changing settings for djalog utility can be done 
with `djalog.configure` method. See DjalogSettings for full list of available variables settings.

= 4. How does it work =

Djalog is simplest possible approach for Django logging. In fact, it can be easily used outside of the Django context (see example at the _Usage_ section). In
order to use it with django refer to DjalogDjango.

*WARNING* : Djalog is simple but in some cases it uses internal mechanisms of the `logging` module which may not always be desirable. For example it switches
`logging.root` logger with `djalog.loggers.DjalogLogger` or if `LOG_SQL` is set to `True` (see DjalogSql) there will be added simple `sql` method to the `logging`
module.
