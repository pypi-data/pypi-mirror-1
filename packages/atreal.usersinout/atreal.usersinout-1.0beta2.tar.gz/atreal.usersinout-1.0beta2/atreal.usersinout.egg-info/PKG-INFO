        Description
        -----------
        
        * after being installed with the Quickinstaller tool, it adds an additional
        item in the control panel.
        
        * Informations concerned are those managed by portal_registration and portal_membership.
        (i.e. username, password, roles, emails, location, description ...)
        
        * A CSV template is directly available via the control panel, to use as a base
        for your own CSV file.
        
        * There is no pretreatment. Data are used out-of-the-box. If any error occured
        in the CSV while importing, you have to correct those yourself.
        
        * On errors, this product allows you to download a CSV file only filled with the
        matching lines. Use it to correct your errors, then retry.
