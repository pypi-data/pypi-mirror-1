Description: 
        Checkpoint watches all the files in a directory (recursively), and
        allows you to revert your directory to any point in the past that you
        did a 'commit' to save your changes.
        
        Checkpoint comes as both a command-line utility AND a programming API.
        
        Users will love the Checkpoint command-line utility for its simplicity,
        and Developers will love to integrate Checkpoint into their Content
        Management Systems and other software for easy file versioning support.
        
        Checkpoint creates a sub-directory called ".cpt" where it stores
        file revisions and other information.  Files are stored as regular
        flat files.  In the future, compression support may be added to Checkpoint
        to save on disk space.
        
        Checkpoint remembers files by their path and SHA-1 checksum, in order to
        track file movement and avoid unnecessary duplicates in the
        repository.
