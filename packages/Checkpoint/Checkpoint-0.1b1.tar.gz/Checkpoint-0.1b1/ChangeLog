Checkpoint Version Control System
=================================

Checkpoint 0.1b - July 20, 2008
-------------------------------
  * Complete code reorganization: Source code is now properly split up into
    classes and modules, and all standard refractoring patterns were
    implemented so the code should now be easy to understand.
    Resolves issue #2.
  * Rough documentation created: A README, Changelog, and UsageGuide have
    been created so people can get started using Checkpoint.
    Resolves issue #10.
  * Crash recovery: A simple lockfile is now used to prevent concurrency
    issues and provide the ability to detect program crashes.  A new
    command called 'recover' has been implemented that restores the active
    set (all files seen at last successful commit), which is useful if 
    a checkpoint command crashes or is interrupted (with ctrl-C for example).
    Resolves issue #1.

Checkpoint 0.1a - July 17, 2008

  * Full functionality was implemented and manually tested.
