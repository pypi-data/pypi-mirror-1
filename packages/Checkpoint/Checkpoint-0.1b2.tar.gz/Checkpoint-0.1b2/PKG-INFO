Description: =================================
        Checkpoint Version-Control System
        =================================
        
        ------------
        Introduction
        ------------
        Checkpoint watches all the files in a directory (recursively), and
        allows you to revert your directory to any point in the past that you
        did a 'commit' to save your changes.
        
        ---------------------
        Why Make Another VCS?
        ---------------------
        While excellent Version Control Systems such as Bazaar and Mercurial already
        exist in python implementations, they are optimized for managing changes to
        *source code* using *diffs*.  They can and do handle binary files, but
        binary file operations are not blazingly fast.  From the Bazaar FAQ:
        
        ... [bazaar] is primarily a source code control system, not a
        media archive system. So it is not a priority to support enormous
        (hundred-megabyte) binaries or multi-gigabyte trees. There are other
        tools better suited to that.
        
        Checkpoint was specifically designed to quickly manipulate binary files.
        Instead of using slow binary diffs, Checkpoint sacrifices some disk space
        in order to provide the fastest possible operations.
        
        Also of great importance, the Checkpoint command-line utility is incredibly
        easy to understand, so regular users don't have to learn complex VCS
        terminology and concepts.
