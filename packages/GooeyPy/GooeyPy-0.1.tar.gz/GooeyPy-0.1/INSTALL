========================
INSTALL: GooeyPy
========================

There are two ways to use GooeyPy. Fist, you can copy the gooeypy folder into your project's root. This way, newer version won't break your code and users don't have to download GooeyPy to run your game (in which case you should also probably put cellulose in there as well). The second is to run::

    sudo python setup.py install

Which will install it onto your system. It will also download all required dependencies.
