There are two ways to use GooeyPy. Fist, you can copy the gooeypy folder into your project's root. This way, newer version won't break your code and users don't have to download GooeyPy to run your game. The second is to run::

	sudo python setup.py install

Which will install it into your system. It should also download all required libs.
