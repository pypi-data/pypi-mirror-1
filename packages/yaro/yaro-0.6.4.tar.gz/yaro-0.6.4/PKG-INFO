Description: This distribution provides Yet Another Request Object (for WSGI) in a
        way that is intended to be simple and useful for web developers who
        don't want to have to know a lot about WSGI to get the job done. It's
        also a handy convenience for those who do like to get under the hood
        but would be happy to eliminate some boilerplate without the
        encumbrance of some all-singing-all-dancing framework.
