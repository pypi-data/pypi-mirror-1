Description: This distribution provides Yet Another Request Object (for WSGI)
        in a way that is intended to be simple and useful for end users
        (by which I simply mean web developers who don't want to have to know
        a lot about WSGI to get the job done). The Yaro class can be used as a
        decorator if you are using Python 2.4, which is nice.
