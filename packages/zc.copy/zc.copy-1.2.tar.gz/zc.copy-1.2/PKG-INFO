Description: This package used to provide a pluggable replacement of ObjectCopier class
        and locationCopy function from zope.copypastemove and zope.location
        respectively. Currently, all its functionality is merged to those packages
        and the new zope.copy package is provided that contains the actual pluggable
        copying mechanism used to be in this package with no dependencies except
        zope.interface.
        
        This package now only provides backward-compatibility imports and should
        not be used for new developments.
