1.2 (2009-02-09)
----------------

- Merge this package's functionality back to zope.copypastemove,
  zope.location and zope.copy. The new zope.copy package now contains
  copy and clone functions as well as CopyPersistent helper class and
  doesn't depend on either zope.copypastemove or even zope.location,
  providing a pluggable object copying mechanism zc.copy used to provide.
  
  Now, this package only contains backward-compatibility imports.

1.1 (2009-02-09)
----------------

- Final 1.1 release. No code changes.

- Change package's mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org instead
  of retired one.

1.1b (unknown)
--------------

- Converted to eggs
