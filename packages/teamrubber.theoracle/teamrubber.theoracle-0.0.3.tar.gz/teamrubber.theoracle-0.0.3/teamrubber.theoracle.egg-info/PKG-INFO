Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The Oracle is a debug/development helper app for Plone.  It currently shows
        the following information about a given user/context:
        
        * Authenticated User Info - ID, member type, roles, etc.
        * Authenticated User Attributes
        * Basic Context Info - ID, portal_type, path, absolute_url, etc.
        * Context Workflow Info - Review state, history, assigned workflow
        * Catalog Indexes
        * Catalog Metadata
        * Methods - With ability to view source and call those which take no args
        * Attributes - including values
        * Valid/Invalid permissions
        * Context source code
        
        It also provides a fast way to drop to PDB at any given context.
        
        Installation/Use
        ================
        
        To install, just stick it in your buildout, once you've got your instance
        running, there's a few of views which you can use:
        
        * the_oracle - This is the main tool
        * pdb - Drops you to pdb at the current context (self.context)
        * the_oracall - Allows you to call methods on objects. Doesn't support
        arguments yet. eg /the_oracall?method=__makeFire
        * the_oracode - See the source of a given method.
        eg /the_oracode?method=reindexObject
        
        A Friendly Warning
        ==================
        
        DO NOT LEAVE THIS PRODUCT INSTALLED ON A PRODUCTION SITE! IT MASSIVELY
        UNDERMINES THE SECURITY OF THE SITE IT'S INSTALLED ON, AND IS VISIBLE
        TO ANY USER (EVEN ANONYMOUS).  UNINSTALLING IN ADD/REMOVE PRODUCTS
        WILL NOT DO AS THAT DOESN'T ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING. ALSO, BEARS WITH
        ASSAULT RIFLES WILL COME TO YOUR HOUSE AND ROUGH YOU UP IF YOU DO.
