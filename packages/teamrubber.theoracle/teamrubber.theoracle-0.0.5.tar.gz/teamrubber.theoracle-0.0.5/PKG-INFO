Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The Oracle is a debug/development helper app for Plone.  It currently shows
        the following information about a given user/context:
        
        * Authenticated User Info - ID, member type, roles, etc.
        * Authenticated User Attributes
        * Basic Context Info - ID, portal_type, path, absolute_url, etc.
        * Context Workflow Info - Review state, history, assigned workflow
        * Catalog Indexes
        * Catalog Metadata
        * Methods - With ability to view source and call those which take no args
        * Attributes - including values
        * Valid/Invalid permissions
        * Context source code
        
        It also provides a fast way to drop to PDB at any given context.
        
        Installation/Use
        ================
        
        To install, just stick it in your buildout, once you've got your instance
        running, there's a few of views which you can use:
        
        * the_oracle - This is the main tool
        * opdb - Drops you to pdb at the current context (self.context)
        * the_oracall - Allows you to call methods on objects. Doesn't support
        arguments yet. eg /the_oracall?method=__makeFire
        * the_oracode - See the source of a given method.
        eg /the_oracode?method=reindexObject
        
        Top Tip
        =======
        If the Context Fields section isn't showing enough information about
        the object schema, try adding ?extras=True to the url.  This will
        show extended information (Searchable, Mode, Index and Edit Accessors, Vocabulary).
        
        A Friendly Warning
        ==================
        
        DO NOT LEAVE THIS PRODUCT INSTALLED ON A PRODUCTION SITE! IT MASSIVELY
        UNDERMINES THE SECURITY OF THE SITE IT'S INSTALLED ON, AND IS VISIBLE
        TO ANY USER (EVEN ANONYMOUS).  ALSO, BEARS WITH ASSAULT RIFLES WILL
        COME TO YOUR HOUSE AND ROUGH YOU UP IF YOU DO.  TAKE A MOMENT TO THINK
        ABOUT THAT. BEARS. ANGRY BEARS. WITH GUNS. IN YOUR KITCHEN. EATING YOUR
        DINNER.
