3.5.3 (2009-03-13)
------------------

- Adapt to the removal of IXMLPresentation from zope.app.publisher which
  was removed to adapt to removal of deprecated interfaces from zope.component.

3.5.2 (2009-03-10)
------------------

- Use ISkinnable.providedBy(request) instead of IBrowserRequest as condition

  don't cause deprecation warning in Python 2.6.
