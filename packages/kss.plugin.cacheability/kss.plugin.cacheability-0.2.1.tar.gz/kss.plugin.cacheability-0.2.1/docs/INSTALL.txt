kss.plugin.cacheability installation
====================================

By hand
-------

When you're reading this you have probably already run ``easy_install
kss.plugin.cacheability``. Find out how to install setuptools (and
EasyInstall) here: http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall

Copy the file called
``kss/plugin/cacheability/kss.plugin.cacheability-configure.zcml`` in the
``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.


Using buildout
--------------

Simply add ``kss.plugin.cacheability`` to your buildout's eggs list and add it
to the zcml section of your instance config.


From within your own package
----------------------------

You can add ``kss.plugin.cacheability`` to the ``install_requires`` of your
package's setup.py. Also add a ``<zcml:include
package="kss.plugin.cacheability" />`` to your configure.zcml.
