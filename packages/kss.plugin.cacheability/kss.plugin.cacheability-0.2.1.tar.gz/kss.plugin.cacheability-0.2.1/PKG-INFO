Description: KSS plugin package "kss.plugin.cacheability"
        ============================================
        
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        This plugin enables to use cacheable (GET) KSS reguests.
        This feature will be supported in the future directly
        by kss.
        
        Usage::
        
        css:event {
        action-client: cacheability-serverAction;
        cacheability-serverAction-url: actionName;
        }
        
        The future syntax for this will be::
        
        css:event {
        action-server: actionName method(GET);
        }
        
        
        Limitation
        ----------
        
        Because currently the action runs as a client action in
        the eyes of KSS, entire forms cannot be marshalled to the
        server action. (kssSubmitForm, etc. does not work.)
        
        
        kss.plugin.cacheability installation
        ====================================
        
        By hand
        -------
        
        When you're reading this you have probably already run ``easy_install
        kss.plugin.cacheability``. Find out how to install setuptools (and
        EasyInstall) here: http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall
        
        Copy the file called
        ``kss/plugin/cacheability/kss.plugin.cacheability-configure.zcml`` in the
        ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.
        
        
        Using buildout
        --------------
        
        Simply add ``kss.plugin.cacheability`` to your buildout's eggs list and add it
        to the zcml section of your instance config.
        
        
        From within your own package
        ----------------------------
        
        You can add ``kss.plugin.cacheability`` to the ``install_requires`` of your
        package's setup.py. Also add a ``<zcml:include
        package="kss.plugin.cacheability" />`` to your configure.zcml.
