Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This portlet displays the current weather in one or more locations.
        
        It relies on an RSS feed from AccuWeather.com, and uses various icon
        sets from AccuWeather.com and elsewhere.
        
        Most of the feed parsing code is shamelessly stolen from
        collective.portlet.feedmixer, written by Wichert Akkerman.
