ABOUT SEEK AND FLAC SUPPORT:

    audiolab supports flac, because libsndfile does. Unfortunately, some FLAC
libraries seem buggy (at least the one with ubuntu Dapper is) with respect to
their seek implementation. That's why by default, seeking in flac support is
NOT enabled. If you want to test whether you FLAC library has the problem,
compile the file badflac.c in the misc directory, eg on Linux:

gcc -W -Wall badflac.c -lsndfile -o badflac

and try running ./badflac ./badflac.flac. If the program looks locked up, this
means you should NOT enable flac support. If it works OK, then you can enable
seek support in audiolab by commenting the following lines in
pysndfile.py.in (take care to modify the pysndfile.py.in, and not the
pysndfile.py file), in sndfile.__init__ (around line 500):

if self.get_file_format() == 'flac':
    def SeekNotEnabled(self, *args):
        raise FlacUnsupported("seek not supported on Flac by default, because"\
            "\n some version of FLAC libraries are buggy. Read FLAC_SUPPORT.txt")
    self.seek   = SeekNotEnabled 

Then install the package.

The pre releases version 1.0.18pre7 of libsndfile is known to work, libsndfile
1.0.17 and 1.0.16 known NOT to work (those version rely on an installed FLAC
library, whether starting from 1.0.18, libsndfile will include the FLAC library
instead of using an externally supplied one).
