Suported platforms:
-------------------

audiolab has been successfully run and tested on the following platforms:

        - windows
        - mac OS X (intel and ppc) 
        - linux (intel and ppc). 

This may work on other platforms: in particular, I expect the package to work
on most recent Unices.

Requirements
------------

To run correctly, audiolab requires the following softwares:

        - python (> 2.4): http://www.python.org
        - setuptools:
          http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools#installing-setuptools
        - numpy: http://www.scipy.org/Numpy
        - libsndfile: http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/

On Ubuntu, you can ensure to get the necessary packages by doing apt-get
install python python-setuptools libsndfile-dev python-numpy

Installing
----------

Installing is easy: once in the audiolab directory, simply do: python setup.py
install. If the installation failed because libsndfile was not found, check
that you have correctly installed libsndfile, including its headers
(sndfile.h). On windows, as there is no standard for 3rd party libraries and
header location, you can put them wherever you want, as long as the
corresponding directories are in site.cfg (see site.cfg.win32 for an example).
