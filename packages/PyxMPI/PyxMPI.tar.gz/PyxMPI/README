PyxMPI: Incomplete Object Oriented Pyrex wrapper of MPI 1.1

For usage, see the docstrings and the test script.

PyxMPI provides an MPI communicator (from mpi import world) with methods like
split, duplicate, send, receive, broadcast, gather, scatter, sum, product, ...
which work on numpy arrays. Also send/recv/bcast pickled objects. Lightly
tested, no documentation. Implemented with Pyrex.

PyxMPI was started because a year ago the existing alternatives of PyPar and
pyMPI didn't do what I needed, however pyMPI continues to improve and the new
mpi4py has an OO interface even nicer than that of PyxMPI. The main strength
of PyxMPI at present is its support for operations on numpy arrays.

I may slowly steal ideas from mpi4py and incorporate them into PyxMPI, or when
mpi4py has good support for arrays I may switch over to using that instead.
