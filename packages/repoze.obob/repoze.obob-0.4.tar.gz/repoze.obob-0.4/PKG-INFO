Description: Overview
        
        repoze.obob is a reconstruction of the "bobo" precursor of Zope (the
        "object publisher" portion), stripped down to be used as a possible
        application endpoint in the 'repoze' stack.
        
        Installation
        
        Installing setuptools
        
        repoze.obob depends on setuptools for its installation.  To install
        setuptools:
        
        - Download ez_setup.py from
        http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py
        
        - Run ez_setup.py using Python 2.4.3 or better.  You can use
        http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/virtual-python.py if you're
        running a UNIX system to avoid polluting your "system" Python's
        "site-packages" directory with repoze-required eggs.
        
        Installing repoze
        
        - After ez_setup.py is finished installing setuptools, run::
        
        $pyprefix/bin/python setup.py develop
        
        This will cause all packages required by repoze.obob to be
        installed as Python eggs in the Python site-packages directory and
        will cause the code from within the repoze.obob directory to be
        used during execution.
        
        Testing
        
        - To all run repoze.obob tests, cd to the top-level repoze.obob
        checkout dir and run::
        
        $pyprefix/bin/python setup.py test
