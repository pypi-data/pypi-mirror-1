        What is plone.introspector?
        ===========================
        
        'plone.introspector' is the Zope2/Plone UI for zope.introspector.
        It provides a way to search and browse the component registry.
        
        
        'plone.introspector' started by Martin Lundwall (Student) and Lennart Regebro (Mentor)
        as part of the Google Summer of Code 2008.
        
        The base libraries 'zope.introspector' and 'zope.introspectorui' was developed
        togeher wth another GSOC 2008 student Uli Fouquet, with mentor Martijn Faassen.
        
        
        Using plone.introspector
        ===========================
        Currently you can browse and search the component registry via the ZMI.
        
        Go to http://localhost:8080/manage and there is a tab called
        'Component Registry' where you can search the registry for entries of Adapter,
        Handler, Utility or Subscription Adapter.
        
        You can also browse all of the registry (since the registry often have many entries
        the browe page might be slow on loading) by clicking on the 'browse the registry here.' link.
        Who would have thought that?
        
        Using the browse page you can see all registrations in their respective namespace.
        You can find a registration under all involved interfaces.
        
        example:
        The adapter below is listed under all of the following interfaces
        
        * zope.viewlet.interfaces.IViewlet
        * zope.publisher.interfaces.browser.IBrowserView
        * zope.interface.Interface
        * zope.publisher.interfaces.browser.IDefaultBrowserLayer
        
        and
        
        * plone.app.layout.viewlets.interfaces.IPortalTop
        
        #
        Adapter: header
        Factory
        
        * SimpleViewletClass from /Users/martin/.buildout/eggs/plone.app.layout-1.1.5-py2.4.egg/plone/app/layout/viewlets/portal_header.pt
        
        Provided Interface
        
        * zope.viewlet.interfaces.IViewlet
        
        Required Interfaces
        
        * zope.interface.Interface
        * zope.publisher.interfaces.browser.IDefaultBrowserLayer
        * zope.publisher.interfaces.browser.IBrowserView
        * plone.app.layout.viewlets.interfaces.IPortalTop
        
        
        This makes it easy to find and make sure that all interface registrations are correct,
        and maybe find the reason why something doesn't show up as supposed to.

        To use plone.introspector do the following:
        
        Add plone.introspector to the "eggs" part of the buildout config file.
        You also need to add a "zcml" slug in the instance part.
        
        [buildout]
        eggs =
        plone.introspector
        
        A bit further down in the confinguration file.
        
        [instance]
        zcml =
        plone.introspector
        
        
        Now when you run ./bin/buildout plone.introspector will get downloaded and installed.
        
        
        Development installation:
        ------------------------
        If you want to extend, modify or check out the code you should do the following:
        
        Checkout the source and add it to you src folder in the buildout.
        
        svn co https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/plone.introspector/trunk plone.introspector
        
        In the buildout configuration file you add a "development" statement to the buildout part as well as the above mentioned entries.
        
        [buildout]
        eggs =
        plone.introspector
        
        develop =
        src/plone.introspector
        
        A bit further down in the confinguration file.
        
        [instance]
        zcml =
        plone.introspector
