        ISPManCCP - ISPMan Customer Control Panel
        =========================================
        
        ISPManCCP is a customer control panel to use with
        `ISPMan <http://ispman.net>`_.
        
        It's the alternative to the deprecated customer control panel included with
        `ISPMan <http://ispman.net>`_.
        
        Current features

        **Change Domain Password:**
        
        - Enforce passwords with a minimum six char's length(*configurable*);
        - Enforce at least two numbers in the password(*configurable*);
        - Make sure a user is not using a word from a dictionary(*words file can be
        setup, for example, the cracklib file*);
        
        **Edit User Accounts:**

        - Security restrictions are about the same as the imposed above.
        
        
        **Note:** *Mailgroup*'s support is not available on this release, probably next one.
        
        
        Download and Installation
        -------------------------
        
        The one thing ISPManCCP can't do for you is install
        `python-ldap <http://python-ldap.sourceforge.net/>`_ and
        `pyDNS <http://pydns.sourceforge.net/>`_, but most
        distributions can provide that for you.
        
        **NOTE**: If you choose not to install `pyDNS
        <http://pydns.sourceforge.net/>`_, the only that will happen is that email
        forwarding addresses will not be checked for a valid DNS MX record.
        `python-ldap <http://python-ldap.sourceforge.net/>`_ on the other hand is
        **required** and will make setup fail if not present on your system.
        
        After `python-ldap <http://python-ldap.sourceforge.net/>`_ and
        `pyDNS <http://pydns.sourceforge.net/>`_ is installed, ISPManCCP
        can then be installed with `Easy Install
        <http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall>`_ by typing::
        
        > easy_install ISPManCCP
        
        ISPManCCP setup is not fully done yet, for more specific install instructions
        please read `this <http://ccp.ufsoft.org/browser/trunk/INSTALL.txt>`_.
        
        You can find more info on the
        `ISPManCCP <http://ccp.ufsoft.org/>`_ site where bugs and new feature requests
        should go to.
