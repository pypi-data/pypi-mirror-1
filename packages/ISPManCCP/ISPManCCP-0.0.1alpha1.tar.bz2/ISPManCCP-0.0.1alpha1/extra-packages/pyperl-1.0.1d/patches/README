This directory contain various patches that you might want to apply
before building the perl/python glue:

perl-method-G_EVAL
    This patch to perl-5.6.0 make sure that we can trap all
    failures involving method calls.  This patch has been
    accepted for official inclusion in upcoming perl-5.6.1
    (change #6127).

perl-vcroak-null
    This patch to perl-5.6.0 make it possible to throw arbitrary
    objects from XS code.  We use this in order to throw
    Python::Err objects when perl call python and python throws
    an exception.   This patch has been accepted for official
    inclusion in upcoming perl-5.6.1 (change #6125).

python-20-dynload-global
    THIS PATCH SHOULD NOT BE NEEDED ANY MORE!!

    This patch to python-2.0 is needed to be able to load
    XS modules with the perl embedded in python.  It make sure
    dynamic objects are loaded with the RTLD_GLOBAL flag, so
    that names can be used to resolve objects loaded later.

python-152-dynload-global
    Same patch for Python-1.5.2
