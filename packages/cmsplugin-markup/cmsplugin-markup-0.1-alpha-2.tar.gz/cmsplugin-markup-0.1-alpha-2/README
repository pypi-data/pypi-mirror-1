========================
Django CMS MarkUp
========================

This is a fairly simple plugin for django-cms that allows using various markup
languages on a page. It impliments each of the various markup languages via 
a plugin based backend system. By default it comes with Markdown, ReST and 
Textile. It depends on Django 1.1 or newer and on Django-Cms 2.0 final or newer.

For installation instructions, see the file "INSTALL" in this directory; for
instructions on how to write your own backends, see the file "backends.rst" in
the "docs/" directory.
