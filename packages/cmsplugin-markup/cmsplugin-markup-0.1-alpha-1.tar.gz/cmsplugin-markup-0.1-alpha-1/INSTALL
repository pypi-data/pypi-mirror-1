Thanks for downloading cmsplugin-markup.

To install it, run the following command inside this directory:

    python setup.py install

If you have the Python ``easy_install`` utility available, you can also type the following to download and install in one step::

    easy_install cmsplugin-markup

Or if you're using ``pip``::

    pip install cmsplugin-markup

Or if you'd prefer you can simply place the included ``cmsplugin_markup`` directory somewhere on your Python path, or symlink to it from somewhere on your Python path; this is useful if your working from a Mercurial checkout.

Note that this application requires Python2.3 or later, and a functional installation of Django 1.` or newer as well as a functional install of Django-CMS 2.` Final or newer. Each of the markup plugins also have their own dependencies.
