Deliverance Changelog
=====================

After 0.1.2
-----------
- Add a new serializers file with HTML4 and XHTML serializers.

- (wsgimiddleware) Expose all middleware constructor arguments via
  Paste config.

- (wsgimiddleware) Check for environmental overrides of theme URI, rule
  URI, serializer, and apply.

- (wsgimiddleware) Strip out range-related headers in addition to
  the other conditional headers.

- (utils) Added APIs for parsing non-string config values 
  ('resolve_callable', 'resolve_dotted_or_egg', 'bool_from_string').

- (utils) Added APIs for getting / setting environmental overrides of
  theme URI, rule URI, serializer.

- (wsgimiddleware) Add a <meta http-equiv=content-type> to pages that
  don't already have it.

- (setup) Relax restriction on lxml 2.x (which should work fine).

- (interpreter) Run the rules in order, including running drop rules
  in order (previously they were always run before all other rules)
  and run move="1" rules in order with all the other rules.

- Deprecate the XSLT interpreter.  Changing rules to run in order was
  not feasible with the XSLT version, but the intuitive behavior was
  more important than the alternate renderer.

0.1.2 (2008-02-19)
------------------

- (setup) Added nose test runner, so you can do 'python setup.py test'.

- (wsgimiddleware) Fix typo in setting Cache-Control header.

- (xslt, utils) Keep xmlns out of places where rules are printed for
  debugging (error reports, comment).

0.1.1 (2007-10-15)
------------------

- (wsgimiddleware) Added a renderer configuration parameter to the middleware
  paste deploy configurator:  enables selection of 'py' (default) or 'xslt'
  renderers.

- (utils, xslt) Replace some truth tests of elements, which actually were
  testing if there were no subelements when they meant to be testing
  for None.

- (interpreter, xslt) Do not apply theme if x-deliverance-no-theme response
  header or meta http-equiv tag is present.

0.1 (2007-09-12)
----------------

- Initial public release.
