Description: Deliverance rewrites HTML pages to theme the pages -- adding things
        like navigation, stylesheets, and applying a common look-and-feel to
        content from a variety of sources.
        
        Unlike typical templating systems, Deliverance works only on HTML;
        there's no variables to substitute or Python structures involved.  It
        takes a simple set of rules and applies these to the HTML, so you can
        style the output of pages regardless of where the page comes from.
        
        The theme itself is an HTML page with zero code in it.  It is simply
        an example of what a page should look like; this makes it accessible
        to designers or any kind of tool, and may itself even be dynamically
        generated.  For instance, you might use a blog page as a theme, and
        wrap that theme around a wiki to give the two a common look and feel.
        
        The rules are written in an XML format, that looks something like::
        
        <rules xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
        xmlns="http://www.plone.org/deliverance" >
        <xi:include href="standardrules.xml" />
        <copy theme="//div[@id='container']"
        content="//*[@id='portal-columns']" />
        </rules>
        
        This example, in addition to doing the 'standard' things (which
        includes merging the ``<head>`` of both pages) also copies the tag
        ``<div id="portal-columns">`` into the theme page's
        ``<div id="container">``.
        
        Deliverance is implemented as both a rendering object and WSGI
        middleware.  Included in the package is a script that uses the WSGI
        middleware as an HTTP proxy.
