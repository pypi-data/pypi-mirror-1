 * The paste.deploy configuration and middleware factory now accept a `theme_uri`
   parameter.

   If used, this will be the global default theme uri.  It will be used if no
   theme is defined within the ruleset.

 * Internal subrequests that return non-200 response codes are now retried as external
   HTTP requests. (#16)

 * Request/response matching in <rule> elements now work. (#6)

 * <meta http-equiv="Content-Type"> tags are no longer stripped from documents.
   Instead, they are always included in the output of Deliverance, with a default
   charset of ASCII. (#34)

 * CDATA sections in XHTML documents are left as-is instead of being incorrectly
   escaped. (#36)

 * Before applying the rules, Deliverance now moves the <meta> tag with a charset
   declaration to be the first child of the <head> element, if both are present.
   This ensures that non-ASCII characters in the <head> are converted to the correct
   HTML sequences. (#12)

 * There is now a garbage-collecting WSGI middleware `deliverance.garbagecollect`,
   disabled by default, which calls `gc.collect()` after every request. This was
   added after a report (unconfirmed) of potential memory leaks when using some
   versions of lxml. (#22)

   You can use it with `deliverance-proxy --garbage-collect` or, in paste.deploy
   configurations, filter your app with `use = egg:Deliverance#garbagecollect`.
