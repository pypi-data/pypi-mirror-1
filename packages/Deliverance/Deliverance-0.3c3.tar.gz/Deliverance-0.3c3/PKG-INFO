Description: Deliverance does transformations of HTML to 'theme' pages, similar in
        function to XSLT but using a simpler XML-based language to express the
        transformation.
        
        New in this release:
        
        * The paste.deploy configuration and middleware factory now accept a `theme_uri`
        parameter.
        
        If used, this will be the global default theme uri.  It will be used if no
        theme is defined within the ruleset.
        
        * Internal subrequests that return non-200 response codes are now retried as external
        HTTP requests. (#16)
        
        * Request/response matching in <rule> elements now work. (#6)
        
        * <meta http-equiv="Content-Type"> tags are no longer stripped from documents.
        Instead, they are always included in the output of Deliverance, with a default
        charset of ASCII. (#34)
        
        * CDATA sections in XHTML documents are left as-is instead of being incorrectly
        escaped. (#36)
        
        * Before applying the rules, Deliverance now moves the <meta> tag with a charset
        declaration to be the first child of the <head> element, if both are present.
        This ensures that non-ASCII characters in the <head> are converted to the correct
        HTML sequences. (#12)
        
        * There is now a garbage-collecting WSGI middleware `deliverance.garbagecollect`,
        disabled by default, which calls `gc.collect()` after every request. This was
        added after a report (unconfirmed) of potential memory leaks when using some
        versions of lxml. (#22)
        
        You can use it with `deliverance-proxy --garbage-collect` or, in paste.deploy
        configurations, filter your app with `use = egg:Deliverance#garbagecollect`.
