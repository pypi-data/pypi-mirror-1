Description: Deliverance does transformations of HTML to 'theme' pages, similar in
        function to XSLT but using a simpler XML-based language to express the
        transformation.
        
        New in this release:
        * FileRuleGetter now reloads the rules file on every request if Deliverance is initialized
        with debug=true.
        
        * If the content document declares an XHTML doctype, then the output will be valid XML. (#28)
        
        * If the content document declares any doctype, that doctype will be preserved in the output.
        Otherwise, the theme's doctype will be used if present. If neither document has a doctype,
        the default is HTML 4.0 Transitional. (#28)
        
        * rule_uri can now be a file:// URI
        
        * You can now set execute_pyref=true in Paste Deploy .ini file to allow pyrefs in the rules when
        using the Deliverance middleware directly.
        
        * Fixed "join_attributes tries to join on list and set which is not valid" (#18)
        
        * Fixed util.filetourl breakage on Windows. (#13)
        
        * Added XInclude support in rules file.
        
        * Empty links in the theme like <a href=""> both work now; in the last release Deliverance would
        throw an error when trying to parse these. (#31)
        
        * When fetching the content document, responses with Content-Length:0 will be passed through to
        the client. Previously these would cause an error. (#25)
