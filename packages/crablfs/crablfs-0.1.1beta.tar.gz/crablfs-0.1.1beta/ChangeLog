2006-12-04, v0.1.1beta:
	Debug:
	* userpack, remove(), wrong 'finally' __remove_files() action.

	* lib/filetrans.py, Same file testing, only compare the pathname 
	of the 2 files.

	Functions:
	(1) lib/shadow.py:
	* Make 'install' to be a sysadm group. 
	Correspondingly move all configuration analysis from 
	__user_process() to install() for consistency.

	* Enhanced groups support, if the group is not exists, groupadd as 
	'sysadm'(ADM_MIN, ADM_MAX), default is (950, 999).

	(2) userpack: 
	* Read user/group name from profile(config) to support
	applications group, for example, 'atk', 'gtk', 'gtk2', 'xfce4' 
	all belongs to 'GTK' group for some limited directories sharing, 
	thus no modification of userpack.dirs is necessary.

	* Coreespondingly add '-G' option to support multiple groups, for 
	example, 'xfce4' belogs to 'xfce4', 'install' and 'GTK' group (
	defualt is 'xfce4' and 'install').

	(3) lib/cmdline.py: 
	* Add 'do' command for execution without being recorded in 'list'.

	* File path name auto completion, for example,
	crablfs> cmd tar xfz mlter(m-2.9.3.tar.gz)
	crablfs> cmd tar xfz /fil(e)/wor(k)/...

	(4) userpack install() and __list_files(): 
	* Add '.files' to record all files list as soon as the 
	installation is finished and read it as soon as 'list files' 
	action is taken. 
	*** This will be the base of versions' slot for pakage upgrade. ***

	* '.files' __list_file() add record mode, run at installation and
	 'L' option is given. 'L' option is 'force recording .files when 
	list_files()'.

	* Change the '.files' ownership when 'L' option is given. And 
	__remove_files() paramiters modification.

	* *** LIMITATIONS ***
	When want to install 'glib2-2.6.4', but type in error with 
	'glib-2.6.4'
	# upm -i -a -c profiles/glib2 glib-2.6.4
	This will mistakenly remove glib-1.2.10!!!
	So far, this limitation roots in the limitation of package 
	version control, this also makes 'upgrade' not easy.
	
	(5) setup-blfs, build python-2.4.1, pexpect-2.1(optional), 
	crablfs-0.1.1 tools chian for BLFS.

	(6) Add simplified actions of userpack, for example, 'i' for 
	'install', 'r' for 'remove', etc..., and 'upm' for 'userpack' 
	itself.

2006-11-20, v0.1.1alpha:
	Some bugs fixed. See "svn log -r56, -r60, -r62":
	* lib/shadow.py _join(), the privious version has add an extra 
	',' at the beginning of the users string the first time add user 
	to the 'install' group.

	* userpack __user_process(), no patches configuration was read 
	in the privious version.

	* userpack __get_copy(), rename action before copy action, this 
	makes copy can't be executed.

	* userpack getopt '-o' option,
	option, value = re.split('\s*=\s*', v)
	value = value.strip('"\'')
	strip "" or '' quotation because the internal code doesn't need it
	, otherwise something such as 'PACKS_DIR' will be wrong.

	* cmdline interactive mode may chdir by user, so it is neccessary 
	to specify /home/roc to make .config to be in its root.

	Remove the 'pexpect' requirement of filetrans, make it optional.

2006-10-27, v0.1:
	The first version. A package manager 'userpack' written in python
	with basic functions, such as install, remove, list, find files, 
	find package owner, etc under the control of system normal user.

	And a python batch script 'crablfs' to install all packages in a 
	list -- the turn key way.
