Security
========

There are data that always should be stored in our data bases after to be
encrypted, to avoid that a possible cracker can to make use of all this
information as valuable.

Mainly, it should be encrypted information that can identify to our users, and
related with pay systems:

* E-mail
* IP address (if it's related with the users)
* Card debit/credit
* Full name (only if the user wants that not been public)
* Messengers address

Of this way, althought it would be data for each user about her/his country,
language, day of birthday, or gender, it would be information without any value
for a possible attacker since can not be related with any real user.
