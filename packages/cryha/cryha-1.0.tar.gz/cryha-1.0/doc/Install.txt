=============
Install Cryha
=============

Installation requirements
=========================

Cryha may not install/work properly unless it is installed the following
packages:

1- *Python 2.4*

2- *Hashlib* or *MHash/python-mhash*

	`Hashlib <http://docs.python.org/lib/module-hashlib.html>`_ is a standard
	library since Python 2.5, but it can be installed in older versions.

	I recommend to use `python-mhash <http://labix.org/python-mhash>`_ because
	it has many more hash functions than *Hashlib* and it is faster since it is
	a wrapper to `MHash <http://mhash.sourceforge.net/>`_ library.

3- *MCrypt/python-mcrypt*

	`python-mcrypt <http://labix.org/python-mcrypt>`_ is an interface to
	`MCrypt <http://mcrypt.sourceforge.net/>`_ library.


**Note:** it is not necessary to have to install both MCrypt and MHash to use
Cryha since that hasher and crypter modules are completely independent.

Installation
============

It is necessary to have installed the header libraries of *MHash* and
*MCrypt* to build the python interfaces.

Debian / Ubuntu
---------------
::

	# apt-get install libmhash-dev libmcrypt-dev

Windows
-------

There are not binaries compiled for windows of both *MCrypt* and *MHash*
libraries, although they can also been ported to Win32 using the Cygwin_
compiler; you can find both libraries in the `package list`_.
