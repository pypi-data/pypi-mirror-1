<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Dejavu is a thread-safe Object-Relational Mapper for Python applications.
It is designed to provide the "Model" third of an MVC application. When you
build an application using Dejavu, you must supply the Controller(s) and
View(s) yourself. Dejavu does not provide these, and does its best to not
limit your choices regarding them.</p>

<p>If you're familiar with Martin Fowler's work <a href='#fowler'>[1]</a>,
you can think of Dejavu as providing a Data Source layer, plus the tools
to write your own Domain layer. For the Presentation layer, you're on your
own. ;) It primarily uses a generic Data Mapper architecture (as opposed
to the more tightly-coupled Active Record architecture).</p>

<h3>Basic Structure</h3>
<p>Developers build their Model by creating classes which subclass
<tt>dejavu.Unit</tt>; in RDBMS terminology,
each Unit subclass corresponds to a table; instances of the class
correspond to the rows. Each subclass possesses a set of attributes known
as "properties", which you can think of as columns in your database
table. These attributes are generally formed from a <tt>UnitProperty</tt>
descriptor. Any Unit data which needs to be persisted ought to be contained
in a Unit Property. However, Unit classes can also possess arbitrary
methods and attributes which aid their use within the application.</p>

<p>Unit classes can be <i>associated</i> to other Unit classes. This means
that one of the properties of UnitA maps to one of the properties of UnitB.
Related objects may then be looked up more easily.</p>

<p>Units are managed in memory by <tt>Sandbox</tt> objects, which function
as "Identity Maps" <a href='#fowler'>[1]</a>: in-memory caches of Units
which keep commit conflicts to a minimum. Unit objects can be "memorized"
and "recalled" from a <tt>Sandbox</tt>, using pure Python lambda expressions
<a href='#cpython'>[2]</a> as a query language. The lambda is wrapped
in an <tt>Expression</tt> object to make it portable.</p>

<p>Sandboxes persist Unit data by <tt>StorageManager</tt> objects. Each
persistence mechanism has its own subclass of the <tt>StorageManager</tt>
class; for example, persisting Unit data to a Microsoft SQL Server database
requires a <tt>StorageManagerADO_SQLServer</tt> object. When recalling data,
Storage Managers receive Expression objects; database SM's, for example,
will typically examine these Expressions and produce SQL statements from
them, which they then use to retrieve data. Storage Managers also handle
the creation of new Units, and their destruction.</p>

<p>Finally, Dejavu provides a core <tt>Arena</tt> class which you should be
able to leverage for any sort of application you are building. The Arena
object functions as a top-level "Application" object, collecting the global
settings for an application into one place. It doles out Sandboxes,
maintains a registry of Units and their associations, and manages startup
and shutdown operations.</p>


<h3>Simple Example</h3>

<p>Since a block of code is often worth a thousand words, here's a minimal
example of a Dejavu application:</p>

zookeeper.py
<pre>import dejavu

class Zoo(dejavu.Unit):
    Name = dejavu.UnitProperty()
    Size = dejavu.UnitProperty(int)
    
    def total_legs(self):
        return sum([x.Legs for x in self.Animal()])

class Animal(dejavu.Unit):
    Legs = dejavu.UnitProperty(int, default=4)

Animal.set_properties({"Name": unicode,
                       "ZooID": int,
                       })
Animal.many_to_one('ZooID', Zoo, 'ID')

# Set up a global Arena object.
arena = dejavu.Arena()
conf = {u'Connect': r"PROVIDER=MICROSOFT.JET.OLEDB.4.0;DATA SOURCE=C:\zookeeper.mdb;"}
arena.add_store("main", "access", conf)
arena.register_all(globals())</pre>

<p>The above creates the model for the zookeeper application.
There are three basic things happening:
    <ol>
        <li>The <tt>Zoo</tt> and <tt>Animal</tt> classes, which subclass
            <tt>dejavu.Unit</tt>. These will correspond to the Zoo and
            Animal tables within the database. Notice the two different
            methods of declaring Unit properties. Each class also inherits
            an 'ID' property (an int) from <tt>dejavu.Unit</tt>.</li>
        <li>The association between the Animal class and the Zoo class
            (many-to-one).</li>
        <li>The setup of a dejavu <tt>Arena</tt> object, including a Storage
            Manager which uses a Microsoft Access (Jet) database.</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>Here's a simple interactive session which uses the above (assume that
tables have been created and populated elsewhere):</p>

<pre>>>> import zookeeper
>>> box = zookeeper.arena.new_sandbox()
>>> box.recall(zookeeper.Animal)
[&lt;zookeeper.Animal object at 0x013281F0>, &lt;zookeeper.Animal object at 0x01328150>,
 &lt;zookeeper.Animal object at 0x01328130>, &lt;zookeeper.Animal object at 0x01328230>]
>>> box.recall(zookeeper.Zoo)
[]
>>> zoo = zookeeper.Zoo(Name='San Diego Zoo', Size='38')
>>> box.memorize(zoo)
>>> zoo.ID
1
>>> box.unit(zookeeper.Zoo, ID=1) is zoo
True
>>> for creature in box.recall(zookeeper.Animal):
        zoo.add(creature)
>>> len(zoo.Animal())
4</pre>


<h3>Design Goals</h3>

<p>Dejavu is designed to function in environments with complex integration
needs, and tends to separate concerns as much as possible. In particular,
Dejavu tries to avoid making decisions in the framework which are better
left to developers. Some of those decisions are:
    <ul>
        <li>Uer interface. Dejavu works well in all sorts of applications,
            whether desktop, thin-client or web.</li>
        <li>Application package architecture. You can place your application
            within a single Python module, develop complete packages,
            or use Dejavu inside a larger framework.</li>
        <li>Which types to use for <tt>Unit</tt> properties. Builtin types
            are fully supported out of the box, including datetime and
            decimal. Tim Peters' excellent <tt>fixedpoint</tt> module
            is also available. New types are easily added.</li>
        <li>Which keys to use when associating <tt>Unit</tt> classes.</li>
        <li>What to name identifiers.</li>
    </ul>

In the same way, Dejavu tries to avoid having developers make decisions
which are better left to deployers. Some of those decisions are:
    <ul>
        <li>Where (and how) to log error messages.</li>
        <li>Which storage mechanism (database or ...?) to use. In particular,
            deployers are allowed to mix and match stores, including how
            and when to cache objects in memory. Dejavu tries to make
            it easy for <i>deployers</i> to tune applications to their
            particular environment.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>Unlike most generic storage wrappers, Dejavu does not <i>require</i> you
to have complete control of your back end. For example, consider Mission
Control, the first application built on Dejavu. Mission Control required
an ORM which transparently supported two very different backends. Half of
the data was to be stored in an MS Access database,
over which the application developers had full control.
But half of the data was stored in a third-party application, "The Raiser's
Edge" (RE) from Blackbaud. RE provides read-only database access; all writes
must go through their object-oriented API. Further, reading via that API was
found to be too slow. Therefore, a custom Storage Manager (about 2500 lines
of code) was developed, which searches for and loads objects via SQL, but
writes Unit data via the REAPI. Dejavu allows the application logic to be
completely ignorant of this complex mass of storage details. If Blackbaud
closed its doors tomorrow, the solution could be quickly migrated to another
data store; business downtime is reduced in the face of inevitable change.<p>

<h3>Obtaining and Installing</h3>

<p>You can obtain Dejavu from its Subversion repository at
<tt>http://projects.amor.org/dejavu/svn/trunk</tt>. Dejavu is designed to be
installed in <tt>site-packages/dejavu</tt> or some other root python
path.</p>

<p>Dejavu was built using Python 2.3.2. You should probably use
at least 2.3; Dejavu depends upon the <tt>datetime</tt> module.
Although Dejavu <i>supports</i> additional modules like
<tt>fixedpoint</tt> and <tt>decimal</tt>, it does not <i>require</i>
them.</p>

<p>Dejavu uses bytecode hacks, and therefore requires CPython
<a href='#cpython'>[2]</a>.</p>

<h3>Compared To Other Database Wrappers</h3>
<h4>SQLObject</h4>
<p>No matter what project I start on, odds are I'll discover that Ian
Bicking has already done the same thing, usually better.
<br />See http://blog.ianbicking.org/another-less-sleepy-alternative-to-hibernate.html
<br />Which was a reply to Ruby's ActiveRecord:
http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000297.html
<br />Which was a reply to Java's Hibernate:
http://informit.com/guides/content.asp?g=java&seqNum=127&f1=rss</p>

<p>Using dejavu, the application developer supplies the following code
to define the Units and their relationships:</p>

<pre>from dejavu import *
import fixedpoint   # or decimal, for Python 2.4+
import datetime

class Book(Unit):
    # The ID field is already set to 'int' for all Unit subclasses.
    title = UnitProperty(str)
    price = UnitProperty(fixedpoint.Fixedpoint)
    publishDate = UnitProperty(datetime.datetime)
    publisher = UnitProperty(int)
    
    def addAuthor(self, author):
        a = Authorship(authorID=author.ID, bookID=self.ID)
        self.sandbox.memorize(a)
    
    def author_names(self):
        names = []
        for authorship in self.Authorship():
            author = authorship.Author()
            if author:
                names.append(author.name)
        return u', '.join(names)

class Publisher(Unit):
    name = UnitProperty(str)

class Author(Unit):
    name = UnitProperty(str)

class Authorship(Unit):
    authorID = UnitProperty(int)
    bookID = UnitProperty(int)

Book.many_to_one('publisher', Publisher, 'ID')
Authorship.many_to_one('bookID', Book, 'ID')
Authorship.many_to_one('authorID', Author, 'ID')

arena = Arena()
arena.register_all(globals())
</pre>


<p>The deployer would write in a .conf file:</p>
<pre>[Books]
Class: dejavu.storage.storepypgsql.StorageManagerPgSQL
Connect: host=localhost dbname=bookstore user=postgres password=****</pre>

<p>To create the tables:</p>
<pre>for cls in (Author, Publisher, Book):
    arena.create_storage(cls)</pre>

<p>The app developer's runtime code reads as follows:</p>
<pre>
box = arena.new_sandbox()
ppython = Book(title='Programming Python', price=20,
               publishDate=datetime.datetime(2001, 3, 1))
# This next line is redundant; all properties default to None.
# But explicitness is rarely a bad thing.
ppython.publisher = None
box.memorize(ppython)

print ppython.title # output: 'Programming Python'

mlutz = Author(name = 'Mark Lutz')
box.memorize(mlutz) # give mlutz an ID
ppython.addAuthor(mlutz)

print len(ppython.Authorship()) # output: 1
print ppython.author_names() # output: 'Mark Lutz'

oreilly = Publisher(name="O'Reilly")
box.memorize(oreilly) # give oreilly an ID

ppython.publisher = oreilly.ID
print ppython.Publisher().name # output: "O'Reilly"

print len(oreilly.Book()) # output: 1

print 'Hi,', oreilly.Book().author_names() # output: "Hi, Mark Lutz"
</pre>

<a name='cpython'>[2]</a> Dejavu relies upon bytecode hacking to achieve
its clean lambda syntax for data queries. Therefore, it is CPython-specific.
In addition, the bytecode of Python may change from one version of Python
to another; if you find your version of Python does not work with Dejavu's
