<h2>Application Developers: Managing Units</h2>

<a name='sandboxes'><h3>Sandboxes</h3></a>
<p>During the life of a client connection, your application should create
and use a <tt>Sandbox</tt> to manage the set of "live" Units. A Sandbox
manages the in-memory lifecycle of Units: creation, identity, mutation, and
destruction. Sandboxes route persistence operations on Units to the correct
Storage Manager.</p>

<p>You can create Sandbox objects directly. They take a single argument, the
top-level <tt>Arena</tt> object. Arenas also provide a convenience function,
<tt class='def'>new_sandbox</tt>, which does this for you. The following
lines are equivalent:
<pre>box = dejavu.Sandbox(myArena)

box = myArena.new_sandbox()</pre>
You might often choose the latter when you have a reference to the Arena
object, and would rather avoid importing dejavu yet again just to obtain
the Sandbox class.</p>

<a name='memorize'><h4>Memorizing Units</h4></a>
<p>When you create a Unit instance, it exists in isolation. There is no
connection between that Unit and storage; your Unit will not be persisted,
because Dejavu doesn't yet possess a reference to your Unit. To provide
that link, you <i>memorize</i> your Unit (or rather, you tell your Sandbox
to memorize it):
<pre>class Publisher(Unit):
    City = UnitProperty(unicode)

p = Publisher(ID='Walter J. Black')
box.memorize(p)</pre></p>

<p>Memorization does several things. First, it places your new Unit into
your Arena. That Unit instance will now be persisted by the appropriate
Storage Manager. It can be recalled from storage when needed, using the
built-in Expression syntax. It may have been given an ID (see
<u>Sequencing</u>, below). Memorization also makes your Unit
<i>concrete</i>; that is, your Unit will now possess a <tt>sandbox</tt>
attribute. Units whose <tt>sandbox</tt> attribute is not set (is None)
have no relationships, and their Unit Property triggers (if any) will
not fire.</p>

<p>You may define special methods on your Units to provide start-of-life
behaviors. If a Unit possesses an <tt>on_memorize</tt> method, it will
be called after the Unit has been 'reserved' in storage and placed in
the Sandbox cache.</p>

<h4>Sequencing</h4>
<p>Every <tt>Unit</tt> has one or more identifiers. The default ID property
is of type <tt>int</tt>; however, you can override that to whatever type
you like. As long as you provide your own identifier values for Units,
nothing will break--you can memorize and recall Units without problems.
However, if you memorize a Unit with an ID of <tt>None</tt>, the Sandbox
may attempt to provide an ID for it.</p>

<p>The <tt>Unit</tt> base class possesses a <tt>sequencer</tt> attribute
to help Sandboxes generate new IDs. The default value is an instance of
<tt>UnitSequencerInteger</tt>, which examines all existing Units, finds
the maximum integer ID, adds 1, and uses that value for the new ID.
[StorageManagers are free to optimize any sequencer, whether builtin or
custom, in order to take advantage of ID-generation tools in the database
or other storage provider. All builtin database StorageManagers optimize
UnitSequencerInteger in this way.]</p>

<p>The other useful Sequencer is the base class <tt>UnitSequencer</tt>,
which simply raises an error when asked to generate an ID. If you set
<tt>ClassA.ID</tt> to a string or unicode type, you'll probably want to set
<tt>ClassA.sequencer = dejavu.UnitSequencer()</tt>, and form ID values
in your own code.</p>

<h4>Recalling</h4>
<p>Once you have memorized a Unit or two, you will probably want to
recall them at some point. Sandboxes possess four member functions to
accomplish this.</p>

<h5>recall()</h5>
<p>First, the appropriately named
<tt class='def'>recall(cls, expr=None, inherit=False, **kwargs)</tt> function.
This is the full-blown query method. As a first argument, you pass it the
class (<b>not</b> the name of the class, but the actual class) of which you
expect to retrieve instances. The second argument should be a lambda, or an instance
of <tt>dejavu.logic.Expression</tt>, an object which encapsulates your
specific query (see <a href='#Querying'>Querying</a>).
Alternately, you may supply keyword arguments, which will then be
combined into an Expression for you.
The following three examples are equivalent and all result in the same output:
<pre>>>> units = box.recall(Book, Year=1928)
>>> units = box.recall(Book, lambda x: x.Year == 1928)
>>> units = box.recall(Book, logic.Expression(lambda x: x.Year == 1928))
>>> [x.Title for x in units]
[u'The Giant Horse of Oz', u'Kai Lung Unrolls His Mat',
 u'Tarzan, The Lord of the Jungle']
</pre>
If you do not supply an Expression or any keyword args, all Units of the
given Unit class will be retrieved in a list.</p>

<p>If your Unit class defines an <tt>on_recall()</tt> method, it will be
called when each Unit has been loaded from storage (at the end of the
recall process). Once the unit is loaded into a Sandbox, however,
<tt>on_recall</tt> will not be called; it's only called at the Sandbox/SM
boundary. If <tt>on_recall</tt> raises <tt>UnrecallableError</tt>, the
unit will not be yielded back to the caller, nor placed in the Sandbox
cache.</p>

<h5>Recalling multiple classes at once (JOINs)</h5>

<p>In addition to providing a single class to <tt>recall</tt>, you have
the option of providing a tree of classes, a nested set of
<tt class='def'>UnitJoin(class1, class2, leftbiased=None)</tt>
instances.</p>


<p>The "leftbiased" argument specifies how the results will be joined:</p>

<table>
<tr><th>leftbiased</th><th>Join&nbsp;Type</th><th>Description</th><th>Operator</th></tr>
<tr>
    <td>None</td>
    <td>Inner Join</td>
    <td>All related pairs of both classes will be returned.</td>
    <td><tt>&</tt> or <tt>+</tt></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>True</td>
    <td>Left Join</td>
    <td>All related pairs of both classes will be returned. In addition,
        if any Unit in class1 has no match in class2, we return a single
        row with Unit1 and a "null Unit" (a Unit, all of whose properties
        are None).</td>
    <td><tt>&lt;&lt;</tt></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>False</td>
    <td>Right Join</td>
    <td>All related pairs of both classes will be returned. In addition,
        if any Unit in class2 has no match in class1, we return a single
        row with a "null Unit" (a Unit, all of whose properties are None)
        and Unit2.</td>
    <td><tt>&gt;&gt;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Look hard? Fear not. There's a <b>much</b> easier way to join units than
writing a big tree of UnitJoins. Use the &amp;, &lt;&lt;, and &gt;&gt;
operators directly with Unit classes:</p>

<pre>tree = (Book &lt;&lt; Publisher) & Author</pre>

<p>This example will automatically produce a UnitJoin tree for you,
with Book 'left joined' to Publisher, and then 'inner joined' to
Author.</p>

<p>When you provide multiple classes, the <tt>recall</tt> method returns
a list of rows. Each row will be a list of units, one per class in the
<tt>classes</tt> arg. The <tt>expr</tt> arg should be a
<tt>logic.Expression</tt> which can evaluate all of the
units in any given row at once.

<pre>for pub, book in box.recall(Publisher & Book, lambda p, b: p.ID == 4)</pre>

This example will retrieve a series of [Publisher, Book] pairs.
Note that all three constructs (the UnitJoins, the lambda arguments, and
the resulting rows) have the same classes listed in order from
left to right.</p>

<p>In database terminology, this technique performs a series of joins
between each pair of classes in your UnitJoin tree. However, repeated units
in the results will reference the same object; in the example above, each
"pub" unit will be the same object, since we limited that expression to
a single Publisher. So we might retrieve multiple (pub, book) pairs,
but the first unit in each pair will be the same unit instance.</p>

<p>The relationships (joins) between each class are specified by
<a href='modeling.html#associations'>Unit Associations</a>).</p>

<h5>xrecall()</h5>
<p>Just like recall, but returns an iterator instead of a list. Use xrecall
to load Units in a more lazy fashion.</p>

<h5>unit()</h5>
<p>The <tt>recall</tt> method can be verbose. When you want a one-liner
and only expect a single Unit, use the
<tt class='def'>unit(cls, expr=None, inherit=False, **kw)</tt> method
of Sandboxes. Again, you pass the class of Units you wish to retrieve
as the first argument. Then, supply a logic.Expression, or keyword arguments
of the form
"property_name=value". The method will form an equivalent Expression
for you from the keyword args. For example:
<pre>>>> book = box.unit(Book, ID=1)
>>> if book:
...     print book.Title
u'Ladies in Hades'</pre>
If no Unit can be found that matches the criteria, None is returned.
If multiple Units match the criteria, only the first one is returned
(although the rest are probably loaded into memory).</p>

<h5>"Magic recaller" methods</h5>
<p>For each class you have registered with your Arena, the Sandbox will
have a "magic recaller" method of the same name, to make single-unit
lookups easier. Instead of the above example for <tt>box.unit()</tt>,
we might just as well have written:
<pre>>>> book = box.Book(1)</pre>
Note that for the magic methods, unlike for the <tt>unit</tt> method,
you may pass identifiers as positional arguments. If the class has
multiple identifiers, you should probably stick to keyword arguments;
otherwise, you must remember the order of the class' identifiers tuple.
</p>

<h4>Forgetting and Repressing</h4>
<p>To <i>forget</i> a Unit is to destroy it forever. You have two options
for forgetting Units: you can call <tt>sandbox.forget(unit)</tt> or
the simpler version, <tt class='def'>unit.forget()</tt>. Either of these will clear
the Unit from the Sandbox' cache, and the Sandbox will tell the appropriate
Storage Manager to destroy the stored Unit data. If a Unit has not yet
been memorized, you do not need to forget it.</p>

<p>In some circumstances, you may wish to only clear the Unit from the
Sandbox without destroying it. You can do this by calling either
<tt>sandbox.repress(unit)</tt> or the simpler version,
<tt class='def'>unit.repress()</tt>.</p>

<p>You may define special methods on your Units to provide end-of-life
behaviors. If a Unit possesses an <tt>on_forget</tt> method, it will
be called after the Unit has been destroyed. If a Unit possesses an
<tt>on_repress</tt> method, it will be called <i>before</i> the Unit
has been repressed. I'm sure there was a good reason for this
disparity, but I've forgotten (or perhaps repressed) it.</p>

<p>Be aware that many of the things you put in an <tt>on_repress</tt>
handler might also need to go into <tt>on_forget</tt>. The one doesn't
call the other automatically, because sometimes you <i>don't</i> want
the same behavior.</p>


<h4>Flushing Sandboxes</h4>
<p>When the client connection has closed, you should <i>flush</i> the
Sandbox caches. In general, a single call to
<tt class='def'>sandbox.flush_all()</tt>
will do the trick. Notice that <tt>flush_all()</tt> calls any
<tt>on_repress()</tt> handler for each Unit in the Sandbox.</p>

<p><b>Warning:</b> You should <b>NOT</b> call <tt>flush_all()</tt>
indiscriminately. You will rapidly get into concurrency trouble. You
can stay out of trouble following an easy rule: call <tt>flush_all</tt>
only at the end of your client's connection.</p>

<p>If you want the "hard" rule, here it is. If you flush any Unit class,
then any instances of that class hanging around need to be re-recalled. If
you don't re-recall them, then any changes you make to the old instance
won't be saved on the next flush, since flushing only iterates through
units in the sandbox. For example, if you do this:</p>

<pre>box = arena.new_sandbox()
thing = box.unit(Thing)
box.flush_all()
thing.Size += 12
box.flush_all()
</pre>

<p>...then the change you make to "Size" won't be persisted, since the
Thing object is no longer in the sandbox--it's been flushed out. You have
to recall it somehow to get it stuck in the sandbox again. You could go
through all kinds of gyrations to save the old units directly to storage,
but don't bother. Just get new references to them and save yourself a lot
of headache.</p>

<h4>Views</h4>
<p>Sandboxes provide a
<tt class='def'>view(cls, attrs, expr=None, **kwargs)</tt> function.
This works like <tt>recall</tt>, but returns values, rather than Units.
Put simply, it yields all values
for the given attribute(s) of the Unit class provided; each unit will
yield a tuple of its values in the same order as the <tt>attrs</tt>
sequence you provide. Providing an expr argument (either a lambda or an
<tt>Expression</tt>
object, see below), or keyword arguments, will filter the set of Units
before obtaining the value tuples.</p>

<pre>>>> v = sandbox.view(zoo.Animal, ['Name', 'Lifespan'])
>>> [row for row in v]    # or list(v), or iterate over v...
[('Leopard', 73.5),
 ('Slug', .75),
 ('Tiger', None),
 ('Lion', None),
 ('Bear', None),
 ('Ostrich', 103.2),
 ('Centipede', None),
 ('Emperor Penguin', None),
 ('Adelie Penguin', None),
 ('Millipede', None)
 ]
</pre>

<p>In this example (pulled from the "zoo" test suite), we grab the name
and Lifespan for each Animal. The <tt>attrs</tt> argument must always
be an iterable.</p>

<p>Sandboxes also provide a
<tt class='def'>distinct(cls, attrs, expr=None, **kwargs)</tt>
function. This works just like <tt>view</tt>, but returns distinct
tuples rather than all tuples.</p>

<p>The <tt>distinct</tt> function can also be used as a <tt>count</tt>
function by passing <tt>attrs = cls.identifiers</tt>.
Sandboxes provide a <tt class='def'>count(cls, expr=None, **kwargs)</tt>
method which does just this.</p>

<p>Dejavu 1.5 adds two new sandbox methods: range and sum. The
<tt class='def'>range(cls, attr, expr, **kw)</tt> method takes a single
attribute and returns the closed interval [min(attr), ..., max(attr)]. The
<tt class='def'>sum(cls, attr, expr, **kw)</tt> method also takes a single
attribute and returns the sum of all non-None values for the given
cls.attr.</p>


<h4>Transactions</h4>
<p>Dejavu supports distributed transactions at all levels (however, it
does not yet use distributed two-phase commit! That's planned for 1.6).
Most often, your code will call transaction methods on the current 
sandbox object.
When you call sandbox.<tt class='def'>start(isolation=None)</tt>,
you are telling Dejavu to begin a transaction on all known stores.
Note that this will start a transaction on all stores regardless of
which classes are registered for each store; Dejavu has no way of
knowing beforehand which classes or stores your next statements
will affect.</p>

<p>The <tt>isolation</tt> argument to the <tt>start</tt> method is very
important. It determines the "isolation level" of the transaction;
that is, the degree to which the current transaction can see changes made
to a concurrent transaction. The ANSI/ISO SQL92 standard defines four
isolation levels, based on three phenomena:</p>

<table style='border: none;'>
<tr>
    <th rowspan='2' colspan='2' style='border: none;'>&nbsp;</th>
    <th colspan='4'>Level</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th>Read Uncommitted</th>
    <th>Read Committed</th>
    <th>Repeatable Read</th>
    <th>Serializable</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th rowspan='3'>P<br />h<br />e<br />n<br />o<br />m<br />e<br />n<br />a</th>
    <th>Dirty Read</th>
    <td>Possible</td>
    <td>Not possible</td>
    <td>Not possible</td>
    <td>Not possible</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th>Fuzzy Read</th>
    <td>Possible</td>
    <td>Possible</td>
    <td>Not possible</td>
    <td>Not possible</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th>Phantom</th>
    <td>Possible</td>
    <td>Possible</td>
    <td>Possible</td>
    <td>Not possible</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>A "dirty read" occurs when TX 1 writes a value and TX 2 is able to read
the change before TX 1 commits.</p>

<p>A "fuzzy read" (or "nonrepeatable read" occurs when TX 1 reads a value,
TX 2 changes that value and commits, and TX 1 obtains the new value when
it re-reads.</p>

<p>A "phantom" occurs when TX 1 reads a set, TX 2 adds to the set,
and TX 1 obtains the new rows when it re-reads.</p>

<p>Dejavu supports a variety of stores, and not every store supports every
isolation level. See the <a href='storage.html#comparison'>comparison chart</a>
for details. Some stores, like shelve and RAM, don't support transactions
at all. In addition, different stores "prevent" the above phenomena in 
different ways. In some cases, the phenomena is simply not allowed to exist.
In other cases, the phenomena raises an error immediately. In still other
cases, the phenomena is prevented by waiting (up to a timeout) until one
of the offending transactions completes.</p>

<p>Once you have finished executing statements, you should call
<tt>flush_all</tt>, which will call <tt class='def'>commit()</tt>
for you. Alternately, you may call <tt class='def'>rollback()</tt>
if you need to ignore your changes.</p>

<p>If you're using a store that supports implicit transactions (also
sometimes called "autocommit"), you can skip calling <tt>start</tt>
by setting the Database attribute <tt class='def'>implicit_trans</tt>
to True (it's False by default). This can be done in code or config.
See the <a href='storage.html#comparison'>comparison chart</a> for
details.</p>


<h3><a name='Querying'>Querying</a></h3>
<p>When you retrieve Units, you often don't want to load the entire set for
a given class. In Dejavu, you filter the set according to the UnitProperty
attributes for each object. Naturally, there must be a way to express
the filter you intend. Dejavu actually provides three ways, all in the
<tt>dejavu.logic</tt> module: <tt>Expression</tt>,
<tt>filter</tt>, and <tt>comparison</tt>.</p>

<h4>The <tt>Expression</tt> class</h4>
<p>Regardless of which technique you use to express your filter, you're
going to end up with a <tt>logic.Expression</tt> object. You can build
an Expression directly, passing a single lambda as an argument:
<pre>>>> from dejavu import logic
>>> import datetime
>>> f = lambda x: x.Date >= datetime.date(2004, 3, 1)
>>> e = logic.Expression(f)
>>> e
logic.Expression(lambda x: x.Date >= datetime.date(2004, 3, 1))</pre>
Neat, eh? I worked hard on that __repr__. ;)</p>

<p>It may be obvious, but we'll be explicit, here. The lambda which you pass
into an Expression must possess a positional argument, which will
always be bound to a Unit instance. In the example above, it's named 'x',
but you can use any name you like. Using lambdas as a base means that we
can simply call <tt>e(unit)</tt>, and receive a boolean
value indicating whether our Unit "passes the test". Attribute lookups on
our 'x' object will apply to Unit Properties for that Unit object.
That is, <tt>x.Date</tt> becomes <tt>unit.Date</tt>.</p>

<p>You can also do fancier things with Expressions (although the vast
majority of the time, you won't need to in order to use Dejavu):</p>
<pre>>>> logic.Expression(lambda x, y, z: "Dave" in x.Name and y.Age > 65)
logic.Expression(lambda x, y, z: ('Dave' in x.Name) and (y.Age > 65))
>>> logic.Expression(lambda *units, **kw: units and
...                  (units[0].Width > units[0].Height or
...                   units[0].Color in kw['Colors']))
logic.Expression(lambda *units, **kw: (units) and
                 ((units[0].Width > units[0].Height) or
                  (units[0].Color in kw['Colors'])))
>>> 
</pre>

<h4>Early binding</h4>
<p>What is not obvious from the above code snippet is perhaps the <b>most
important aspect</b> of Expressions: any globals or cell references (from 
closures) in the supplied lambda get <b>bound early</b>. Compare the
following disassemblies:
<pre>>>> import dis
>>> dis.dis(f)
  1           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)
              3 LOAD_ATTR                1 (Date)
              6 LOAD_GLOBAL              2 (datetime)
              9 LOAD_ATTR                3 (date)
             12 LOAD_CONST               1 (2004)
             15 LOAD_CONST               2 (3)
             18 LOAD_CONST               3 (1)
             21 CALL_FUNCTION            3
             24 COMPARE_OP               5 (>=)
             27 RETURN_VALUE        
>>> dis.dis(e.func)
  1           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)
              3 LOAD_ATTR                1 (Date)
              6 LOAD_CONST               6 (datetime.date(2004, 3, 1))
              9 COMPARE_OP               5 (>=)
             12 RETURN_VALUE        
</pre>
As you can see, the function itself references the global 'datetime' module.
Once we wrap it in the Expression, however, it becomes a constant! Thanks to
Raymond Hettinger for inspiring this solution <a href='#hettinger'>[1]</a>.
Early binding, however, implies two consequences:</p>

<p>First, any globals or cell references must be present in the lambda's
scope when it is passed into Expression(). This is the norm and shouldn't
require too much thought from you when you write Expressions. In the
example above, we simply imported <tt>datetime</tt> as you would expect.</p>

<p>Second, any globals or cell references must <b>also</b> be present in
the <tt>logic</tt> module's globals when the Expression is unpickled.
Pickling occurs when Expressions are sent over sockets, and also if
Expressions are themselves persisted to storage (for example, see
<u>Unit Engines</u>, below). This means your application should inject
globals into the <tt>logic</tt> module. Note that the <tt>logic</tt> module
already tries to import <tt>datetime</tt>, <tt>fixedpoint</tt> and
<tt>decimal</tt>.</p>

<h4>External functions within Expressions</h4>
<p>Dejavu provides additional functions which can be used in Expressions.
For example, you can construct an Expression like:
<pre>logic.Expression(lambda x: x.Size < 3 and x.Date > dejavu.today())</pre>
In this example, the <tt>today()</tt> function breaks convention and is
actually <b>bound late</b>. That is, if you construct this Expression now
and use it six months later, the value of <tt>today()</tt> will change.
Storage Managers "know about" these dejavu functions, and can use them
to build more appropriate queries. Here are the functions supplied by
the <tt>dejavu</tt> module:</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Function</th><th>Late bound?</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>
    <td><tt>icontains(a, b)</tt></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>Case-insensitive test b in a. Note the operand order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><tt>icontainedby(a, b)</tt></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>Case-insensitive test a in b. Note the operand order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><tt>istartswith(a, b)</tt></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>True if a starts with b (case-insensitive), False otherwise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><tt>iendswith(a, b)</tt></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>True if a ends with b (case-insensitive), False otherwise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><tt>ieq(a, b)</tt></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>True if a == b (case-insensitive), False otherwise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><tt>year(value)</tt></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>The year attribute of a date. If value is None, return None.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><tt>month(value)</tt></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>The month attribute of a date. If value is None, return None.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><tt>day(value)</tt></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>The day attribute of a date. If value is None, return None.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><tt>now()</tt></td>
    <td>Y</td>
    <td>datetime.datetime.now()</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><tt>today()</tt></td>
    <td>Y</td>
    <td>datetime.date.today()</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><tt>iscurrentweek(value)</tt></td>
    <td>Y</td>
    <td>If value is in the current week, return True, else False.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>It is possible for you, the application developer, to define your
own external functions by injecting them into the globals of the
<tt>logic</tt> module. For example, <tt>logic.odd = lambda unit:
(unit.num % 2) == 1</tt>. However, because the builtin Storage Managers
are unaware of your new functions, they will not be able to optimize
their use; instead, they will simply retrieve a larger set of objects
from storage, evaluate each one against the function you provide,
and return those Units which match your function. This isn't necessarily
a bad thing; it provides the same functionality as if you wrote the test
inline within your own code. By making that test a logic function, you also
allow it to be stored in Engine <i>rules</i> (see <u>Unit Engines</u>,
below). You may, of course, create your own Storage Manager which
understands your external function (and can translate its logic into,
say, SQL), and thereby achieve end-to-end functionality.</p>

<h4>Using <tt>filter</tt> to form Expressions</h4>
<p>The <tt>logic</tt> module also provides convenient methods to
create common types of Expression objects via the <tt>filter</tt> and
<tt>comparison</tt> factory functions.</p>

<p>The <tt class='def'>filter(**kwargs)</tt> function produces an Expression by taking
the keyword arguments you supply, and rewriting them in lambda form. The 
only operator allowed is therefore the equals '==' operator. For example:
<pre>>>> logic.filter(Type='Cat', Mutation='Atomic')
logic.Expression(lambda x: (x.Type == 'Cat') and (x.Mutation == 'Atomic'))</pre>
</p>

<h4>Using <tt>comparison</tt> to form Expressions</h4>
<p>The <tt class='def'>comparison(attr, cmp_op, criteria)</tt> function allows you to
form Expressions with dynamic operators. This can come in handy when you
are constructing Expressions on the fly from user input. For example, a
search page might prompt users for an attribute name, an operator, and an
operand (the criteria).</p>

<p>Borrowing from <tt>opcode.cmp_op</tt>, the allowed values for our cmp_op
argument are as follows:</p>
<table>
<tr><th>Numeric Value (cmp_op)</th><th>Operator</th></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>&lt;</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>&lt;=</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>==</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>!=</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>&gt;</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>&gt;=</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>in</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>not in</td></tr>
<tr><th colspan='2'>Most SM's only support the following with <tt>None</tt>:</th></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>is</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>is not</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Here's an example of using <tt>comparison</tt>:
<pre>>>> logic.comparison('Name', 3, 'Mr. Kamikaze')
logic.Expression(lambda x: x.Name != 'Mr. Kamikaze')</pre>
Although the comparison function only allows a single comparison at a time,
the resulting Expressions can be combined with the <tt>&</tt> and <tt>|</tt>
operators (described earlier) to produce more complex Expressions.</p>

<h4>Combining Expressions</h4>
<p>Expressions are combinable; by using the <tt>&</tt> operator, the two
expressions are combined with an adjoining logical "and". For example:
<pre>>>> a = logic.Expression(lambda x: x.Size > 3)
>>> b = logic.Expression(lambda x: x.Size <= 15)
>>> c = a & b
>>> c
logic.Expression(lambda x: (x.Size > 3) and (x.Size <= 15))</pre>
The <tt>+</tt> operator works just like the <tt>&</tt> operator. The
<tt>|</tt> operator combines the two Expressions with a logical 'or'.</p>

<p>When you combine two Expressions with dissimilar argument lists,
what happens? The Expression class doesn't really care what the argument 
names are, just their order, so the names might not come out as you might
expect; however, the logic is preserved:</p>

<pre>>>> f = logic.filter(Name='Bruce')
>>> f
logic.Expression(lambda x: x.Name == 'Bruce')
>>> g = logic.Expression(lambda a, b, **kw: a.Name + b.Surname == kw['Full Name'])
>>> 
>>> f + g
logic.Expression(lambda x, b, **kw: (x.Name == 'Bruce')
                 and (x.Name + b.Surname == kw['Full Name']))
>>> g + f
logic.Expression(lambda a, b, **kw: (a.Name + b.Surname == kw['Full Name'])
                 and (a.Name == 'Bruce'))
</pre>

<h4><a name='kwtypes'>Specifying types for Expression kwargs</a></h4>
<p>Up to now, we've constructed Expression objects with a single argument,
the function which we're going to wrap. But Expression objects may take
a second argument, called "kwtypes". This argument must be a dictionary of
{keyword: type} pairs. Dejavu doesn't do anything internally with this
information; it's simply a standard place to keep it for use by your own
applications. However, the kwtypes attribute will be persisted when
pickling and unpickling Expression objects, a very common operation.</p>

<h4>Exporting the <tt>logic</tt> module</h4>
<p>The <tt>logic</tt> module (and <tt>codewalk</tt>, on which it is built)
isn't limited to Dejavu. Feel free to use it in some other framework or
script! The only change you may have to make (if you relocate the module
outside of the <tt>dejavu</tt> package) would be to the single line:
<tt>from dejavu import codewalk</tt>, to point to the new location.</p>

<p>In particular, <tt>logic.Expression</tt> objects can operate on <i>any</i>
Python objects, not just dejavu <tt>Unit</tt> instances. If you wish to
provide additional logic functions (as dejavu does), simply inject them
into <tt>logic</tt>'s globals.</p>

<p>You may also find the underlying <tt>codewalk</tt> module useful for
other purposes on its own. The <tt>Visitor</tt> base class can be very
convenient for building bytecode hacks.</p>

<p>To make a long story short, Dejavu depends on <tt>logic</tt> throughout,
but the reverse is not true.</p>


<h3><a name='Engines'>Unit Engines</a></h3>
<p>Once you've created and associated your Unit classes, you can begin to
write "business logic" code (mostly inside those classes, we hope), and
"presentation logic" code (mostly outside those classes). In most cases,
you will construct Expressions within your own code manually to retrieve
Units. Sometimes, however, you need to persist query parameters from your
users; in other cases, you might store a list of Units which match a query
(regardless of who formed the necessary Expression). Finally, you might
wish to manipulate lists of Units as sets: differences, intersections,
and unions. The <tt>engines</tt> module addresses all of these needs.</p>

<h4>Collections: Lists of Units</h4>
<p>The <tt>UnitCollection</tt> class provides a means of storing a list of
Units, or rather, a list of Unit identifier values. You use its <tt>Type</tt>
property to indicate the class of the indexed Units. That value should be
the <b>name</b> of the Unit Class, <b>not</b> the class object itself
(this is different than most other calls in Dejavu). If you need to
retrieve the actual Unit class, call <tt>UnitCollection().unit_class()</tt>.</p>

<p><tt>UnitCollection</tt> itself subclasses <tt>dejavu.Unit</tt>; you can
therefore persist Unit Collections via Dejavu Storage Managers (most SM's,
anyway; it's recommended that SM's handle Unit Collections, but not
required. Check your SM to see if it does).</p>

<p>Each Collection has a thread lock (an RLock, actually) which you should
<tt class='def'>acquire()</tt> before you add an ID to the set,
and <tt class='def'>release()</tt> afterward. If you use the
<tt class='def'>add(ID)</tt> method, this locking is done
for you.</p>

<p>When you need to retrieve the actual Units which are indexed by the
Collection, call the <tt class='def'>units(quota=None)</tt> method, which
will look up the Units and return them in a list. Since the Collection only
stores identifier values, it is possible that one of the indexed Units may have
been destroyed since the list was built. The <tt>units</tt> method simply
passes over these "phantom" Units. You can inspect the full list of IDs
in the Collection (whether they reference existing Units or not) with
the <tt class='def'>ids()</tt> method.</p>

<p>Collections also provide a convenience function for grouping Units
by attribute: <tt class='def'>xdict(attr)</tt>. This function will look up
each Unit
in the Collection, inspect the attribute that you specify, and return
a dictionary of the form <tt>{attr_val1: [Unit, Unit, ...]}</tt>.
Each distinct attribute value will have its own key, with a list of
matching Units as the value.</p>

<h4>Engines</h4>
<p>You can form Collections by hand, but a more powerful technique is
the <tt>UnitEngine</tt>, a factory for Collections. Engines are very
simple: they possess a set of <i>rules</i> which are executed when
you want to take a <i>snapshot</i> of Units. The snapshot which is
produced is a <tt>UnitCollection</tt> object. Whenever you call
<tt class='def'>take_snapshot()</tt>, the Engine will maintain an association
to the resulting Collection. You can access past snapshots with the
<tt class='def'>snapshots()</tt> method.</p>

<p>Engines are themselves Units, and can be persisted via Storage Managers.
The only properties they possess are: an <tt class='def'>ID</tt>,
a <tt class='def'>Name</tt>, an <tt class='def'>Owner</tt>,
a <tt class='def'>FinalClassName</tt>, and <tt class='def'>Created</tt>,
the creation date of the Engine.</p>

<p>The <tt>Owner</tt> property should either be a user name, or one of the
reserved names: "Public" and "System". By default, the
<tt class='def'>permit()</tt>
method allows a user read-access to the Engine if they are the Owner, or
the Owner is "Public" or "System". Write-access is permitted if the user
is the Owner, or the Owner is "Public". Feel free to override
<tt>permit()</tt> in a subclass to provide different behaviors.</p>

<p>The <tt>FinalClassName</tt> is set for you as you add Rules to the
Engine. You can use the value of this property, for example, to tell
your users, "Engine #23569 is an 'Armadillo' engine," when it produces
Collections of <tt>Armadillo</tt> Units. The only time you might want to
set this value manually is when you first create the Engine, before you
have added any Rules.</p>

<h4><a name='unitenginerules'>Rules</a></h4>
<p>Just like Collections and Engines, <tt>UnitEngineRule</tt> is <i>also</i>
a subclass of <tt>Unit</tt>, and can be persisted via Storage Managers. All
three work together to provide a complete, dynamic, application-level query
generator.</p>

<p>Okay, so what are Rules? You might say they're a "little language",
with the following primitives, or "operations":</p>
<table>
<tr><th>Operation</th><th>Operand(s)</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><th colspan='3'>Operations on a single set</th></tr>
<tr>
    <td>CREATE</td>
    <td>The classname of the new Type</td>
    <td>Creates a new Set of the specified Type. All Units of that Type
        are included in the new Set.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>FILTER</td>
    <td>A <tt>logic.Expression</tt></td>
    <td>Removes Units from the current Set which do not match the
        Expression.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>FUNCTION</td>
    <td>The name of a function in the <tt>Arena.engine_functions</tt>
        dict</td>
    <td>Calls the function, passing the current Set. The function
        should modify the Set.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>TRANSFORM</td>
    <td>The classname of the new Type</td>
    <td>Transform the current Set into a Set of associated Units
        (of another Type). The association must be present in the
        <tt>Arena.associations</tt> graph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>RETURN</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>Optional. If omitted, the last Set handled is returned as the
        snapshot. If supplied, the ID of the Set to return.</td>
</tr>
<tr><th colspan='3'>Operations on two sets</th></tr>
<tr>
    <td>COPY</td>
    <td>The Set ID of the new Set</td>
    <td>Copies the current Set to a new Set. The current Set is unchanged.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>DIFFERENCE</td>
    <td>The ID of the Set to mix in</td>
    <td>Removes IDs from the current Set which exist in the second Set.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>INTERSECTION</td>
    <td>The ID of the Set to mix in</td>
    <td>Removes IDs from the current Set which <i>do not</i> exist in the
        second Set.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>UNION</td>
    <td>The ID of the Set to mix in</td>
    <td>Adds any IDs to the current Set which exist in the second Set.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Each Rule has an <tt>Operation</tt> property (a string, one of the above),
a <tt>SetID</tt>, and an <tt>Operand</tt>. Here's an example ruleset:</p>
<table>
<tr><th>Sequence</th><th>Operation</th><th>SetID</th><th>Operand</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>CREATE</td><td>1</td><td>"Invoice"</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>FILTER</td><td>1</td>
    <td><tt>lambda x: x.Date > dejavu.today()</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>CREATE</td><td>2</td><td>"Inventory"</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>FILTER</td><td>2</td>
    <td><tt>logic.Expression(lambda z: z.ID < 10)</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>TRANSFORM</td><td>2</td><td>"Invoice"</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>DIFFERENCE</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>RETURN</td><td>1</td><td></td></tr>
</table>

<p>As you can see, every Rule operates on a <i>Set</i> of Units. The first
rule is always to CREATE a set, declaring it to contain a certain Type
of Units. In most cases, you will then FILTER that set. If you simply
created a set and then returned it, it would contain all Units of the
declared Type. When you filter a set, however, you remove Units from
the whole which do not match the filter's Expression.</p>

<p>In the example above, we CREATE a second Set so that we can eventually
obtain the DIFFERENCE between Set 1 and Set 2. The second Set contains
Units of a different Type than the first. Once we filter Set 2, we then
TRANSFORM it; for each Inventory Unit, we look up associated Invoice
Units. Then, we find the difference between the two Invoice sets and
RETURN it.</p>

<p>Rules are executed in order according to their <tt>Sequence</tt>
attribute (lowest first). When you use the <tt>Engine.add_rule</tt> method,
the next <tt>Sequence</tt> value is retrieved for you. Notice that each
Rule belongs to one and only one Engine; they are not shared between
Engines. Each Rule has its own <tt>EngineID</tt> attribute.</p>

<h4>Engine Functions</h4>
<p>The FUNCTION rule deserves special mention. The Operand of a FUNCTION
rule is a string, a key in the <tt>Arena.engine_functions</tt> dictionary.
When the rule is executed, that key is used to look up the function, which
is then called, passing <tt>(sandbox, set)</tt>. The function should
mutate the set directly. Use FUNCTION rules to mutate sets in ways which
are more complex than those provided by FILTER and TRANSFORM. For example,
you might provide a function which removes all but the first Unit in the
Set (according to some ordering algorithm).</p>


<h3>Analysis Tools</h3>
<p>Dejavu includes various tools to help you manipulate groups of Units.</p>

<h4>Sorting Units</h4>
<p>When you recall Units, you receive a list. However, the <tt>recall</tt>
method doesn't do any sorting; you must sort your list in your Python code.
Dejavu provides a <tt class='def'>sort(attrs, descending=False)</tt>
function to assist
you in sorting Units. It returns a function, which you can then use in
Python's sort function (which operates in place). Continuing our example:
<pre>people.sort(dejavu.sort('Size', 'Name'))</pre>
The most important issue (and the reason we don't just use 2.4's attrgetter),
is that any Unit property must allow values of None, which tends to raise
errors when compared to values of other types. The function which
<tt>sort</tt> creates for you treats None as "less than" any other value.</p>

<h4>Cross-tabulation</h4>
<p>Cross-tabs (also called <i>aggregate tables</i> or <i>pivot tables</i>)
display aggregate information about objects by category. For example,
rather than show a list of Safari records, one row per trip, you might
wish to show a table where each row represents a Destination, and each
column shows the count of Safaris to that Destination for each distinct
Year. In this example, we say that the Safaris are "grouped by" their
Destination values, and that we "pivot" on the Year values.</p>

<p>Dejavu helps you form such a table via the <tt>CrossTab</tt> class.
You need to specify the group(s) you wish to use, and the pivot attribute.
Finally, you must specify the aggregate function. Here's a code example:
<pre>
>>> data = ["a", "b", "cc", "bddd", "a4", "b6"]
>>> group = lambda x: x.isalpha()
>>> pivot = lambda x: x[0]
>>> ctab = analysis.CrossTab(data, [group], pivot, dejavu.COUNT)
>>> data, columns = ctab.results()
>>> data
{(True,): {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 1},
 (False,): {"a": 1, "b": 1}}
>>> columns
["a", "b", "c"]</pre>
You may notice that we're not using Units in our example; the
<tt>CrossTab</tt> class is designed to work with any objects. Here's one
way to lay out that data:</p>
<table>
<tr><th>Is Alpha</th><th>a</th><th>b</th><th>c</th></tr>
<tr><td>Y</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>N</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The <tt>results</tt> method returns two values. First, the table
itself in the form of a dictionary; each key is a tuple of group values,
and the corresponding value is a sub-dictionary. Each sub-dict has keys
which are the pivot attribute, and values which equal the aggregates.
I know, that was confusing; look at the example. The second value to
be returned is a list of the pivot column values; you'll notice they're
sorted.</p>

<p>The groups and pivot arguments may be either strings or functions.
If strings, they must be the names of attributes of the source objects.
The final aggfunc argument defaults to COUNT, but may also be SUM.
More aggfuncs may arrive in the future.</p>
