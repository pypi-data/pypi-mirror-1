<h2>Deployers: Configuring Storage</h2>

<p>Storage Managers insulate an application developer from the specifics of
databases, query languages, and cache mechanisms. As the <i>deployer</i> of
a Dejavu application, you get to be in control of these specifics. But
don't worry; in the vast majority of cases, you will set up a single
database with just two lines in a configuration file. Often, the
application developer will have already prepared default config files
which you can simply "plug and play". But if you <i>need</i> more control
over your data storage, you have it, without becoming a programmer.</p>


<a name='configuration'><h3>Configuration Files</h3></a>

<p>When you deploy an app built with Dejavu, you must specify Storage
Managers to use for persisting application objects. This is usually
done through an ini-style configuration file. Here's a short example:
<pre>[Junct]
Class: access
Connect: "PROVIDER=MICROSOFT.JET.OLEDB.4.0;DATA SOURCE=D:\data\junct.mdb;"
</pre>
The first line of our example ("[Junct]") names the Storage Manager;
each [section] in your conf file defines a different SM. You can use whatever
name you like here; in this example, we used the name of the application.
The second line tells Dejavu the <i>class</i> of SM we'd like to use.
For most applications, you'll decide which class to use based on the
database you want to use. Our example declares that we want to persist our
application data in an "MS Access" (i.e., Jet) database. The third line in
our example is a standard ADO Connect string. The MS Access class requires
this entry; other SM's may not.</p>

<h4>Common Configuration Entries</h4>
<p>There are a few configuration entries which (probably) apply to all
Storage Managers:</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Key</th><th>Example Value</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>
    <td>Class</td>
    <td><tt>cache</tt>, or <tt>dejavu.storage.CachingProxy</tt></td>
    <td>Which backend to use when instantiating this <tt>StorageManager</tt>.
    You may supply a known short name or the full dotted-package name.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Load Order</td>
    <td><tt>5</tt></td>
    <td>Optional. The order in which to load this SM. Lower numbers are
        loaded first. SM's without a Load Order default to 0.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Shutdown Order</td>
    <td><tt>10</tt></td>
    <td>Optional. The order in which to shut down this SM. Lower numbers are
        shut down first. SM's without a Shutdown Order default to 0.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Units</td>
    <td><tt>[UnitCollection, UnitEngine, UnitEngineRule, FieldDashboardSumSet]</tt></td>
    <td>Optional. Declares which Unit classes to manage with this SM
        (see below).</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The "Units" entry is what you will use to separate application objects
into separate stores (if you need to). The objects in an application which
need to be stored are called "Units", and each Unit is of a certain Unit
class. If you specify a "Units" entry, then only Units of those classes
will be managed by that Storage Manager. If you do <i>not</i> specify such
an entry, then <b>all</b> Units will be handled by that Storage Manager.
This means that only <i>one</i> SM should be missing this entry.</p>

</ul>

<p><b>The Firebird Storage Manager is new and not yet fully thread-safe.
Patches welcome.</b></p>

<h4>Common Database Configuration Entries</h4>
<p>In addition to the above, Storage Managers for databases (probably)
accept these additional options:</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Key</th><th>Example Value</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>
    <td>poolsize</td>
    <td><tt>10</tt></td>
    <td>Optional. Defaults to 10. If nonzero, connections will be pooled
        (up to a total equal to <i>Pool Size</i>). If zero, no pool
        will be used; each statement (!) will use a new connection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Prefix</td>
    <td><tt>myapp_</tt></td>
    <td>Optional. If specified, all tables in the database will have names
    starting with this prefix. If not provided, it defaults to "" (empty).
    This helps if you need to mix Dejavu tables with tables from another
    application. Leave blank if you want no prefix.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Type Adapter</td>
    <td><tt>myapp.storage.FieldTypeAdapterForMyDB</tt></td>
    <td>Optional. The "Type Adapter" is used to map Python types to database
        column types for use in <tt>CREATE TABLE</tt> statements; for
        example, the Python <tt>float</tt> type might be mapped to a
        <tt>REAL</tt> column type. If you don't like the default column
        types which your Storage Manager provides, you can write your own
        adapter and declare its use here. The value should be the full
        dotted package name of the class you wish to use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>To Adapter</td>
    <td><tt>myapp.storage.AdapterToMyDBSQL</tt></td>
    <td>Optional. The "To Adapter" is used to map Python values to database
        values for use in SQL statements; for example, the Python <tt>str</tt>
        type usually needs to be wrapped in quote marks. If you don't like
        the SQL which your Storage Manager generates, you can write your
        own adapter and declare its use here. The value should be the full
        dotted package name of the class you wish to use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>From Adapter</td>
    <td><tt>myapp.storage.AdapterFromMyDB</tt></td>
    <td>Optional. The "From Adapter" is used to map incoming database values
        (i.e., the results of a <tt>SELECT</tt> query) to Python values; for
        example, your database may return a date value as a string, which
        must then be converted to the Python <tt>datetime.date</tt> type.
        If you don't like the default coercions which your Storage Manager
        provides, you can write your own adapter and declare its use here.
        The value should be the full dotted package name of the class you
        wish to use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>default_isolation</td>
    <td><tt>"READ COMMITTED"</tt></td>
    <td>Optional. All database SM's already have a value for this, but you
        can select another if you wish. This value should be a "native value"
        for your database's particular transaction mechanisms. For example,
        PostgreSQL uses ANSI/SQL names like "READ COMMITTED", but Firebird
        uses library constants like <tt>kinterbasdb.isc_tpb_read_committed</tt>.</td>
</tr>
</table>


<a name='other'><h3>Other Storage Managers</h3></a>

<h4>RAM</h4>
<p>Persists Units in RAM; all Units are lost when the process exits.</p>

<h4>Shelve</h4>
<p>Persists Units to shelve-type files. Extremely simple implementation;
everything is pickled. Querying will be slow--every Unit is sucked in
one-by-one and tested in pure Python using <tt>Expression(unit)</tt>.
But for many applications, you don't need heavyweight query tools;
for example, an online forum may only need topic content looked up by ID.
Or small system tables that only get read at startup might benefit.</p>

<p class='warning'><b>Developers note:</b> The shelve implementation in
Dejavu does not use "writeback"; that is, changes you make to data are
stored only in memory until each shelf has its <tt>close</tt> method
called. If <tt>close</tt> is never called, your changes are lost!
The easiest way to ensure that your changes are saved is to call
arena.shutdown() when your app is closing. Since one of the design
goals of Dejavu is to allow deployers to choose which backend to use,
your applications should <i>always</i> guarantee that arena.shutdown()
is called on program exit.</p>

Configuration entries:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Class:</b> "shelve"
        (<tt>dejavu.storage.storeshelve.StorageManagerShelve</tt>)</li>
    <li><b>Path:</b> The file path (directory) in which to place db files.
        Each Unit subclass will get its own file, of the same name as the
        subclass.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Folders</h4>
<p>Persists Units to a filesystem, one folder per class. Each folder
contains subfolders, one per Unit, with the Unit identity as the folder
name. Each of those unit folders contains one file for each Unit
Property. For example:</p>

<pre>
root/
    Album/
    |   78952/
    |       Name.txt
    |       Artist.txt
    Song/
        1372/
        |   AlbumID.txt
        |   Data.mp3
        88/
            AlbumID.txt
            Data.mp3
</pre>

<p>This is an extremely simple implementation; every value that is not
of type <tt>str</tt> is pickled. Querying will be slow--every Unit is
sucked in one-by-one and tested in pure Python.
But for many applications, you don't need heavyweight query tools;
for example, an upload site may only need files looked up by ID.</p>

Configuration entries:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Class:</b> "folders"
        (<tt>dejavu.storage.storeshelve.StorageManagerShelve</tt>)</li>
    <li><b>root:</b> Required. The file path (directory) in which to
        place db files. Each Unit class will get its own subfolder,
        of the same name as the class.</li>
    <li><b>mode:</b> Optional. The mode arg to pass to <tt>os.mkdir</tt>
        when creating folders. Defaults to '0777'.</li>
    <li><b>idsepchar:</b> Optional. The character to use for separating
        unit identities which are multivalent. Defaults to '_' (underscore).
        For example, a Unit with <tt>identifiers = ('Name', 'DOB')</tt>
        would get a folder name like 'Fred_20040321'.</li>
    <li><b>extdefault:</b> Optional. The default file extension to use
        for Unit Property files. Defaults to '.txt'.</li>
    <li><b>&lt;unit&gt;.&lt;propname&gt;:</b> Optional. The value should
        be the file extension for properties of the given propname
        for the given unit class. For example, <tt>Song.Data = .mp3</tt>
        (be sure to include the leading 'dot' if you want one).</li>
</ul>


<a name='middleware'><h3>Middleware</h3></a>

<p>Some Storage Managers act as "middleware", and can be chained together
to provide layered functionality. Consider, for example, the
<tt>CachingProxy</tt> class; it has another Storage Manager
"behind it", which it proxies. It can be used to cache objects between
client connections independently from the underlying, database-specific
Storage Manager. The beauty of this design is that the decision to
use a CachingProxy is completely up to the deployer, <i>not</i> the
application developer. The deployer can separate stores, test response
times, and address other integration concerns on their own systems.</p>

<h4>Caching Proxy</h4>
<p>Use this class to persist Units in memory between client connections.
It must proxy another Storage Manager. Configuration entries:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Class:</b> <tt>dejavu.storage.CachingProxy</tt></li>
    <li><b>Next Store:</b> Required. The name of the next Storage Manager
        in the chain.</li>
    <li><b>Lifetime:</b> Optional. The recurrence string which declares
        how often to sweep Units out of the in-memory cache. The string you
        supply should be one of the following types:
        <ul>
            <li><b>By units (intervals):</b> "3 hours" will run every 3
                hours. "7 days" or "1 week" will run once each week.</li>
            <li><b>Daily:</b> "14:00 each day" will run at 2:00 P.M.
                every day.</li>
            <li><b>Weekly:</b> "Mon", "Monday", or "Mondays" will run once
                each Monday.</li>
            <li><b>Monthly:</b> "20 each month" will run on the 20th of
                each month. "0 every month" will run on the <i>last</i>
                day of each month.</li>
        </ul>
        See the <tt>recur</tt> module for complete options.
    </li>
</ul>


<h4>Burned Proxy</h4>
<p>Use this class to persist Units in memory between client connections.
It needs another Storage Manager to proxy. Unlike the Caching Proxy above,
this Storage Manager recalls all Units at once upon the first request,
and won't recall them again from storage. They are "burned" into memory
for the lifetime of the application. Configuration entries:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Class:</b> <tt>dejavu.storage.BurnedProxy</tt></li>
    <li><b>Next Store:</b> Required. The name of the next Storage Manager
        in the chain.</li>
    <li><b>Lifetime:</b> Optional. The recurrence string which declares
        how often to sweep Units out of the in-memory cache. See the
        Caching Proxy, above, for recurrence string formats. In general,
        you should <b>not</b> set this value for BurnedProxy stores.</li>
</ul>


<a name='comparison'><h3>SM Comparison Chart</h3></a>

<p>When selecting a storage implementation, you should be aware of the
strengths and limitations of each option. The following chart should help
you decide.</p>

<p>First, it shows you which stores do and do not support certain
optional features of Dejavu. Your application developer should provide you
with a list of any features which they <i>require</i>.</p>

<p>Second, it shows you which stores have performance or boundary issues
and where. When developing applications, you should avoid these issues
either by coding alternative solutions, or by recommending to your
deployers that they avoid the problematic stores. Note that some
limitations are inherent in the storage mechanism itself, while some
are limitations of the current Storage Manager for that mechanism.</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Y</b>: The store supports the feature natively.</li>
    <li><b>P</b>: The store does not provide the feature natively, but
        Dejavu provides a fallback in pure Python (which may be slower).
        Boundaries and limitations are therefore Python limits.</li>
    <li><b>N</b>: The store does not allow the feature at all.</li>
    <li>&lt;blank&gt;: Unknown/not yet documented.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name='perfect-dates'>[1]</a> In order to use native date functions in
SQLite, you must be storing your date and time values in one of the
acceptable formats. See the
<a href='http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/wiki?p=DateAndTimeFunctions'>SQLite wiki</a>
for more information. Once you have verified that you are using such a format,
you must then set AdapterToSQLite.using_perfect_dates to True. This can be
done with the configuration entry: <tt>Perfect Dates: True</tt>.</p>

<p><a name='sqlite-alter-table'>[2]</a> SQLite must copy the entire table
to an intermediate table and then to a new, final table in order to alter
tables. Beginning in 3.2.0, adding columns may now be performed natively
(but not renaming or dropping them).</p>

<p><a name='filenames'>[3]</a> The Folders store keeps identifer values and
property names in folder and file names. Not all filesystems support
case-sensitive file/folder names.</p>

<p><a name='ntext-bytes'>[4]</a> Microsoft SQL Server does not allow
comparisons on string fields larger than 8000 characters.</p>

<p><a name='connpool'>[5]</a> Dejavu provides connection pool factories
in pure Python, and does not yet make any attempt to use native pooling
features.</p>

<p><a name='memofields'>[6]</a> Microsoft Access "MEMO" fields have a 1 GB
limit, but so does the entire database. Memo fields also cannot be used as
join keys; set <tt>hints['bytes'] = 255</tt> or less to use VARCHAR instead.</p>

<p><a name='memofields'>[7]</a> Some databases over-protect at various
isolation levels. For example, "REPEATABLE READ" should prevent fuzzy
reads but allow phantoms, but MySQL's and Firebird's REPEATABLE READ
prevent both.
PostgreSQL only uses two isolation levels internally, so that selecting
"READ UNCOMMITTED" behaves like "READ COMMITTED" and "REPEATABLE READ"
behaves like "SERIALIZABLE".</p>

<p><a name='memory-trans'>[8]</a> SQLite <tt>:memory:</tt> databases
cannot use multiple connections, so a single connection is used for
all threads. However, this means that transactions are generally not
allowed for <tt>:memory:</tt> databases when using multiple threads
(because multiple transactions would overlap on the same connection
and not be isolated at all!).</p>
