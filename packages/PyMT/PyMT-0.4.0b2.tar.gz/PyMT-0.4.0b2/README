Introduction
------------

PyMT is a python module for developing multi-touch enabled media rich
applications. Currently the aim is to allow for quick and easy interaction
design and rapid prototype development.

PyMT is written in python, based on OpenGL and supports different input methods
like Mouse, Dual Mouse, TUIO, WiiMote, WM_TOUCH, etc.

PyMT is actively being developed by a community and free to use. It operates on
all major platforms (Linux, OSX, Windows).


Installation
------------

Depending on your operating system you can follow one of the following guides
to install PyMT and the dependencies:

 * http://pymt.txzone.net/wiki/index.php/DevGuide/InstallPymtUbuntu
 * http://pymt.txzone.net/wiki/index.php/DevGuide/InstallPymtMacOSX
 * http://pymt.txzone.net/wiki/index.php/DevGuide/InstallPymtWindows

If you chose to install all the dependencies (see below) yourself, you can invoke
the setup script as follows to install pymt systemwide for python:

  python setup.py install


Dependencies
------------

Since we abstract from the libraries that we use, some dependencies are
optional and may be used instead of others. A list of dependencies and what
we use them for is http://pymt.txzone.net/wiki/index.php/Devel/FeaturesByLibraries

Here is what works best:

  * python (>= 2.6, < 3.0) - http://python.org
  * PyOpenGL
  * Pygame
  * PIL
  * GST + PyGST


Dcoumentation, Examples & Tutorials
-----------------------------------

There is an API reference included in doc/build/html/.
There is some simple example apps in the examples folder that should get
you started for now. Additionally you may want to take a look at our wiki
at http://pymt.txzone.net/wiki/


Configuration
-------------

  [pymt]

  # show/hide fps
  show_fps = (0|1)

  # display event stats at end
  show_eventstats = (0|1)

  # set log level
  log_level = (debug|info|warning|error|critical)

  # detection time of double tap
  double_tap_time = <integer>

  # max distance allowed for double tap
  double_tap_distance = <integer>

  [graphics]

  # activate fullscreen
  fullscreen = (0|1)

  # width of window
  width = <integer>

  # height of window
  height = <integer>

  # force vsync
  vsync = (0|1)

  # force fbo type
  fbo = (hardware|software)

  # display number (use -1 for current display)
  display = <integer>

  # opengl line smooth
  line_smooth = (0|1)

  # opengl polygon smooth (1 can lead to artifac)
  polygon_smooth = (0|1)

  # ignore list
  ignore = [(xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax), ...]

  [input]

  # example of input provider instance
  yourid = providerid,parameters

  # prefix to use for dump
  prefix = <string>

  # format of dump image
  format = <jpeg|png>

  [modules]

  # modulename= to activate a module
  # you can have a list of module with :
