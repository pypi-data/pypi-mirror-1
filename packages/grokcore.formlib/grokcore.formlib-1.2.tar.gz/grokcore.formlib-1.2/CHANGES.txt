Changes
=======

1.2 (2009-07-20)
----------------

* Adapted tests to the grokcore.view split of View and CodeView.

* Fixed forms to use self.template.render() directly instead of using a
  removed private method from grokcore.view.

* Add grok.View permissions for functional tests.

1.1 (2009-01-07)
----------------

* Have GrokForm define an empty actions attribute by default, in order
  for "action-less" forms to work easily.

1.0 (2008-09-25)
----------------

* Created ``grokcore.formlib`` in July 2008 by factoring
  ``zope.formlib``-based components, grokkers and directives out of
  Grok.
