This is a Django application which provides storage classes that use `anyvc`_ 
to commit the uploaded files to one of the following version control systems: 
Bazaar, Mercurial, Git. Besides it's based on Django's usual FileSystemStorage 
backend.

Make sure you've got a current development version of anyvc installed.
