        =========================
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        "In Business Theme" is a theme for Plone
        
        Installation
        
        To install plonetheme.inbusiness into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
        using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:
        
        The buildout way:
        
        1. Unpack plonetheme.inbusiness package to src/ folder of your buildout
        2. Edit your buildout.cfg and add the following information::
        
        [buildout]
        ...
        eggs =
        plonetheme.inbusiness
        
        [instance]
        zcml =
        ...
        plonetheme.inbusiness
        
        The last line tells buildout to generate a zcml snippet that tells
        Zope to configure plonetheme.inbusiness.
        
        If another package depends on the plonetheme.inbusiness egg or includes
        its zcml directly you do not need to specify anything in the buildout
        configuration: buildout will detect this automatically.
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run the ''bin/buildout'',
        which will take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in the Plone interface and click on the
        'Add/Remove Products' link.
        
        Choose the product (check its checkbox) and click the 'Install' button.
        
        Uninstall -- This can be done from the same management screen, but only
        if you installed it from the quick installer.
        
        Note: You may have to empty your browser cache to see the effects of the
        product installation.
        
        
        Features
        
        1. Colors used in theme are customizable using your sites Base Properties.
        
        2. Uses a custom viewlet to display the site's title along with its description.
        Set your site's description and it will appear below the site's title.
