Description: =========
        tl.rename
        =========
        
        ``tl.rename`` is a ``rename`` implementation that does more than substring or
        regular expression replacement. Planned file name transformations include:
        
        - substring replacement as in Gentoo's rename implementation, for example
        - regular expression replacement as seen in Debian's rename implementation
        - reading the new names from a file or standard input
        - various case transformations
        - additional regex replacements inserting formatted counters
        - interactive renaming using readline, if available
        - interactive renaming using an external text editor
        
        Version 0.1 implements reading names from a file or standard input, case
        transformations, simple substring replacement and interactive renaming using
        readline.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        ``rename [options] [file paths]``
        
        File paths may contain directory paths and be either absolute or relative to
        the current working directory. The specified files do not need to exist when
        ``rename`` is called but will cause it to fail if they do not exist when the
        actual renaming is being done.
