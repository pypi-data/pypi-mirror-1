Description: 
        This library includes a client and a server. The client is used to queue
        requests which will be made to mixpanel's API. The server daemon pulls the
        queued items out and sends the requests. Both require a running beanstalkd
        server. You can get beanstalkd from http://xph.us/software/beanstalkd/.
