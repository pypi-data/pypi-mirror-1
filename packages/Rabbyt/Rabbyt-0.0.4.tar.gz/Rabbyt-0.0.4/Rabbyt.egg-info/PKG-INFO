Description: Rabbyt is a sprite library for Python with game development in mind.  It has
        two goals:
        
        1. Be fast, without sacrificing ease of use.
        2. Be easy to use, without sacrificing speed.
        
        I'm following the mantra of "release early, release often."  As such, this is an
        early alpha release and is a little rough.
        
        The only documentation is the docstrings, but together with the examples they
        should get you started.
        
        For a quick rundown on the current features see the website__.
