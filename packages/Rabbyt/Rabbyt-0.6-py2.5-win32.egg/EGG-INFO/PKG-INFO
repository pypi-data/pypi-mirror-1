Description: Rabbyt is a sprite library for Python with game development in mind.  It has
        two goals:
        
        1. Be fast, without sacrificing ease of use.
        2. Be easy to use, without sacrificing speed.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        
        Version 0.6
        -----------
        
        * Sprites can be scaled independently on their x and y axises.
        
        * Added left, right, top, and bottom properties to Sprite.
        
        * Fixed bug with some sprites being drawn upside-down when rotated.
        
        * Fixed c, pyx, and pxd files being installed.
        
        * Added a small function for integrating with the chipmunk/pymunk physics lib.
        
        Version 0.0.5
        -------------
        
        * c source files are included, so Pyrex is not needed for building.
        
        * Renamed the ``DV``\* classes to ``Anim``\*.  (This is mostly internal and
        shouldn't affect anyone.)
        
        * MANY fixes and improvements to font rendering.  (As in, it's actually
        useful now!)
        
        * Lots of docstrings added and improved.
        
        * ``pygame_load_texture()`` now takes ``filter`` and ``mipmap`` arguments,
        which are passed on to ``load_texture()``.
        
        Version 0.0.4
        -------------
        
        * Fixed compiling on MS Windows.
        
        * Added some simple helpers for physics simulation.
        
        * Moved all non-rendering code out of ``Sprite`` and into ``BaseSprite``.
        
        * Added font rendering support.
        
        * Using color data in ``VertexArray`` rendering is now optional.
        
        * ``VertexArray`` can now optionally bind a texture before rendering.
        
        * Fixed a bug with ``VertexArray`` barfing when not given all the data for
        a vertex, instead of using defaults.
        
        * Fixed a segfault when trying to load a texture before initializing the
        OpenGL context.
        
        * Switched ``DVProxy`` and ``DVPyFunc`` to not cache by default.  (Premature
        optimization is the root of all evil.)
        
        * All examples now respond to window events nicely.
        
        
        Version 0.0.3
        -------------
        
        * Added ``DVProxy`` and ``DVPyFunc`` classes.  (Assigning a function to a sprite
        property creates a ``DVPyFunc`` transparently.)
        
        * Added basic arithmetic operations for DV classes.
        
        * Added ``Sprite.attrgetter()`` for super fast property access.
        
        * Changed ``rabbyt.collisions.rdc()`` to not return groups with only one object.
        
        * Added a number of introductory examples, showing the basic features.
        
        Version 0.0.2
        -------------
        
        * Added vertex array rendering.
        
        * Added collision detection.
        
        * Lots of docstrings added/improved.
        
        * Added ``rgb`` property to ``Sprite``.
        
        Version 0.0.1
        -------------
        
        * Initial release!
