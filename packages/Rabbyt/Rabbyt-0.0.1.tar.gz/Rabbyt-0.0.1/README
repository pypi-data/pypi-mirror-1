Rabbyt is a fast 2d sprite library for Python.

I'm following the mantra of "release early, release often."  As such, this is an
early alpha release and is a little rough.

The only documentation is the docstrings, but together with the examples they
should get you started.

I'd really like to hear what people might want out of sprite library.
