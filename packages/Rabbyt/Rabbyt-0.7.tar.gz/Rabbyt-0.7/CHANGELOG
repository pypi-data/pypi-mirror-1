Version 0.7
-----------

* License changed to MIT.

* Added add_time() function.

* Time is stored internally as ``float`` instead of ``int``.  This allows for
  optionally using seconds instead of milliseconds.

* Added exponential, cosine, and sine interpolation.

* Documented rabbyt.anims__ quite a bit better.

* Forced Pyrex version 0.9.5 or greater, to prevent segfaults when using
  weakrefs.  (It still can be compiled without pyrex.)

* Added more hacks for building on MacOS.  Hopefully it'll all go smooth now.

* Deprecated the Basic1 and Basic2 physics classes.

* HTML documentation is now included in the source distribution.

* Added missing documentation for ``VertexArray.texture_id``.

Version 0.6
-----------

* Sprites can be scaled independently on their x and y axises.

* Added left, right, top, and bottom properties to Sprite.

* Fixed bug with some sprites being drawn upside-down when rotated.

* Fixed c, pyx, and pxd files being installed.

* Added a small function for integrating with the chipmunk/pymunk physics lib.

Version 0.0.5
-------------

* c source files are included, so Pyrex is not needed for building.

* Renamed the ``DV``\* classes to ``Anim``\*.  (This is mostly internal and
  shouldn't affect anyone.)

* MANY fixes and improvements to font rendering.  (As in, it's actually
  useful now!)

* Lots of docstrings added and improved.

* ``pygame_load_texture()`` now takes ``filter`` and ``mipmap`` arguments,
  which are passed on to ``load_texture()``.

Version 0.0.4
-------------

* Fixed compiling on MS Windows.

* Added some simple helpers for physics simulation.

* Moved all non-rendering code out of ``Sprite`` and into ``BaseSprite``.

* Added font rendering support.

* Using color data in ``VertexArray`` rendering is now optional.

* ``VertexArray`` can now optionally bind a texture before rendering.

* Fixed a bug with ``VertexArray`` barfing when not given all the data for
  a vertex, instead of using defaults.

* Fixed a segfault when trying to load a texture before initializing the
  OpenGL context.

* Switched ``DVProxy`` and ``DVPyFunc`` to not cache by default.  (Premature
  optimization is the root of all evil.)

* All examples now respond to window events nicely.


Version 0.0.3
-------------

* Added ``DVProxy`` and ``DVPyFunc`` classes.  (Assigning a function to a sprite
  property creates a ``DVPyFunc`` transparently.)

* Added basic arithmetic operations for DV classes.

* Added ``Sprite.attrgetter()`` for super fast property access.

* Changed ``rabbyt.collisions.rdc()`` to not return groups with only one object.

* Added a number of introductory examples, showing the basic features.

Version 0.0.2
-------------

* Added vertex array rendering.

* Added collision detection.

* Lots of docstrings added/improved.

* Added ``rgb`` property to ``Sprite``.

Version 0.0.1
-------------

* Initial release!
