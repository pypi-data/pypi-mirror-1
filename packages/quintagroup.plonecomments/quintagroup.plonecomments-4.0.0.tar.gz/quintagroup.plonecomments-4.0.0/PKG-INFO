        Comments moderation is implemented with involvement of two stage workflow.
        Comments are created in "private" state and visible only to DiscussionManager
        group of users.
        
        To differentiate between logged-in (registered) commentors and Anonymous
        commentors that pretend to be one person or other one, we use Boldness of
        name. The Comment author is in bold when posted by logged in member. The
        names provided when posting Anonymously are in plain text.
        
        Notification subject control allows to enter custom prefix to disctinct
        notifications comming from different sites.

        ===========================
        Installation/Uninstallation
        ===========================
        
        Installation
        ==============
        
        To install quintagroup.plonecomments into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
        using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:
        
        - When you're reading this you have probably already run
        ``easy_install quintagroup.plonecomments``. Find out how to install setuptools
        (and EasyInstall) here:
        http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall
        
        - If you are using Zope 2.9 (not 2.10), get `pythonproducts`_ and install it
        via::
        
        python setup.py install --home /path/to/instance
        
        into your Zope instance.
        
        - Create a file called ``quintagroup.plonecomments-configure.zcml`` in the
        ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
        should only contain this::
        
        <include package="quintagroup.plonecomments" file="configure.zcml" />
        
        - Create a file called ``quintagroup.plonecomments-overrides.zcml`` in the
        ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
        should only contain this::
        
        <include package="quintagroup.plonecomments" file="overrides.zcml" />
        
        .. _pythonproducts: http://plone.org/products/pythonproducts
        
        Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
        recipe to manage your project, you can do this:
        
        - Add ``quintagroup.plonecomments`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
        
        [buildout]
        ...
        eggs =
        ...
        quintagroup.plonecomments
        
        - Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::
        
        [instance]
        recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
        ...
        zcml =
        quintagroup.plonecomments
        quintagroup.plonecomments-overrides
        
        - Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
        
        $ ./bin/buildout
        
        - Install quintagroup.plonecomments via ZMI portal_setup. Select ``quintagroup.plonecomments``
        from the list of available profiles and press *Import all steps*.
        
        **Atention**: If you are using a Plone version **before** 3.1 you need to install
        "plone.browserlayer":http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.browserlayer (which also
        requires a "GenericSetup":http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.GenericSetup version
        greater than 1.4) in your Plone site. It shows up as **Local browser layer support**
        in the Plone Add-on Products Control Panel.
        
        
        Uninstallation
        ==============
        
        - To uninstall quintagroup.plonecomments - select ``quintagroup.plonecomments uninstall``
        profile from the list of available profiles and press *Import all steps*.
