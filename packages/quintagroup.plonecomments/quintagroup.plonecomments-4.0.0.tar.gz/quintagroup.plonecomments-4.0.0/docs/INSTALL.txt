Installation
==============

To install quintagroup.plonecomments into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:

- When you're reading this you have probably already run 
  ``easy_install quintagroup.plonecomments``. Find out how to install setuptools
  (and EasyInstall) here:
  http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall

- If you are using Zope 2.9 (not 2.10), get `pythonproducts`_ and install it 
  via::

    python setup.py install --home /path/to/instance

into your Zope instance.

- Create a file called ``quintagroup.plonecomments-configure.zcml`` in the
  ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
  should only contain this::

    <include package="quintagroup.plonecomments" file="configure.zcml" />

- Create a file called ``quintagroup.plonecomments-overrides.zcml`` in the
  ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
  should only contain this::

    <include package="quintagroup.plonecomments" file="overrides.zcml" />

.. _pythonproducts: http://plone.org/products/pythonproducts

Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

- Add ``quintagroup.plonecomments`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        quintagroup.plonecomments
       
- Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        quintagroup.plonecomments
        quintagroup.plonecomments-overrides
      
- Re-run buildout, e.g. with::

    $ ./bin/buildout

- Install quintagroup.plonecomments via ZMI portal_setup. Select ``quintagroup.plonecomments``
  from the list of available profiles and press *Import all steps*.

  **Atention**: If you are using a Plone version **before** 3.1 you need to install
  "plone.browserlayer":http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.browserlayer (which also
  requires a "GenericSetup":http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.GenericSetup version
  greater than 1.4) in your Plone site. It shows up as **Local browser layer support**
  in the Plone Add-on Products Control Panel.


Uninstallation
==============

- To uninstall quintagroup.plonecomments - select ``quintagroup.plonecomments uninstall``
  profile from the list of available profiles and press *Import all steps*.
