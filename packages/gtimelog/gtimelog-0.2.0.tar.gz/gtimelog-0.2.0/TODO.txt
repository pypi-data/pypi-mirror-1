Minor bugs
----------

Sometimes the log view is repainted incorrectly when you are in grouped view
with a scrollbar, and add an entry for an existing activity.

Midnight handling sometimes acts funny and you need to refresh the view.

Tray icon is not transparent in KDE (reported by Felipe Rafael Prenholato).


Planned refactorings
--------------------

Use GtkStatusIcon (available in gtk 2.10+) instead of EggTrayIcon


Unimplemented features
----------------------

Options dialog.

Re-reading of timelog.txt should be automatic (watch mtime of the file).

History browsing.

Better integration with GNOME (gconf for options, use user's preferred editor
and mailer).

Option to disable time display in tray icon, it doesn't look good on vertical
panels (suggested by Felipe Rafael Prenholato).
