Description: A ``setproctitle`` implementation for Python
        ============================================
        
        :author: Daniele Varrazzo
        
        The library allows a process to change its title (as displayed by system tools
        such as ``ps`` and ``top``).
        
        The procedure is hardly portable across different systems.
        A `good implementation`_ is provided by PostgreSQL_: this module is a wrapper
        around it.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        You can use ``easy_install`` to install the module: to perform a system-wide
        installation use::
        
        sudo easy_install setproctitle
        
        If you are an unprivileged user or you want to limit installation to a local
        environment, you an use the command:
        
        easy_install -d /target/path setproctitle
        
        Notice that ``easy_install`` requires ``/target/path`` to be in your
        ``PYTHONPATH``.
        
        
        Module content
        --------------
        
        ``setproctitle(title)``
        
        Set *title* as the title for the current process.
        
        
        ``getproctitle()``
        
        Return the current process title.
        
        
        Module status
        -------------
        
        Albeit the core part of the code has been tested on a wild variety of
        platforms, the compiling procedure for the Python module has currently been
        tested on GNU/Linux only.
        
        
        Other known implementations and discussions
        -------------------------------------------
        
        - `procname`_: a module with the same function, but less portable and not well
        packaged.
        - `Issue 5672`_: where the introduction of such functionality into the stdlib
        is being discussed.
