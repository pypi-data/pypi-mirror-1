Description: A ``setproctitle`` implementation for Python
        ============================================
        
        :author: Daniele Varrazzo
        
        The library allows a process to change its title (as displayed by system tools
        such as ``ps`` and ``top``).
        
        Changing a process title is mostly useful in multi-process systems, for example
        when using a pool of slave workers whose job is not decided when the process is
        spawned, but later on, after some form of communication from the controlling
        process.
        
        The procedure is hardly portable across different systems.  A `good
        implementation`_ is provided by PostgreSQL_: this module is a wrapper around
        its code.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        You can use ``easy_install`` to install the module: to perform a system-wide
        installation use::
        
        sudo easy_install setproctitle
        
        If you are an unprivileged user or you want to limit installation to a local
        environment, you can use the command::
        
        easy_install -d /target/path setproctitle
        
        Notice that ``easy_install`` requires ``/target/path`` to be in your
        ``PYTHONPATH``.
        
        
        Module content
        --------------
        
        The module exports the following functions:
        
        ``setproctitle(title)``
        Set *title* as the title for the current process.
        
        
        ``getproctitle()``
        Return the current process title.
        
        
        Module status
        -------------
        
        Albeit the core part of the code has been tested on a wild variety of
        platforms, compiling the Python module has currently been tested on:
        
        - GNU/Linux
        - BSD
        - MacOS X
        - Windows
        
        Notice that on Windows there is no way to change the process string.
        What the module does is to create a Named Object whose value can be read
        in tools such as Process Explorer.
        
        
        Other known implementations and discussions
        -------------------------------------------
        
        - `procname`_: a module exposing the same functionality, but less portable
        and not well packaged.
        - `Issue 5672`_: where the introduction of such functionality into the stdlib
        is being discussed.

        Version 0.4
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Module works on BSD (tested on FreeBSD 7.2).
        
        - Module works on Windows. Many thanks to `Develer`_ which provided a neat `GCC
        package for Windows with Python integration`__ that made the Windows porting
        painless.
