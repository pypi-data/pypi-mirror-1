Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The normal Plone 'move' and 'copy' content rules do not take translations of
        the specified target folder into account. Instead, all objects, regardless of
        their language, are moved/copied to the single specified folder.
        
        This product provides two custom Plone Content Rules.
        
        - LinguaMove
        - LinguaCopy
        
        The purpose of which is to move or copy objects to the correct language version
        (translation) of the specified target folder.
