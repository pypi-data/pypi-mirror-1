Description: ``peak.util.assembler`` is a simple bytecode assembler module that handles most
        low-level bytecode generation details like jump offsets, stack size tracking,
        line number table generation, constant and variable name index tracking, etc.
        That way, you can focus your attention on the desired semantics of your
        bytecode instead of on these mechanical issues.
        
        In addition to a low-level opcode-oriented API for directly generating specific
        bytecodes, this module also offers an extensible mini-AST framework for
        generating code from high-level specifications.  This framework does most of
        the work needed to transform tree-like structures into linear bytecode
        instructions, and includes the ability to do compile-time constant folding.
        
        Changes since version 0.0.1:
        
        * Added massive quantities of new documentation and examples
        
        * Full block, loop, and closure support
        
        * High-level functional code generation from trees, with smart labels and
        blocks, constant folding, extensibility, smart local variable names, etc.
        
        * The ``.label()`` method was renamed to ``.here()`` to distinguish it from
        the new smart ``Label`` objects.
        
        * Docs and tests were moved to README.txt instead of assembler.txt
        
        * Added a demo that implements a "switch"-like statement template that shows
        how to extend the code generation system and how to abuse ``END_FINALLY``
        to implement a "computed goto" in bytecode.
        
        * Various bug fixes
        
        There are a few features that aren't tested yet, and not all opcodes may be
        fully supported.  Notably, the following features are still NOT reliably
        supported yet:
        
        * Wide jump addressing (for generated bytecode>64K in size)
        
        * The ``dis()`` module in Python 2.3 has a bug that makes it show incorrect
        line numbers when the difference between two adjacent line numbers is
        greater than 255.  This causes two shallow failures in the current test
        suite when it's run under Python 2.3.
        
        If you find any other issues, please let me know.
        
        Please also keep in mind that this is a work in progress, and the API may
        change if I come up with a better way to do something.
