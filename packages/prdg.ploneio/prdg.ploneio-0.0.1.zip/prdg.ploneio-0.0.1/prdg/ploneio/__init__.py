# TODO: implement an action that shows a form where the user can choose
# the type of the export (HTML, dicts, frozen, etc) and the type of output
# (directory or archive.) This would require the types of export and output
# to be fetched dynamically. Developers should have a way to register their
# custom export and output types (via ZCML).
