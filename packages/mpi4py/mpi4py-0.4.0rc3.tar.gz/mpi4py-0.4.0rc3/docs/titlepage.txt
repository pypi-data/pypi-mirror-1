:Abstract:     This document describes *MPI for Python* package. It
	       provides bindings of the *Message Passing Interface*
	       (MPI) standard for the Python programming language,
	       allowing any Python program to exploit multiple
	       processors.
	       
	       This package is constructed on top of the MPI-1
	       specification and provides an object oriented interface
	       which closely follows MPI-2 C++ bindings. It supports
	       point-to-point (sends, receives) and collective
	       (broadcasts, scatters, gathers) communications of any
	       *picklable* Python object.
