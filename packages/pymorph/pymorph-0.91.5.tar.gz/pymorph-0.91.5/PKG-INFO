Description: Image Morphology Toolbox
        
        The image morphology toolbox implements the basic binary and
        grayscale morphology operations, working with numpy arrays to
        hold image data.
        
        This is a pure Python package which is the companion package
        to the book "Hands-on Morphological Image Processing."
