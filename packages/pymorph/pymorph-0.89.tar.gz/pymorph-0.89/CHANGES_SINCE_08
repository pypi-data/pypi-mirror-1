===========================
Changes Since Version 0.80
===========================

 + Watershed is now implememented. The interface is slightly different: it takes a
    Boolean return_lines parameter instead of the the LINEREG parameter.
    This applies to watershed(), cwatershed

 + numpy is used (instead of Numeric).

 + Function names no longer start with mm.
    A function name  prefix is matlabish and not pythonic.
 
 + No argument names are uppercase anymore. This affects:
    endpoints()
   Use the old mm* for the old argument names

 + Some function names have changed:

   * Over-abbreviated function names:
    clohole -> close_holes
    ero -> erode
    cero -> cerode
    dil -> dilate
    cdil -> cdilate
    sedil -> sedilate
    add4dil -> add4dilate

   * Functions with names that conflict with numpy names:
    int32 -> to_uint32
    uint16 -> to_uint16
    uint8 -> to_uint8
 
 + Some functions were removed:
    * Registration functions
        mminstall, mmversion, mmregister
    * Functions which are easily replaced with array operations
        mmcmp, mmis, mmislesseq, mmstats
    * Other functions which could be replaced
        plot (use matplotlib, for example)

 + Small fixes here and there in the code

 + NEW functions:
    cdist (conditional distance transform)

The pymorph.compat module contains the old names and removed functions. Its use for new code is discouraged
