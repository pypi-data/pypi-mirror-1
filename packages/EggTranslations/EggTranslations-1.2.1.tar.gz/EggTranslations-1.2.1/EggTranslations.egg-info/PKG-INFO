Description: EggTranslations is a flexible object-oriented resource
        loader that is designed to work in projects that are
        distributed as `Python eggs`_. Its main goals are to
        support localization of resources (e.g. images, help
        files and other documentation), and to allow localization
        of text in your application by loading `GNU gettext`_
        ``.mo`` files. However, you don't have to be dealing with
        localizable resources to use EggTranslations: You can
        use it to organize non-localizable resources, too.
