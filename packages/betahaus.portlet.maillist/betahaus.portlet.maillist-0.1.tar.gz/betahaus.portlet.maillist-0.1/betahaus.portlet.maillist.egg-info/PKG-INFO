        Overview
        --------
        
        Subscribe or unsubscribe from maillists
        
        This portlet only sends a mail to a specified address with two different messages in the subject.
        Either subscribe or unsubscribe (both of these can easily be changed to something else)
        
        The from address is the address specified by the user in the portlet, to simulate that it actually
        is the user that is sending the mail.
        
        This is the way Mailman handle subscriptions which is one of many possible backends.
