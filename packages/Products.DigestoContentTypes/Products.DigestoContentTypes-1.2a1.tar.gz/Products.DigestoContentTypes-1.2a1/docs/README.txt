the site install all the dependencies and finally Products.DigestoContentTypes.

A sample buildout can be found in the product's SVN repository:
http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/Products.DigestoContentTypes/buildout. That
buildout can be used to quickly try the product or serve as a base to modify
your own buildout configuration.

$ svn co http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/Products.DigestoContentTypes/buildout digesto
