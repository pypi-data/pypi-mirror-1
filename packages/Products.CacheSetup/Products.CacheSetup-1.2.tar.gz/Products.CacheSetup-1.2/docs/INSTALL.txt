Products.CacheSetup Installation
================================

Products.CacheSetup is the python egg version of the old
CacheSetup product.  The egg version automatically takes
care of installing all the dependancies that make up the
CacheFu bundle.  However, the proxy cache configs must
still be downloaded and configured separately.

References to the "Manual" below refer to the new CacheFu
manual nearing completion as of this release.  Visit the 
official CacheFu site, http://plone.org/products/cachefu, 
for the latest instructions.

Global Install
--------------

To install Products.CacheSetup into the global Python
environment (or a workingenv) using a traditional Zope 2
instance:

 * Run ``easy_install Products.CacheSetup``. 
   Find out how to install setuptools (and EasyInstall) here:
   http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall

 * If you are using Zope 2.9 (not 2.10), get `pythonproducts`_
   and install it into your Zope instance via::

       python setup.py install --home /path/to/instance

.. _pythonproducts: http://plone.org/products/pythonproducts


Local Install (standard buildout install)
-----------------------------------------

To install Products.CacheSetup into the local zope instance
if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project:

 * Add ``Products.CacheSetup`` to the list of eggs to
   install::
 
        [buildout]
        ...
        eggs =
            ...
            Products.CacheSetup
                
  * Re-run buildout::
  
        $ ./bin/buildout


Local Install (old style Product install)
-----------------------------------------

Because its top level python namespace package is called
``Products``, this package can also be installed in Zope 2
as an old style **Zope 2 Product**.

For an old style Product install, move (or symlink) the
``CacheSetup`` folder of this project
(``Products.CacheSetup/Products/CacheSetup``) into the
``Products`` directory of the Zope instance, and restart
the server.

Note that in this case, dependancies are not automatically
installed so you will have to repeat this process for
the rest of the CacheFu bundle: Products.CMFSquidTool,
Products.PageCacheManager, and Products.PolicyHTTPCacheManager.


Post-Installation Steps
-----------------------

If installing for the first time:

 * After starting up Zope, install the CacheSetup product 
   via the Plone "Add/Remove Products" page

 * Optional: Configure via the "Cache Configuration Tool"
   (see Configuring CacheFu in the Manual)

 * Optional: Install and configure Squid or Varnish
   (see below)


If upgrading from a pre-1.2 version:

 * Remove the previous version from the Products 
   directory of the instance.  CacheSetup, CMFSquidTool,
   PageCacheManager, and PolicyHTTPCacheManager have all
   been replaced by Products.CacheSetup, Products.CMFSquidTool,
   etc.  If CacheFu was previously installed in a buildout
   via plone.recipe.distros, then remove the old CacheFu
   settings from this section and re-run buildout.

 * Restart Zope

 * Click on the reinstall link next to the CacheSetup
   product in the Plone "Add/Remove Products" page

 * Note: A reinstall keeps your old pre-1.1 configuration
   in a Cache Policy named "Old Cache Policy".  Any other
   cache policies with ids that conflict with the new ones
   will be backed up and relabeled appropriately

 * Optional: Configure via the "Cache Configuration Tool"
   (see Configuring CacheFu in the Manual)

 * Optional: Install and configure Squid or Varnish
   (see below)

 * IMPORTANT: There is no upgrade path from the pre-1.0
   versions of CacheFu.  In this case, the old CacheFu
   products should be completely uninstalled via the Plone
   "Add/Remove Products" page and then deleted from the
   Products directory of the instance BEFORE installing
   the new version.


Proxy Cache Installation and Configuration
------------------------------------------

Buildout recipes for building and configuring Squid, Varnish,
and Apache are available:

 * http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.recipe.squid

 * http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.recipe.varnish

 * http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.recipe.apache

Previously, the CacheFu bundle also included a collection of
auto-generated proxy configs for Squid, Varnish, and Apache.
Starting with version 1.2, this collection is now maintained
as a separate download found at http://plone.org/products/cachefu
