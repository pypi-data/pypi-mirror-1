Aard Dictionary

Installation Notes
==================

Windows
-------
On Windows earlier than Windows XP SP3 users may need to install
`Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable Package (x86)`_.

.. _Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable Package (x86): http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=32BC1BEE-A3F9-4C13-9C99-220B62A191EE&displaylang=en


User Interface Language
=======================
Currently Aard Dictionary interface is available in English (default) and
Russian. User interface language should be selected automatically
based on system's locale. System settings can be overridden by
starting Aard Dictionary from command line like this::

  $ LANG=ru_RU.UTF-8 aarddict

If specified locale is not available this will result in GTK warning

::

  (process:12326): Gtk-WARNING **: Locale not supported by C library.
	  Using the fallback 'C' locale.

followed by a stack trace and Aard Dictionary will fail to
start. Corresponding locale will need to be installed. For example, in
Ubuntu 9.04 the following command will fix the error::

  $ sudo locale-gen ru


Fonts
=====

Aard Dictionary's JSON article format supports special tag for marking
up phonetic transcription. Font for the article text marked as
phonetic transcription can be assigned through :menuselection:`View
--> Phonetic Font...` menu.  Often phonetic transcription is written
with characters from `International Phonetic Alphabet`_
(IPA). Phonetic transcription in IPA can also be found in many
Wikipedia articles. To have IPA symbols displayed properly you may
want to install one of the excellent IPA fonts available at
http://scripts.sil.org.

You also may need to install additional fonts if you use dictionaries
that use script not available on your system. `WAZU JAPAN's Gallery of
Unicode Fonts`_ is an excellent resource for various unicode fonts.

To install fonts on Maemo simply create ``/home/user/.fonts``
directory and copy font files there. New fonts should now appear in
font selection dialog.

If you don't like or know how to copy font files into
``/home/user/.fonts`` you may install `Doulos SIL Font package`_ with
Maemo Application Manager.

Release Notes
=============

0.7.5

- When article found in multiple dictionaries select tab with article
  from most recently used dictionary (`issue #1`_).

  used.

  articles in serif italic font.

- Implemented links to article sections (`issue #6`_).

  scrolling articles on tablet.

- Fixed handling of articles with multiple tables in same position
  (resulted in application crash on Windows).
