Description: The TimeDuration module provides a Pure Python interface to the creation, manipulation and comparison
        of time duration string.  E.g. if 3:21:45.3 and 3:22:30.1 represent stopwatch times, I don't want
        to represent or store them as datetime objects but I do want to be able to compare them and
        do simple calculations on such string such as find the average of a tuple of TimeDuration objects.
        I'd also like to be able to say something like "3 weeks, 5 days 12 hours and 32 minutes" and be
        able to convert that to minutes, seconds or hours and be able to convert strings that look like
        durations of time to a normalized format.
