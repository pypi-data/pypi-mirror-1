0.2 (2008-10-13)
================

* Add support for rendering fragments at the bottom of the page. When
  you call ``hurry.resource.bottom`` resources which are marked bottom-safe
  will be rendered at the bottom of the web page instead of in the ``<head>``
  section. When you call ``hurry.resource.bottom(force=True)``, *all*
  ``.js`` resources will be included at the bottom.

0.1 (2008-10-11)
================

* Initial public release.
