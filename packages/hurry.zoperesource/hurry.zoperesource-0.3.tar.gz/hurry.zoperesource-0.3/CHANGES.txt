0.3 (2008-12-05)
================

* ``resource.need()`` needed a request object set up in order to
  function.  This is rather annoying in tests, which often don't have
  a request object set up. We now instead return a dummy
  ``NeededResources`` object in such cases (which will then be thrown
  away). As a result, it's always safe to call ``resource.need()``
  during tests, though if no request can be found it will have no
  effect.

0.2 (2008-10-13)
================

* Add support for rendering fragments at the bottom of the page. When
  you call ``hurry.resource.bottom`` resources which are marked bottom-safe
  will be rendered at the bottom of the web page instead of in the ``<head>``
  section. When you call ``hurry.resource.bottom(force=True)``, *all*
  ``.js`` resources will be included at the bottom.

0.1 (2008-10-11)
================

* Initial public release.
