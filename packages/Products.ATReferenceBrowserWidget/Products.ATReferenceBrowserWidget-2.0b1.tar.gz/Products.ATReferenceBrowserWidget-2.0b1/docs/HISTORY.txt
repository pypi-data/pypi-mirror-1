Changelog for ATReferenceBrowserWidget

    (name of developer listed in brackets)

ATReferenceBrowserWidget 2.0b1 - Released March 5, 2007

    - Converted to a regular Python package in the Products namespace.
      [hannosch]

    - Removed lots of BBB code. We require Archetypes 1.5 now.
      [hannosch]

    - Replaced renderAllTheStylesheets with new content provider for inclusion
      of the CSS files.
      [fschulze]

    - Add an option to show all results immediately.
      [alecm]

    - Added .metadata files for the two javascripts to tie them to the
      HTTPCACHE. 
      [reinout]

ATReferenceBrowserWidget 1.7.1 - Released January 16, 2006

    - No longer show all search results by default when allow_browse is off
      because it can be very very slow.
      [alecm]

    - Undid the fix for #5996, because it broke basic functionality.
      [ajung]

ATReferenceBrowserWidget 1.7 - Released December 13, 2006

    - Now the popup also works for multiselect archetypes fields with the id
      content (see comments in referencebrowser_setReference).
      http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5996
      [fRiSi]

    - The widget now tries to sort references on their `order` attribute which
      only exists for orderablereferencefield references. (therefore the
      tal:on-error). This solves http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5995 but
      could be relaced by a condition such as widget/isOrderable as proposed
      in #5995.
      [fRiSi]

    - Fixed simple TAL markup bug which prevented show_review_state from
      working. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5924.
      [hannosch]

1.6 - Released November 4, 2006
===============================

 * listFolderContents requires 'List folder contents' which isn't always
   available, avoid unauthorized errors in these cases by returning []. This
   makes the popup marginally less efficient for some combinations of widget
   parameters.
   [alecm]

 * added 'restrict_browsing_to_startup_directory' property
   [ajung]

1.5 - Released September 8, 2006
================================

 * Fixed incorrect i18n markup.
   [hannosch]

 * Fixed unclickable back and close links in the popup view in IE. This closes
   http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5491.
   [hannosch]

 * Corrected two little XHTML conformance issues.
   [hannosch]

 * Fixed some import locations for AT 1.5 compatibility.
   [hannosch]

 * added 'history_length' property
   [ajung]

1.4 - Released June 1, 2006
===========================

 * added 'only_for_review_states' property.
   [ajung]

 * added support for (optional) 'additionalReferenceInfo' method that can be
   used to add additional information for referencable items.
   [ajung]

1.3 - Released May 15, 2006
===========================

 * Removed empty and unused i18n folder.
   [hannosch]

 * Allow empty queries if there are some other constrains provided and
   allow_browse is false. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5181.
   [hannosch]

 * skins/.../referencebrowser_popup.pt:
   - Changed call to ``here.folderlistingFolderContents()`` back to
     ``here.listFolderContents()`` because this method is not available on
     the ``Plone Site`` object. (so Home did no longer work)

   - Refactored the breadcrumb area to not use REQUEST['PARENTS'] anymore
     and added i18n support (RTL and translation for 'Home')

     REQUEST['PARENTS'] was evil because if did not work out for sites
     that switch the skin by url and manipulate SiteRoot

     (see http://plone.org/documentation/how-to/select-skin-by-url)

   [fRiSi]

  * added 'image_portal_types' and 'image_method' properties. This allows
    you to specify a list of image portal types that are display inside
    the popup widget as images using the 'image_method' (e.g. to show
    images to be referenced as thumbnails)
    [ajung]

  * added 'show_review_state' property
    [ajung]

  * extended functionality of startup_directory property
    [spamsch]

  * added 'allow_sorting' property to order to allow reordering of multiValued
    ReferenceFields
    [ajung]

  * added 'show_path' property
    [ajung]

1.2
================

 * Added a slot for overriding the 'at_url' path to the object, so that the
   widget can be used in scenarios where the path to the relevant object
   isn't so obvious (in Fate for example).
   [alecm]

 * skins/.../referencebrowser_popup.pt:
   Changed call to 'here.listFolderContents()' to
   'here.folderlistingFolderContents()' in order to avoid requiring
   the 'List folder contents' permission on the folder to be browsed.
   [raphael]

 * Made compatible with CMF 2.0 (CMF <= 1.4) isn't supported anymore
   [hannosch]

1.1
================

 * Added handler for the popup
 * Removed duplicate color definition in popup window

1.0.1
================

  * converted templates to own i18n domain (hannosch)
  * fixed an allowed_types_method handling bug
    (http://members.plone.org/collector/4131). (alecm)
  * fieldName may not be the same as field.getName() due to the way
    BaseObject.widget() works.  This strangeness is used to make
    Topics/Criteria work, but makes ATRBW unusable in criteria.  Now it works.
    (alecm)
  * Fixed allowed_types handling so that it respects allowed_types_method, and
    fixed the method handling. (alecm)
  * Fixed some base_query brokenness when allow_browse is enabled. (alecm)
  * added i18n infrastructure (hannosch, naro)
  * added support for CSSRegistry

1.0
================
  * added property (search_catalog) to allow querying of alternate catalogs
    (e.g. CMFMember's member_catalog). (alecm)

  * added message in the popup when adding items in multi-select mode. Thanks
    to Limi.

  * fixed a bug that occured when setting references on objects located
    in the portal root. Thanks to AlecM.

  * Added base_query property which takes a dictionary or method that returns
    a dictionary containing a catalog query to use as a filter (most useful
    with allow_browse disabled).  All portal_type restrictions use this
    mechanism now which allows for proper use of the field property
    allowed_types_method to make the types restrictions dynamic. (alecm)

0.2.1
================
  * fixed problem with portal_factory

  * fixed problem with startup_directory

  * removed automatic install of the demo type.

  * added startup_directory patch from optilude (thanks)


0.2 - 2004-09-09
================

  * added batched view

  * fixed a problem with multiValued

  * added view link that opens the object in a new browser
    window so you can check if that's the object
    you are looking for

  * added 'back' link that does a javascript:history.back()
    so you can return to the browser mode after you've
    done a search.

  * removed possibility to link to the object itself.

  * made the popup window a bit wider and higher

  * modified the 'close window' link. Now sits next to the 'back' link.

  * added startup_directory property for the widget to force another
    startup folder in the portal for the popup window.
