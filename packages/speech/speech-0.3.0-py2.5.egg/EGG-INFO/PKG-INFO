Description: 
        Allows your Windows python program to:
        
        * execute a callback when certain phrases are heard
        
        * execute a callback when any understandable text is heard
        
        * have different callbacks for different groups of phrases
        
        * convert text to speech.
        
        
        
        For this to work, you must first install the Microsoft Speech kit:
        download and run "SpeechSDK51.exe" from http://tinyurl.com/5m6v2
        
        
        Then you can just "import speech" and be on your way!
