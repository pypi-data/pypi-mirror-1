For this module to work, you must first:
1. Install the Microsoft Speech kit: download and run "SpeechSDK51.exe"

2. Then open PythonWin (installable via http://tinyurl.com/5ezco9) and

Very simple usage example:

import speech

speech.say("Hello")

L1 = speech.listenfor(["hello", "goodbye"], lambda phrase, L: print phrase)
L2 = speech.listenforanything(
       lambda txt, listener: if txt == "wow": speech.stoplistening(listener))

while speech.islistening(L2):
  speech.pump_waiting_messages() # each call sleeps .5 secs, so spinloop is OK

speech.stoplistening(L1)
