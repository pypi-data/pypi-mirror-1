* Allow values to be provided thru command line arguments
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zopeproject/+bug/125817

* Need tests!

* README: link to zc.buildout tutorial

* README: document --svn-repository switch and document which stuff
  should/can be checked in and which stuff never should
  (buildout-created stuff).

* zope.conf: Make all paths absolute? Problem: absolue path would be
  checked in. Solution: zope.conf could be created by a simple
  buildout recipe.

* Instead of a --svn-repository, make it a question (with the default
  of no repository == no checkin).

  And if you don't check in on project creation, a tool should allow
  you to do it later (and it should ignore the right files)

* Not only allow the creation of new applications but also the
  deployment of existing applications. Suggested command line usage:

    $ zopeproject app NewApplication
    $ zopeproject deploy ExistingApplication

  Also consider the library use case:

    $ zopeproject library NewLibrary

  And namespaces:

    $ zopeproject library new.library
    $ zopeproject app new.application

* Add Windows service support (a la bin/zopeservice.py from instances)

* Bring back i18nextract and friends

* Add a default overrides.zcml?

* We should be able to use prefer-final=true and drop the find-links
  thing soon

* deploy.ini should be allowed to specify an absolute path of
  zope.conf
