Changes
=======

0.4.1 (2007-09-29)
------------------

* Improvements to ``README.txt`` and ``var/README.txt`` (it was
  pointing to the wrong configuration file).  Moved changelog from
  ``README.txt`` into separate ``CHANGES.txt`` file.

* The ``--no-buildout`` option is no longer ignored now.

* Added a ``bin/python`` script that mimicks an interpreter.

* Enabled the APIDoc tool by default.  You may access it under
  http://localhost:8080/++apidoc++.

* Simplified ``*package*/testing.py``.

0.4 (2007-09-15)
----------------

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added a zdaemon controller script much like zopectl called
  ``*package*-ctl`` (where ``*package*`` is the name of the package
  created with zopeproject).

* Added a debug script called ``*package*-debug`` that configures the
  application and drops into an interpreter session.  It is also
  available via ``*package*-ctl debug``.

* Added ``debug.ini`` which configures a WSGI middleware for
  intercepting exceptions and live debugging (either using Paste's
  evalexception middleware or the Python debugger pdb_).

* Added a functional test layer in ``*package*.testing`` which loads
  the new ``ftesting.zcml``.  Convenience definitions of test suites
  pre-configured for that layer are available in ``*package*.testing``
  as well.

* More improvements to the README.txt file.

Bugfixes and restructuring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Make use of ``zope.app.wsgi.getApplication()`` to reduce the startup
  boiler-plate in ``startup.py`` (formerly ``application.py``).

* The package that zopeproject creates is now located in a ``src``
  directory, where it's easier to single out among the other files and
  directories.

* Fixed a bug when guessing the default eggs-directory: When
  ~/.buildout/default.cfg did not contain an eggs-directory option,
  zopeproject failed with a ConfigParser.NoOptionError.

* Renamed ``application.py`` to ``startup.py`` to make the intent of
  the module much clearer, and to avoid clashes with e.g. Grok (where
  "application" means something else, and ``app.py`` is commonly used
  for the application object).

* The eggs directory will no longer be written to ``buildout.cfg`` if
  it is the same as the buildout default in
  ``~/.buidout/default.cfg``.

* Cleaned up and enhanced the dependencies of the generated
  application.  It no longer depends on zope.app.securitypolicy, only
  the deployment (``site.zcml``) does.  Obsolete dependencies (and
  their include statements in ZCML) have been removed.
  ``zope.app.catalog`` and friends have been added as a convenience.

0.3.2 (2007-07-17)
------------------

* If the user already has a default eggs directory set in
  ``~/.buildout/default.cfg``, it is used as the default value for the
  eggs directory.

* Greatly improved the README.txt file.

0.3.1 (2007-07-15)
------------------

* The ``buildout.cfg`` template was missing settings for the shared
  eggs directory and thew ``newest`` flag.

* Assemble the default path for the eggs directory in a
  Windows-friendly way.

0.3 (2007-07-14)
----------------

* Renamed to ``zopeproject``.

* Incorporated much of the grokproject_ 0.5.x infrastructure.  This
  makes it much more robust, especially when launching zc.buildout.

* Merged ``make-zope-app`` and ``deploy-zope-app`` back into one
  command: ``zopeproject``.

0.2 (2007-07-12)
-----------------

* Renamed to ``make-zope-app``.

* Split ``mkzopeapp`` into two commands: ``make-zope-app`` and
  ``deploy-zope-app``.

* No longer use ``zope.paste`` for the application factory.  Instead,
  each application that's created from the skeleton defines its own
  factory (which is reasonably small and gains flexibility).

* Get rid of the ``start<<Project>>`` script.  Simply use ``bin/paster
  serve deploy.ini`` for starting the server.

* Use the ``Paste#http`` server by default.

0.1 (2007-07-06)
