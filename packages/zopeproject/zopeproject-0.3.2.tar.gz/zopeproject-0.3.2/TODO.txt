* zc.buildout has a logging initialization bug (it doesn't tear down
  the logging handler, so subsequent logging calls are multiplied).
  See https://bugs.launchpad.net/zc.buildout/+bug/125729.

* Allow values to be provided thru command line arguments
  See https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/125817.

* Maybe rename application.py to app_factory.py or something like
  that? (application.py sort of collides with grok's app.py)

* ftesting.zcml and testing.py

* Need tests!
