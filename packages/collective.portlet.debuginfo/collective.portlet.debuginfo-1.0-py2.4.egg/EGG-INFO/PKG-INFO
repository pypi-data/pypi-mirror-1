Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This is a standalone portlet for Plone which can display some useful
        information about the currently logged user at a current context like
        userinfo, user roles, user permissions or context's attributes/methods.
        
        After installing the package through Quick Installer, go to the manage
        portlets view and add a new portlet "Debug Info Portlet". Portlet add/edit
        form allows you to configure a lot of stuff which is hopefully self
        explanatory.
