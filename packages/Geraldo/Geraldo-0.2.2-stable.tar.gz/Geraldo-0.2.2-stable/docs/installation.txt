Installation
============

Geraldo is still not available as installer or system package. So, you have two
ways to install it:

Option 1. Get the latest official version
-----------------------------------------

1. Get the latest tarball available from:

    http://django-plus.googlecode.com/files/geraldo-latest.tar.gz
    
2. Then you can do the following steps to install it:

**Linux**

::
    
    tar xvfz geraldo-latest.tar.gz
    cd geraldo
    sudo python setup.py install

This will copy Geraldo's packages inside Python packages path.

**Windows**

If you are using Windows, Geraldo is fully compatible. You just have to use a
tarball uncompress tool, like **7-Zip** you can download from:

    http://www.7-zip.org/download.html
    

Once you have a tool to uncompress tarball files, you have to uncompress it,
open a MS-DOS Prompty window in the folder you uncompress into and run the
following command:

::

    python setup.py install
    

Option 2. Get the latest development version
--------------------------------------------

Our version control is centralized on GitHub Social repository, in the
following URL:

::

    http://github.com/marinho/django-geraldo
    

To get the latest development version from repository server, you will need for
Git version control system. Then you can run the following command in Shell or
MS-DOS Prompty window:

::

    git clone git://github.com/marinho/django-geraldo.git
    

A folder named **django-geraldo** will be in your current path with all
Geraldo files inside.

Then you can go ahead and use the same commands from **Option 1** to install
in your system.

Dependencies
------------

This is required, there is no chance you use Geraldo with no ReportLab
installed.

Geraldo depends on PIL for works with Images manipulation on the canvas. If you
aren't going to use them, you can live without PIL.
