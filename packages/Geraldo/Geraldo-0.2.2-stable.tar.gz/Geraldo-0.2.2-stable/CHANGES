2009-02-01: Version 0.2.2-stable
--------------------------------
* Fixed setup.py to not require PIL and ReportLab from PyPI
* All band classes are transformed in objects on objects initializations. This
  is important to work with inheritance, and it is important to make a future
  important thing: events (specially BeforePrint and AfterPrint events)
* Fixed test of MatPlotLib support

2009-01-23: Version 0.2-alpha(4)
--------------------------------
* Removed all Django dependecy. Now when use '%(now:)s' macro in SystemField
  instances you have to use Python date formatting standards.

* Fixed PDF generator to set some report reference instances to graphic
  elements. This is important to make graphic elements in a detail band.

* graphics.Image with a new attribute 'get_image' to set manually functions
  to return image instead of load from PIL object or image. This is important
  to show images and charts depending on object values and logic.

* Added support to border in Report class to make borders around the margin.
