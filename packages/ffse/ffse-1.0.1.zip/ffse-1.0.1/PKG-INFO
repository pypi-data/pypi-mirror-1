Description: Firefox Session Editor (FFSE) is a utility to delete entries from
        the Firefox web browser's session store.  The most common reason
        to do this is because you have stumbled upon a page which crashes
        Firefox as soon as your session is restored.  Firefox only gives
        you the option of erasing your entire session when this happens.
