Already written: A Django file storage adapter. Kept closed because it's not
polished. If there's a huge demand, I'll most likely publish it.

Deleting buckets? Creating buckets? These are both fairly simple to implement,
but they somehow feel outside of the scope of a simple API.

Perhaps some unittests.

Perhaps a CLI รก la FTP.

Some way to stream upload files, using Transfer-Encoding: chunked. This would
mean skipping urllib2 for that request entirely, as it's simply incompatible.
