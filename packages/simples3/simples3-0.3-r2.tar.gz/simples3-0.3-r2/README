`simples3` is a fairly simple, decently quick interface to Amazon's S3 storage
service.

It grew out of frustration with other libraries that were either written too
pragmatically (slow), too bloatedly, or just half-done.

The module aims for:

 * simplicity,
 * decent speed,
 * non-intrusiveness.

It really is designed to fit into programmer memory. The three basic operations
are as easy as with dictionaries.

Out of simplicity comes no dependencies - the code relies solely on Python
standard libraries.

The perhaps greatest setback is that it requires Python 2.5, or Python 2.6. No
attempt to backport to Python 2.4 will ever be made, because: it's old.
