`simples3` is a fairly simple, decently quick interface to Amazon's S3 storage
service.

It grew out of frustration with other libraries that were either written too
pragmatically (slow), too bloatedly, or just half-done.

The module aims for:

 * simplicity,
 * decent speed,
 * non-intrusiveness.

It really is designed to fit into programmer memory. The three basic operations
are as easy as with dictionaries.

Out of simplicity comes no dependencies - the code relies solely on Python
standard libraries.

The perhaps greatest setback is that it requires Python 2.5, or Python 2.6. No
attempt to backport to Python 2.4 will ever be made, because: it's old.

== Changes in simples3 0.3 ==

 * Add a `url_for` method on buckets which lets you use expiring URLs. Thanks to Pavel Repin.
 * Much better test coverage.
 * simples3 now works on Python 2.6's mimetypes module.
