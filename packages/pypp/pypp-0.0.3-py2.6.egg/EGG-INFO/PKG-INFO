Description: 
        Benefits
        ========
        
        The primary benefit of pypp is improved readability of source code.
        Furthermore, the template engine provides powerful macro functionality which helps save keystrokes whilst coding.
        
        Features
        ========
        
        * Ease of use: just one import statement
        * No additional file to declare nor any change in file extension required
        * Once compilation is done, no runtime overhead
        * Freshness check: compilation is only performed upon changes to source files
        * Based on the Mako_ template engine
        
        Drawbacks
        =========
        
        * Increases start-up time
        * Some template constructs confuse source code editor syntax highlight functionality
        
        Changelog
        ---------
        **0.0.3**
        
        * Added 'freshness' check in order to save recompiles
        * Removed debug print statements
        
        
        **0.0.2**
        
        * disabled template caching: (1) pypp is not optimizing start-up time (2) runtime time resources are optimized
