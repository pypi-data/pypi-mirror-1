Introduction
============

This product lets you add 360 degree panoramic photos to your website by tagging
your image in the WYSIWYG editor. The image will be tagged with the "roundabout"
class which is converted into a viewer using jQuery when the page is displayed.

The viewer is javascript only, so plugins like flash are not needed. At the
moment only single photos are supported but creating a virtual tour using
multiple photos is in the works.
