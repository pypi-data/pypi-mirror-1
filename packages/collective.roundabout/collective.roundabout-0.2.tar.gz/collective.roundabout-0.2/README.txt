Introduction
============

This product lets you add 360 degree panoramic photos to your website by tagging
your image in the WYSIWYG editor (TinyMCE and Kupu supported). The image will be
tagged with the "roundabout" class which is converted into a viewer using
jQuery when the page is displayed. The viewer is javascript only, so plugins
like flash are not needed.

This product also has a couple of contenttypes which you can use to create a
virtual tour of multiple panoramic photos. This tour includes one (or more)
overview maps and a compass at the current location.
