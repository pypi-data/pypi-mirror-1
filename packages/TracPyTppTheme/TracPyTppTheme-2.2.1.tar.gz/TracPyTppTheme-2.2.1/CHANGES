
What's new in version 2.2.1
---------------------------

- This version goes for fans of continuous pages. It provides better control
  for page width adding scroll bars when content doesn't fit in the page. 
  But there is no vertical overflow, hence contents are scrolled and there 
  is no fixed elements (i.e. banners, metanav, mainnav, ctxnav).

What's new in version 2.2.0
---------------------------

- Now Wiki page contents are displayed correctly in MS IE. This browser is 
  extremely buggy and it doesn't handle the `float` property appropriately.

- Wiki pages include drop-caps. White letters are diplayed on a dark-green 
  background. Some pages are not rendered correctly, but the following changes 
  can be done to revert that.
