Description: Summary
        -------
        The `keyword` cube provides classification by using hierarchies of keywords to
        classify content.
        
        There is two types of keywords:
        
        - `Keyword` which contains a description,
        - `CodeKeyword` which contains the keyword description and the
        associated code.
        
        In order to link an entity to a keyword, you have to add a relation
        `applied_to` in the schema.
        
        Each keyword has the `subkeyword_of` relation definition. This allows
        to navigate in the classification without a Modified Preorder Tree
        Traversal representation of the data.
        
        Some methods are defined in order to get parents and children or get
        the status of a keyword (leaf or root).
        
        See also cubicweb-tag as another (simpler) way to classify content.
