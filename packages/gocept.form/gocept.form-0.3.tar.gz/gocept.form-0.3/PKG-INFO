Description: ===========
        gocept.form
        ===========
        
        `gocept.form` provides some extended functionality for zope.formlib.
        
        Currently it only contains `grouped`.
        
        
        Destructive Actions
        ===================
        
        Destructive actions allow marking actions that can potentially cause harm.
        Those actions will be rendered as buttons and - on JavaScript-capable
        platforms - be disabled by default. Additionally a checkbox is rendered that
        allows enabling the corresponding button.
        
        
        Grouped Fields
        ==============
        
        gocept.form.grouped provides a very low-tech way of grouping schema fields
        into field sets. The styling is applied only via CSS.
