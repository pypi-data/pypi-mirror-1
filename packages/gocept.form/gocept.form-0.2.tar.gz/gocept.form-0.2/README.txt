===========
gocept.form
===========

`gocept.form` provides some extended functionality for zope.formlib.

Currently it only contains `grouped`.


Grouped Fields
==============

gocept.form.grouped provides a very low-tech way of grouping schema fields
into field sets. The styling is applied only via CSS.
