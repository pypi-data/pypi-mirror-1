Description: ===========
        gocept.form
        ===========
        
        `gocept.form` provides some extended functionality for zope.formlib.
        
        Currently it only contains `grouped`.
        
        
        Grouped Fields
        ==============
        
        gocept.form.grouped provides a very low-tech way of grouping schema fields
        into field sets. The styling is applied only via CSS.
