Description: 
        This module implements a realtime sound mixer suitable for use in
        games or other audio applications.  It supports loading sounds in
        uncompressed WAV format.  It can mix several sounds together during
        playback.  The volume and position of each sound can be finely
        controlled.  Samples can also be looped any number of times.  Looping
        is accurate down to a single sample, so well designed loops will play
        seamlessly without clicks or pops.  In addition, the mixer supports
        audio input during playback (if supported in pyaudio with your sound
        card).
