Description: 
        This module implements a realtime sound mixer suitable for use in
        games or other audio applications.  It supports loading sounds in
        uncompressed WAV format and also MP3 format.  It can mix several
        sounds together during playback.  The volume and position of each
        sound can be finely controlled.  Sounds are automatically resampled
        and stereo converted for correct playback.  Samples can also be looped
        any number of times.  Longer sounds can be streamed from a file to
        save memory.  In addition, the mixer supports audio input during
        playback (if supported in pyaudio with your sound card).
