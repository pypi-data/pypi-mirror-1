============================
plone.app.contentrules to-do
============================

 Immediate tasks
 ---------------
  
  - Triggers: Discussion item added
  - Actions: Send email
    
  - Templates have lots of inline styles - this needs to be cleaned up!
  - Buttons for elements in the @@manage-elements view look funny

  - Tests for event handling, including active/inactive checks
        
 Design
 ------
  
  - Consider option for making conditions "any" rather than "all"
      - Would need a switch at the plone.contentrules level and corresponding
        changes to the default rule executor
