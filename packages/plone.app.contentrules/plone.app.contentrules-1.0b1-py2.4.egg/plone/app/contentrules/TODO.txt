============================
plone.app.contentrules to-do
============================

 Immediate tasks
 ---------------
  
  - Need events to remove assignments when a rule is removed, keep track of
    references to assignments in rules.
  
  - Triggers on: Workflow transition, Discussion item added
  - Condiitons: Workflow transition was ...
  - Actions: Send email
  
  - Make a better name chooser for rules
    
  - Templates have lots of inline styles - this needs to be cleaned up!
  - Buttons for elements in the @@manage-elements view look funny

  - Tests for event handling
        
 Design
 ------
  
  - Consider option for making conditions "any" rather than "all"
      - Would imply that conditions and actions be strongly separated at
        the plone.contentrules level.
