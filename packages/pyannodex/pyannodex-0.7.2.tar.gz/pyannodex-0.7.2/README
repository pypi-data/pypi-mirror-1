pyannodex - a Python wrapper for the annodex libraries

Annodex is available at http://www.annodex.org

To build, you need the distutils package, availible from
http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/download.html (it comes with
Python 2.0). Run "python setup.py build" to build and then as root run
"python setup.py install". You may need to run the config_unix.py
script, passing it a --prefix value if you've installed your annodex
stuff someplace weird. Alternately, you can just create a file called
"Setup" and put in values for annodex_include_dir, annodex_lib_dir,
and annodex_libs. The file format for Setup is:

key = value

with one pair per line.
