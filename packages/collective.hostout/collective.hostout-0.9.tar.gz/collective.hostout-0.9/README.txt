
collective.hostout is a zc.buildout recipe to help deploy your buildout.
You can use it to create a hosting environment for your local buildout and then repeatedly
deploy your buildout and custom code to that host. It uses Plone Unified installer to prepare 
the host and fabric for controlling the host.
