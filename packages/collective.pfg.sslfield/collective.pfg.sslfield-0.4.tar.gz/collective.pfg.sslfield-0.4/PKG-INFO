Description: ============
        PFGSSLFields
        ============
        
        This product adds a new field to use with `PloneFormGen`_, a user-configurable form creation product for `Plone`_.
        
        Install this egg to your zope instance, install it with quickinstaller and you will have another field to add to your `PloneFormGen`_ forms: **ssl string field**.
        
        This field is able to extract the value to populate itself from the request, looking at the SSL variable configured when creating the field. In this way, you can use a digital certificate in your browser, and this field will use the values in the certificate to fill the form.
        
        
        Requisites
        ==========
        
        To be able to extract the values of SSL variables, you will have to configure the SSL certificate in your webserver and configure it to ask for client verification.
        
        If you are using `Apache`_ as webserver, you can use `mod_mustap`_ to configure Apache to pass SSL variables to Zope instead of using mod_headers to get the value of SSL variables. Zope doesn't (or at least, I couldn't) get the SSL variables from Apache, so this step is needed.
        
        You can read the file APACHE.txt for samples of Apache configuration.
        
        SSL Variables
        =============
        
        The SSL variables you can get info from using this field, are the ones defined in Apache's `mod_ssl`_ documentation.
