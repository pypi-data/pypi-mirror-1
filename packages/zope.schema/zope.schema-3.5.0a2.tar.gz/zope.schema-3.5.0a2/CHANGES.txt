=========

3.5.0a2 (2008/12/11)
--------------------

- Move zope.testing to "test" extras_require, as it is not needed
  for zope.schema itself.

- Change the order of classes in SET_TYPES tuple, introduced in
  previous release to one that was in 3.4 (SetType, set), because
  third-party code could be dependent on that order. The one
  example is z3c.form's converter.

3.5.0a1 (2008/10/10)
--------------------

- Added the doctests to the long description.

- Removed use of deprecated 'sets' module when running under Python 2.6.

- Removed spurious doctest failure when running under Python 2.6.

- Added support to bootstrap on Jython.

- Added helper methods for schema validation: ``getValidationErrors``
  and ``getSchemaValidationErrors``.

- zope.schema now works on Python2.5
