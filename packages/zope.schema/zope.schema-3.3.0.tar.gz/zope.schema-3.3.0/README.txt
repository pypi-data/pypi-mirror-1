Schemas extend the notion of interfaces to detailed descriptions of
Attributes (but not methods).  Every schema is an interface and
specifies the public fields of an object.  A *field* roughly
corresponds to an attribute of a python object.  But a Field provides
space for at least a title and a description.  It can also constrain
its value and provide a validation method.  Besides you can optionally
specify characteristics such as its value being read-only or not
required.

See 'src/zope/schema/README.txt' for more information.
