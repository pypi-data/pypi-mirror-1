Description: 
        installation:
        
        - easy_install pyRadKDE
        
        setup:
        
        - Add a mouse gesture for "pyrad.py": go into KDE systemsettings -> keyboard shortcuts -> add a gesture with the action "pyrad.py" (you might have to enable gestures in the settings, too - in the shortcuts-window you should find a settings button).
        - customize the menu by editing the file "~/.pyradrc" or right-clicking items.
        
        Alternate setup with dbus (much faster but incomplete):
        
        - Add "/usr/bin/pyrad.py" as script to your autostart (systemsettings->advanced->autostart) TODO: make it not show the GUI
        - Add the mouse gesture to call D-Bus: Program: org.kde.pyRad ; Object: /MainApplication ; Function: newInstance
        - Alternately set the gesture to call the command "dbus-send --type=method_call --dest=org.kde.pyRad /MainApplication org.kde.KUniqueApplication.newInstance"
        
        
        usage:
        
        - Just use your gesture to call up the command wheel when you want to call one of your included programs.
        - Right-click an item to edit it. Middle-click an item to add a new one after it (clockwise).
        - Make folders by using the action [("kreversi", None), ("icon", "action"), ("icon2", "action2"), ...].
        Actions are simply the commands you'd use on the commandline.
        - call "pyrad.py --quit" to shutdown the process in the background. "pyrad.py --help" shows the usage. "pyrad.py --daemon" starts pyRad without showing the GUI.
        
        
        plan:
        
        - new command scheme: right-click always edits, middle-click adds a new item. -done
        - items arranged clockwise. -done
        - right-click on center opens a general config dialog. -todo
        - a general config dialog. -todo
        - first run of new version shows image as usage guide. -todo
        - Edit dialog should show the icon graphically. A click on the item should show the edit dialog we have when editing the K-Menu. -todo
        - Edit dialog should have a radio button for the action: "create folder". -todo
        - register a global shortcut / gesture in KDE from within the program -> usable as soon as it's installed. -todo
        - make it show faster. -todo
        - add option --only-daemon to only start the daemon without showing the GUI
        
        ideas:
        
        - use plasma.
        - Show the program cathegories from the K-Menu.
        - Get the folders and actions from Nepomuk somehow -> favorites or such.
        - Option to have an auto-optimizing wheel layout :)
        - adjust icon size to the number of icons in the circle.
        - Adjust circle radius to the number of icons.
        - Show the icons inside a folder over/around the folder icon.
        - Add a CLI fallback, so people can also access their actions via the shell.
        - Talk to DBus directly (for higher performance). -> dbus-send --type=method_call --dest=org.kde.pyRad /MainApplication org.kde.KUniqueApplication.newInstance

        pyRad Changelog
        ===============
        
        pyRad 0.3.2
        
        - Added --daemon argument to start pyRad without showing the wheel.
        
        pyRad 0.3.1
        
        - FIX: Upper level changes weren't saved.
        
        pyRad 0.3
        
        - Largescale rewrite in the battle for startup performance. It's now a KUniqueApplication and after the first run, subsequent runs only call the already running (but hidden) instance. Still the imports take the major share of the startup time.
        - New command scheme: Right-click always edits the item, middle click adds a new item after the clicked one.
        - Items are arranged clockwise.
        - FIX: Changes in the layout were only effective after the next start. Now changes take effect immediately.
        
        pyRad 0.2
        
        - Right-click on an item opens an edit dialog.
        - Changes are saved directly to the .pyradrc
        
        pyRad 0.1.1
        
        - moved the Rad class into a seperate file (rad.py) - same performance but cleaner.
        - added a version header to the .pyradrc file, so it will be possible to update it transparently when changes should be necessary.
        
        pyRad 0.1
        
        - Initial version.
