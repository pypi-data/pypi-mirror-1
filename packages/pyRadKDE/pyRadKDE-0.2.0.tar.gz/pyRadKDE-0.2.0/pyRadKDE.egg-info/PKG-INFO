Description: 
        installation and setup:
        
        - easy_install pyRadKDE
        - go into KDE systemsettings -> keyboard shortcuts
        - add a gesture with the action "pyrad.py"
        - you might have to enable gestures in the settings, too (in the shortcut-window you should find a settings button).
        - customize the menu by editing the file "~/.pyradrc"
        
        usage:
        
        - Just use your gesture to call up the command wheel when you want to call one of your included programs.
        - Right-click an item to edit it. Right-click the center to add a new item.
        - Make folders by using the action [("kreversi", None), ("icon", "action"), ("icon2", "action2"), ...]
        - Actions are simply the commands you'd use on the commandline.
        
        plan:
        
        - Initialize a window at mouse position (QCursor::pos(); QLayoutItem::setGeometry(Qrect)) -done
        - Make the window transparent, without background, border and menubar. -done
        - Show icons in a circle  -done
        - make the icons clickable  -done
        - add folder-icons: the action is simply a list with all contained items => starts with [  -done
        - store the previous layout (buttons) directly in the name of the central icon => same list format.  -done
        
        - register a global shortcut / gesture in KDE from within the program -> usable as soon as it's installed. -todo
        
        
        ideas:
        
        - use plasma.
        - Add a pyRadEdit script in which people can edit the items in a wheel type layout. Maybe add a button or similar to switch to edit mode. Or edit with right-click (right-click the center to add an item).
        - Show the program cathegories from the K-Menu.
        - Get the folders and actions from Nepomuk somehow -> favorites or such.
        - Option to have an auto-optimizing wheel layout :)

        Changelog:
        
        pyRad 0.2
        
        - Right-click on an item opens an edit dialog.
        - Changes are saved directly to the .pyradrc
        
        pyRad 0.1.1
        
        - moved the Rad class into a seperate file (rad.py) - same performance but cleaner.
        - added a version header to the .pyradrc file, so it will be possible to update it transparently when changes should be necessary.
        
        pyRad 0.1
        
        - Initial version.
