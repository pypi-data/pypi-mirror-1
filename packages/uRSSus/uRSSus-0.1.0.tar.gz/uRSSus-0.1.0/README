Licensing
---------

Urssus is licensed under the GPL v2 (read COPYING).

The included icons are form the Reinhardt KDE icon set, and they are licensed
under the LGPL (read COPYING.LGPL).

The image of a bear is Creative Commons, used with permission and attribution.

Different modules have different licenses and authors, read each if you need to 
find out, but they all should be GPL-compatible.

Requirements
------------

* I have only tested this with Elixir 0.5.2 and SQLAlchemy 0.4.6.

* If you got this from SVN and not a source tarball, you are missing files.

  You can generate them using setup.py:

    python setup.py compile_resource compile_ui

  Those commands require a working PyQt 4.4 (at least) developing environment.

If you have no idea what I'm talking about, use a package instead of SVN ;-)
