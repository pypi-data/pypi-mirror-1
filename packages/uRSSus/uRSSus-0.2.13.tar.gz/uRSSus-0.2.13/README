Licensing
---------

Urssus is licensed under the GPL v2 (read COPYING).

The included icons are form the Reinhardt KDE icon set, and they are licensed
under the LGPL (read COPYING.LGPL).

The image of a bear is Creative Commons, used with permission and attribution.

Different modules have different licenses and authors, read each if you need to 
find out, but they all should be GPL-compatible.

Installation
------------

Hopefully:

  python setup.py install
  
If that doesn't work, get paver and try:

  paver install
  
If that doesn't work, email me at ralsina@netmanagers.com.ar ;-)

Requirements
------------

* It needs PyQt 4.4.0 or later. Anything earlier will NOT work.

* It should get everything it needs from PyPI.python.org except for PyQt

* If you try it on windows, get simplejson 1.9.0 because 1.9.1 doesn't seem to build:

  easy_install simplejson==1.9.0 

* I have only tested this with Elixir 0.5.2, SQLAlchemy 0.4.6 and Migrate 0.4.5

* If you got this from SVN and not a source tarball, you are missing files.

  You can generate them using setup.py:

    python setup.py compile_resource compile_ui
    
  Or, if you have paver installed:
  
    paver compile_resource compile_ui

  Those commands require a working PyQt 4.4 (at least) developing environment.

If you have no idea what I'm talking about, use a package instead of SVN ;-)

Help wanted
-----------

I really want to make uRSSus work well on Windows and Mac. If you know python
in those platforms, I would love to hear from you.
