0.7 (06/19/2007)
----------------

- Feature: Added a Chinese PDF sample file to ``tests/expected`` under the
  name ``sample-shipment-chinese.pdf``.

- Feature: Added another tag that is commonly needed in projects. The
  ``<keepTogether>`` tag will keep the child flowables in the same frame.
  When necessary, the frame break will be automatic. Patch by Yuan Hong.

- Feature: Added the "alignment" attribute to the ``blockTable``
  directive. This attribute defines the horizontal alignment for a table that
  is not 100% in width of the containing flowable. Patch by Yuan Hong.

- Feature: When creating Chinese PDF documents, the normal TTF for Chinese
  printing is 'simsun'. However, when bold text is neeed, we switch to
  'simhei'. To properly register this, we need the
  ``reportlab.lib.fonts.addMapping`` function. This is missing in the reportlab
  RML specification, so a new directive has been defined::

    <addMapping faceName="simsun" bold="1" italic="0" psName="simhei" />

  Patch by Yuan Hong.

- Feature: The ``para`` and ``paraStyle`` directive now support the "wordWrap"
  attribute, which allows for selecting a different wrod wrapping
  algorithm. This is needed because some far-East Asian languages do not use
  white space to separate words. Patch by Yuan Hong.

- Bug: Handle Windows drive letters correctly. Report and fix by Yuan Hong.


0.6 (06/19/2007)
----------------

- Bug: Fixed setup.py to include all dependencies.

- Bug: Added test to show that a blocktable style can be applied multiple
  times. A user reported that this is not working, but I could not replicate
  the problem.

- Update: Updated the expected renderings to ReportLab 2.1. There were some
  good layout fixes that broke the image comparison.


0.5 (04/01/2007)
----------------
