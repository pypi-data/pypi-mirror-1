Description: The `buildutils` package contains extensions to Python's standard
        distribution utilities (`distutils`) that are often useful during the
        development of Python projects. `buildutils` was created to scratch an
        itch: removing ``make`` from the Python development process and partially
        to gain a better understanding of how `distutils` works.
        
        The following extension commands are included:
        
        announce
        send a release announcement to mailing lists
        like python-announce-list@python.org
        checksum
        generate MD5 and SHA-1 checksum files for distributables.
        etags
        generate an TAGS file over all packages and module (for use in Emacs).
        flakes
        find lint using the pyflakes utility.
        info
        dumps information about the project.
        publish
        push distributables and documentation up to a project site using
        ssh/scp/sftp.
        pudge
        build Python documentation from restructured text documents and
        Python doc strings.
        pytest
        run py.test unit tests.
        stats
        dump statistics on the number of lines, files, modules, packages,
        etc.
        use
        bring in a working version of a dependency (uses setuptools egg
        stuff).
