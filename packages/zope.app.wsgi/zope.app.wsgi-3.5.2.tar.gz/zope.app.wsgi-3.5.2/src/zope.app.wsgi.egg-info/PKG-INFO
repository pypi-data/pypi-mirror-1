Description: This package provides the ``WSGIPublisherApplication`` class which
        exposes the object publishing machinery in ``zope.publisher`` as a
        WSGI application.  It also lets us bring up the Zope application
        server (parsing ``zope.conf`` and ``site.zcml``) with a mere function
        call::
        
        >>> db = zope.app.wsgi.config('zope.conf')
        
        This is especially useful for debugging.
        
        To bring up Zope and obtain the WSGI application object at the same
        time, use the ``getWSGIApplication`` function.
        
        This package also provides an easy to use application factory for
        PasteDeploy_. You can simply specify an application configuration
        like this in your Paste configuration file::
        
        [app:main]
        use = egg:zope.app.wsgi
        config_file = %(here)s/zope.conf
        
        Look for more documentation inside the package itself.

        CHANGES
        =======
        
        3.5.2 (2009-04-03)
        ------------------
        
        - The ``WSGIPublisherApplication`` uses now the 'ILoggingInfo' concept given
        from zope.publisher.interfaces.logginginfo for log user infos usable for
        access logs. This allows you to implement your own access log user info
        message. See zope.publisher.interfaces.logginginfo.ILoggingInfo for more
        information.
        
        3.5.1 (2009-03-31)
        ------------------
        
        - The ``WSGIPublisherApplication`` call now provides a user name
        in the environment meant for use in logs.
        
        3.5.0 (2009-02-10)
        ------------------
        
        - Make devmode warning message more generic. We don't nesessary have the
        `etc/zope.conf` file nowadays when using buildout-based setups.
        
        - Add an application factory for Paste. So Zope application can now be
        easily deployed with Paste .ini configuration like this::
        
        [app:main]
        use = egg:zope.app.wsgi
        config_file = %(here)s/zope.conf
        handle_errors = false
        
        The config_file is a required argument, however the handle_errors
        defaults to True if not specified. Setting it to False allows you to
        make WSGIPublisherApplication not handle exceptions itself but
        propagate them to an upper middleware, like WebError or something.
        
        - The ``WSGIPublisherApplication`` constructor and ``getWSGIApplication``
        function now accept optional ``handle_errors`` argument, described
        above.
        
        - Change mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org instead of retired
        one.
        
        3.4.1 (2008-07-30)
        ------------------
        
        - Added Trove classifiers.
        
        - Notify WSGIPublisherApplicationCreated event when WSGI application is
        created.
        
        - Fixed deprecation warning in ftesting.zcml: ZopeSecurityPolicy moved to
        zope.securitypolicy.
        
        3.4.0 (2007-09-14)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed the tests to run on Python 2.5 as well as Python 2.4.
        
        - Split ``getApplication`` into ``config`` and ``getApplication`` so
        that ``config`` could be reused, for example for debugging.
        
        3.4.0a1 (2007-04-22)
        --------------------
        
        Initial release as a separate project, corresponds to zope.app.wsgi
        from Zope 3.4.0a1
