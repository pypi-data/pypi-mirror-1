3.5.2 (unreleased)
------------------

- ...

3.5.1 (2009-03-31)
------------------

- The ``WSGIPublisherApplication`` call now provides a user name
  in the environment meant for use in logs.

3.5.0 (2009-02-10)
------------------

- Make devmode warning message more generic. We don't nesessary have the
  `etc/zope.conf` file nowadays when using buildout-based setups.

- Add an application factory for Paste. So Zope application can now be
  easily deployed with Paste .ini configuration like this::
  
    [app:main]
    use = egg:zope.app.wsgi
    config_file = %(here)s/zope.conf
    handle_errors = false

  The config_file is a required argument, however the handle_errors
  defaults to True if not specified. Setting it to False allows you to
  make WSGIPublisherApplication not handle exceptions itself but
  propagate them to an upper middleware, like WebError or something. 

- The ``WSGIPublisherApplication`` constructor and ``getWSGIApplication``
  function now accept optional ``handle_errors`` argument, described
  above. 

- Change mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org instead of retired
  one.

3.4.1 (2008-07-30)
------------------

- Added Trove classifiers.

- Notify WSGIPublisherApplicationCreated event when WSGI application is
  created.

- Fixed deprecation warning in ftesting.zcml: ZopeSecurityPolicy moved to
  zope.securitypolicy.

3.4.0 (2007-09-14)
------------------

- Fixed the tests to run on Python 2.5 as well as Python 2.4.

- Split ``getApplication`` into ``config`` and ``getApplication`` so
  that ``config`` could be reused, for example for debugging.

3.4.0a1 (2007-04-22)
--------------------

Initial release as a separate project, corresponds to zope.app.wsgi
from Zope 3.4.0a1
