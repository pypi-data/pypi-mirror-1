Description: Tramline is a upload and download accelerator that plugs into Apache,
        using mod_python. Its aim is to make downloading and uploading large
        media to an application server easy and fast, without overloading the
        application server with large amounts of binary data.
        
        Tramline integrates into Apache using mod_python. The application
        server is assumed to sit behind Apache, for instance hooked up using
        mod_proxy or mod_rewrite.
        
        Tramline takes over uploading and downloading files, handling these
        within Apache. Only a small configuration change in Apache should be
        necessary to enable tramline.
        
        The application server remains in complete control over security, page
        and form rendering, and everything else. Minimal changes are necessary
        to any application to enable it to work with tramline; in fact it's
        just setting two response headers in a few places in the code.
