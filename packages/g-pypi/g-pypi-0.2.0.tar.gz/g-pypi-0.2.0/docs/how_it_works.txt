This is a summary of how g-pypi finds the information it needs to create
an ebuild.

If you give g-pypi a package name with no other arguments it will:

1) Query PyPI for the package name and return the metadata
   a) If PyPI doesn't have the SRC_URI it tries to use setuptools to find it.
 
2) Use enamer.py to determine the package name and version if
possible (PN, MY_P, PV, MY_PV etc.) 

3) Write initial ebuild

4) Download the package and unarchive it and try to determine ${S}

5) Write ebuild again adding ${S}
