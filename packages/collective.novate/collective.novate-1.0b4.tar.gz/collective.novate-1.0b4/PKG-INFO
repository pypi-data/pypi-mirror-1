Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package provides a link on the sharing page to change the ownership of
        a content item. The link goes to a form with an auto-complete widget for
        finding the new owner.
        
        Installation
        -------------
        
        This product depends on five.grok, plone.directives.form,
        plone.formwidget.autocomplete and plone.principalsource. The latter three in
        turn depend on plone.autoform, plone.z3cform and z3c.form. On Plone 3.x,
        this means you need to add a few lines to your buildout to correctly
        configure dependencies. (You should also check that these packages have been
        released. At the time of writing, they have not, and as such must be run from
        a development checkout. However, they should be released shortly.)
        
        Firstly, in the [zope2] section of your buildout.cfg, enable fake eggs, but skip some::
        
        [zope2]
        recipe = plone.recipe.zope2install
        ...
        fake-zope-eggs = true
        additional-fake-eggs =
        ZConfig
        pytz
        skip-fake-eggs =
        zope.component
        zope.testing
        zope.i18n
        zope.securitypolicy
        zope.app.zcmlfiles
        ...
        
        Then, add some version pins to your [versions] block. Create this if it does
        not exist already::
        
        [buildout]
        ...
        versions = versions
        ...
        
        [versions]
        ...
        zope.i18n = 3.4.0
        zope.testing = 3.4.0
        zope.component = 3.4.0
        zope.securitypolicy = 3.4.0
        zope.app.zcmlfiles = 3.4.3
