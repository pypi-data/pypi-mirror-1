Description: Overview
        ========
        
        TracSubPages is a Trac plugin that supplies a macro allowing full wiki pages to be displayed inside of other wiki pages. This is useful if there is a piece of content (such as a contact table or log) that needs to be displayed in multiple places, as it eliminates the need for each instance of this content to be maintained.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        The syntax for the subpage macro is simple: ::
        
        [[subpage(wiki_page, [show_link])]]
        
        Where `wiki_page` is the wiki page (No url is needed here, nor 'wiki/', just the page). The macro supports pages that aren't top-level, too ('BigCategory/SpecificSubject'). The second argument, `showlink` is an optional argument (`true` or `false`) that determines whether or not a link to edit the rendered page will be shown at the bottom of the subpage section (The link reads 'Edit Section' and provides a link directly to the edit page of the referenced wiki page).
        
        Limitations
        ===========
        
        * A wiki page needs to exist before you link to it with a subpage macro. This may seem obvious, but the error caused by a broken link isn't very descriptive (yet).
        * Please use only wiki formatting for subpages. The use of macros can (and probably will) cause errors.
