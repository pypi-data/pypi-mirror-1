        0.2 (2009-09-08)
        ================
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        * ``CHANGES.txt`` and ``README.txt`` have been added
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Some basic tests using py.test have been added
        
        
        Bugfixes
        --------
        
        * upper- and lowercase namespaces are not recognized, see issue 3:
        `issue 3 <http://code.google.com/p/pydataportability/issues/detail?id=3>`_; thanks to scherpenisse for the patch
        * service priorities and URI priorities have been mixed previously resulting in the service priority always being
        the last URI priority to be found, this is fixed now.
        * ElementTree import is made more stable to check for alternative locations (see
        `issue 4 <http://code.google.com/p/pydataportability/issues/detail?id=4>`_)
        
        Backwards Incompatibilities
        ---------------------------
        
        * `localid` can occur multiple times with different priorities. We just checked for a single element without
        a priority. A new ``LocalID`` class which holds the id and the priority has been added and will be returned as
        ``localids`` attribute on the ``Service`` class.
        * priorities will now be always converted to integers or to ``None`` in case the value is ``null``.
        * the ``prio`` attribute of the ``URI`` class has been renamed to ``priority``
        * the default value for ``priority`` parameters in constructors has been changed from ``0`` to ``None``.
