How to make a release:

- build tar.gz, egg for 2.4 and 2.5 and send them to pypi.
  On my system (Unbuntu gutsy):
    python2.4 setup.py egg_info -RDb "" register bdist_egg upload
    python2.5 setup.py egg_info -RDb "" sdist bdist_egg upload

- announce release on python-announce-list@python.org
- announce release on mindstorms community list (forums.nxtasy.org)

- bump the version in setup.py and commit
