Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This project aims to virtualize Plone default keywords (categories), which are
        flat, to the tree. Contains Archetypes widget, based on InAndOut widget, which
        replaces Plone's default widget for categories and contains configlet which
        allows to assign flat keywords to virtual tree defined in the configlet.
        
        Site manager defines virtual tree nodes and assigns keywords to the nodes. One
        keyword may be assigned to any number of nodes (0-all).
        
        Archetypes widget contains javascript based filter which allows to filter out
        unwanted nodes and displays keywords in the selected node(s) only. Keywords are
        stored in the same way as in Plone default so storage is 100% compatible and
        don't require any migrations. You can always remove this package and your
        content-keywords assignment stays untouched.
        
        Please note, this package '''does not''' replace AT KeywordWidget of Subject
        (Categories) field. It means you may define categories tree but you can't test
        keyword selection in the conten type Categorization tab. You may uncomment part
        of code in widget.py or use the following example in your custom package::
        
        from collective.virtualtreecategories.widget import VirtualTreeCategoriesWidget
        from Products.ATContentTypes.content.document import ATDocumentSchema
        old = ATDocumentSchema['subject'].widget
        ATDocumentSchema['subject'].widget = VirtualTreeCategoriesWidget(label=old.label, description=old.description)
        del old
