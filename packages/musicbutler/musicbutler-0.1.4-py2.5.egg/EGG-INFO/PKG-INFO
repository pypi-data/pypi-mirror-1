Description: 
        *** NOTE: This is an alpha product.  It's not quite to the
        point of playing music yet, which should happen in 0.2.0.***
        
        When MusicButler has been told what albums you own, a spoken
        conversation with it might go like this:
        
        * "Jimmy, what albums do I have?"
        * "Here are 3 out of your 58 albums: In Rainbows by Radiohead,
        Deja Vu by Crosby Stills Nash and Young, and Atlanta
        by Alison Krauss."
        * "Jimmy, what Radiohead albums do I have?"
        * "You have 2 albums by Radiohead: In Rainbows, and OK Computer."
        * "Jimmy, play me some Alison Krauss."
        * "Playing New Favorite by Alison Krauss."
        
        
        Uses the 'speech' module -- see that on pypi for prerequisites.
        
        
        Please let me know if you like or use this module - it would make
        my day!
