Description: 
        *** NOTE: This is an alpha product.  It doesn't actually play
        music yet -- it just understands commands and runs stub functions
        for playing music. ***
        
        When MusicButler has been told what albums you own, a spoken
        conversation with it might go like this:
        
        * "Jimmy, what albums do I have?"
        * "Here are 3 out of your 58 albums: In Rainbows by Radiohead,
        Deja Vu by Crosby Stills Nash and Young, and Atlanta
        by Alison Krauss."
        * "Jimmy, what Radiohead albums do I have?"
        * "You have 2 albums by Radiohead: In Rainbows, and OK Computer."
        * "Jimmy, play me some Alison Krauss."
        * "Playing New Favorite by Alison Krauss."
        
        
        For the required Python 'speech' module to work, you must:
        
        * Install the Microsoft Speech kit: download
        and run "SpeechSDK51.exe" from http://tinyurl.com/5m6v2
        * Then open PythonWin (installable via http://tinyurl.com/5ezco9)
        and choose Tools | COM MakePY utility | Microsoft
        Speech Object Library 5.0.
        
        
        
        Please let me know if you like or use this module - it would make
        my day!
