        =====
        
        httop is a console tool to monitor the responsiveness of websites (or any URL)
        like monitoring  your system processes with ``top``.
        
        URLs are re-checked 3 seconds after their last result was received.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Create a configuration file in your home directory called ``.httop`` listing
        the URLs that should be monitored::
        
        http://localhost:8080
        http://www.foodibar.com
        
        Then, start the script without any parameters::
        
        $ httop
        
        While running, you can update the configuration file. New URLs will be
        picked up automatically and removed URLs will be dropped.
