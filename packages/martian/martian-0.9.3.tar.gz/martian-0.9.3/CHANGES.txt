0.9.3 (2008-01-26)
==================

Feature changes
---------------

* Added an OptionalValueDirective which allows the construction of
  directives that take either zero or one argument. If no arguments
  are given, the ``default_value`` method on the directive is
  called. Subclasses need to override this to return the default value
  to use.

Restructuring
-------------

* Move some util functions that were really grok-specific out of Martian
  back into Grok.

0.9.2 (2007-11-20)
==================

Bug fixes
---------

* scan.module_info_from_dotted_name() now has special behavior when it
  runs into __builtin__. Previously, it would crash with an error. Now
  it will return an instance of BuiltinModuleInfo. This is a very
  simple implementation which provides just enough information to make
  client code work. Typically this client code is test-related so that
  the module context will be __builtin__.

0.9.1 (2007-10-30)
==================

Feature changes
---------------

* Grokkers now receive a ``module_info`` keyword argument.  This
  change is completely backwards-compatible since grokkers which don't
  take ``module_info`` explicitly will absorb the extra argument in
  ``**kw``.

0.9 (2007-10-02)
=================

Feature changes
---------------

* Reverted the behaviour where modules called tests or ftests were skipped
  by default and added an API to provides a filtering function for skipping
  modules to be grokked.

0.8.1 (2007-08-13)
==================

Feature changes
---------------

* Don't grok tests or ftests modules.

Bugs fixed
----------

* Fix a bug where if a class had multiple base classes, this could end up
  in the resultant list multiple times.

0.8 (2007-07-02)
================

Feature changes
---------------

* Initial public release.
