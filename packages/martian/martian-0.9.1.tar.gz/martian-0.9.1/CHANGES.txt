0.9.1 (2007-10-30)
==================

Feature changes
---------------

* Grokkers now receive a ``module_info`` keyword argument.  This
  change is completely backwards-compatible since grokkers which don't
  take ``module_info`` explicitly will absorb the extra argument in
  ``**kw``.

0.9 (2007-10-02)
=================

Feature changes
---------------

* Reverted the behaviour where modules called tests or ftests were skipped
  by default and added an API to provides a filtering function for skipping
  modules to be grokked.

0.8.1 (2007-08-13)
==================

Feature changes
---------------

* Don't grok tests or ftests modules.

Bugs fixed
----------

* Fix a bug where if a class had multiple base classes, this could end up
  in the resultant list multiple times.

0.8 (2007-07-02)
================

Feature changes
---------------

* Initial public release.
