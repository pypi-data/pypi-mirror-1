Description: 
        
        The ``troll.storage`` package provides an abstract approach for the
        storage problematics. It defines a simple, yet exhaustive, api to deal
        with all kind of storage.
        
        It provides :
        
        - A clear API as interfaces
        
        - A base class adapter that provides a basic implementation.
        
        - A demonstrative, yet functional, annotation descriptor, to handle
        annotation storages.

        How does it work?
        =================
        
        The system uses the basic zope3 components system to be flexible and
        pluggable. There are 3 main parts :
        
        - the Handler : the straightforward API to store, retrieve and
        delete. It's implemented as an adapter.
        
        - the Storage : a storage object that implements IStorage. It can be a
        zope container or a layer to write in a relational database.
        
        - the Stored Item : a very lightly contrained object that is to be
        stored in Storage.

        Nothing is like code reading to understand how to use it and why to
        use it. I recommand you read the tests. They demonstrate all the basic
        usecases.
