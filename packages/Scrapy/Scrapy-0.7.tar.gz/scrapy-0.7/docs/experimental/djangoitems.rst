DjangoItem
==========

DjangoItems are a class of Item that gets its fields definition from a Django
model, you simply create a DjangoItem and specify what Django model it relates
to.

Besides of getting the model fields defined on your Item, DjangoItem provides a
mathod to create and populate a Django model instance with the Item data.

Using DjangoItem
================

DjangoItem works much like ModelForms in Django, you create a subclass and
define its ``django_model`` atribute to ve a valid Django model.  With this you
will get an Item with a field for each Django model field. 

In addition, you can define fields that aren't present in the model and even
override fields that are present in the model defining them in the item. 

Let's see some examples:

Django model for the examples::

   class Person(models.Model):
       name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
       age = models.IntegerField()

Defining a basic DjangoItem:
    
   class PersonItem(DjangoItem):
       django_model = Person
       
DjangoItem work just like :class:`scrapy.item.Item`::

   p = PersonItem()
   p['name'] = 'John'
   p['age'] = '22'

To obtain the Django model from the item, we call the extra method save() of
the DjangoItem::

   >>> person = p.save()
   >>> person.name
   'John'
   >>> person.age
   '22'
   >>> person.id
   1

As you see the model is already saved when we call save, we can prevent this by
calling it with ``commit=False``:: We can use commit=False in save method to
obtain an unsaved model:

   person = p.save(commit=False)
   person.name
   'John'
   person.age
   '22'
   person.id
   None

As said before, we can add other fields to the Item::

   class PersonItem(DjangoItem):
       django_model = Person
       sex = Field()

   p = PersonItem()
   p['name'] = 'John'
   p['age'] = '22'
   p['sex'] = 'M'

.. note:: fields added to the Item won't be taken into account when doing a save()

And we can override the fields of the model with your own:

class PersonItem(DjangoItem):
    django_model = Person
    name = Field(default='No Name')

This is usefull to provide properties to the field, like a default or any other
property that your project uses.
