0.1b1 (2009-08-13)
==================

- Add support for windows by adding a SimpleParse egg.
- Use sw.objectinspection instead of `ObjectParser` to inspect objects for
  attributes and children. This brings much more flexibility in inspecting
  custom objects.


0.1b (2009-07-23)
=================

- Small API refactorings (#5780)
- Add support for querying for classes of a given module (#5778).
- Add support for querying for base classes of objects (#4880).


0.1a2 (2009-06-17)
==================

- Better handling of unpersistent objects.


0.1a1 (2009-06-05)
==================

- Stop ignoring callable objects (e.g. a Plone site) for indexing, just once
  ignore methods.

- Do not break during indexing if added object is not added to the ZODB
  (doesn't have the `_p_oid` attribute). Those objects are ignored for now
  and not added to the index structures. 

- Add ``rindex`` method for adding objects to the collection recursively.

- Add SimpleParse as a 3rdparty egg because it can't be retrieved from pypi
  for some months now.
