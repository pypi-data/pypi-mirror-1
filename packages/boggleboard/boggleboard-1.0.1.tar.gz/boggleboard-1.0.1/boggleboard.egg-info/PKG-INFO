Description: 
        A package to generate and manipulate Boggle-style boards. Boards of different
        sizes can be randomly generated, and given a list of acceptable words, the
        package can find all words in a particular Boggle board. Currently, the package
        offers standard nxn Boggle boards, arbitrary rectangular Boggle boards, and
        toroidal Boggle boards (i.e. boards where one can scroll from the top row to the
        bottom row and vice-versa, and from the left column to the right column and
        vice-versa).
        
        Additionally, the package contains an anagram-type solver, such as finding the
        words in a Scrabble hand.
        
        Boards of arbitrary shapes and sizes can be made by subclassing the
        AbstractBoggleBoard class and specifying an adjacency graph using the positions
        of the board as nodes.
        
        1.0.1: Minor fixes and improvements in documentation.
