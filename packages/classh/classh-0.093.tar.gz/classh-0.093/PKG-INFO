Description: 
        
        classh is yet another wrapper around ssh for running jobs on multiple
        targets.  It can support tens of thousands of targets (tested on over
        25,000 at once) and runs a configurable number of jobs concurrently.
        It separately gathers results, output and error messages, displaying
        summary/status information it comes in (asynchronously) and more
        detailed data after all jobs have completed.
        
        classh provides an SSHJobMan class which can be imported into your own
        Python code and easily used to handle specialized display or other
        disposition of results.  (For example the names of all hosts on which
        the job succeeded can be fed into another process while various failure
        modes can be tested and fed into other processes).
