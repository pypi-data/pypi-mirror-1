0.5.0: 2009-08-XX
=================

- Complete refactoring to use libsidx - a C API for libspatialindex.  The 
  code is now ctypes over libsidx, and a number of new features are now available 
  as a result of this refactoring.
  
  * ability to store pickles within the index (clustered index)
  * ability to use custom extension names for disk-based indexes
  * ability to modify many index parameters at instantiation time
  * storage of point data reduced by a factor of 4
  * bulk loading of indexes at instantiation time
  * ability to quickly return the bounds of the entire index
  * ability to return the bounds of index entries
  * much better windows support 
  * libspatialindex 1.4.0 required.
