iconv_codec: module to register codecs to encode/decode any char supported by 
system's iconv command.

The codecs are registered in python and are available on all python functions
that support an encoding parameter.

Installation:
   python setup.py install
   
   Alternatively just copy the module to your application or to your python
   library path (it is a single file)

Usage:
   After importing the module, just use the encoding with the 'iconv:' prefix.
   Examples:
   
   >>> import iconv_codecs
   >>> '\xa3\x85\xa2\xa3'.decode('iconv:CP284')
   u'test'
   >>> u'testing'.encode('iconv:CSEBCDICFISEA')
   '\xa3\x85\xa2\xa3\x89\x95\x87'
