Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        A correctly working File widget and field for zope.
        
        The standard FileWidget returns a string instead of an IFile instance,
        which means it will always fail schema validation in formlib.
        
        In addition this widget will also extract the filename and Content-Type
        from the request.
