object to a relational database. It automatically captures and records
events for object added, modified, deleted.  in addition if the
respective packages are present it also records worklow events (
ore.workflow ) and versioning ( alchemist.versioning ).

All events record time, action, active user, in addition modification
events capture field change descriptions, to allow for listing
attributes changed.
