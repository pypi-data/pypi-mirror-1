Description: Alchemist Auditing
        ------------------
        
        
        Alchemist auditing provides a facility for auditing changes to an
        object to a relational database. It automatically captures and records
        events for object added, modified, deleted.  in addition if the
        respective packages are present it also records worklow events (
        ore.workflow ) and versioning ( alchemist.versioning ).
        
        All events record time, action, active user, in addition modification
        events capture field change descriptions, to allow for listing
        attributes changed.
