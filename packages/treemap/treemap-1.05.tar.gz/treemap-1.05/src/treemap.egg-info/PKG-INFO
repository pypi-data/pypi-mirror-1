Description: This module gives you an easy way to create a treemap
        from pretty much any data.  You can read about the history of treeviews
        at http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/treemap-history/index.shtml.  This
        implementation uses pylab to display the resulting map, and the map can
        be zoomed by clicking on a node.
