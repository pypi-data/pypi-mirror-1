Installation
============

To install quintagroup.pingtool into the global Python environment (or a workingenv), using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:

* Copy ``quintagroup`` folder to the ``/path/to/instance/lib/python`` directory of your Zope instance.

* Create a file called ``quintagroup.pingtool-configure.zcml`` in the ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory of your Zope instance.
  The file should only contain this::

  <include package="quintagroup.pingtool" />

* Restart the Zope server, for example with the following command in the terminal::

   $ ./bin/zopectl restart

Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and 
the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

* Add ``quintagroup.pingtool`` to the list of eggs to install.::
 
    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        quintagroup.pingtool
        
* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::
  
    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        quintagroup.pingtool
        
* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
  
    $ ./bin/buildout
        
* Restart the Zope server, e.g with the following command in the terminal::

   $ ./bin/instance restart

Install quintagroup.pingtool with quickinstaller in Plone.
