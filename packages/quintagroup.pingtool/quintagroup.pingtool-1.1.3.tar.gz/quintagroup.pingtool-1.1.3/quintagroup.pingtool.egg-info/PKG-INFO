        Installation
        ============
        
        To install quintagroup.pingtool into the global Python environment (or a workingenv), using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:
        
        * Copy ``quintagroup`` folder to the ``/path/to/instance/lib/python`` directory of your Zope instance.
        
        * Create a file called ``quintagroup.pingtool-configure.zcml`` in the ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory of your Zope instance.
        The file should only contain this::
        
        <include package="quintagroup.pingtool" />
        
        * Restart the Zope server, for example with the following command in the terminal::
        
        $ ./bin/zopectl restart
        
        Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and
        the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to manage your project, you can do this:
        
        * Add ``quintagroup.pingtool`` to the list of eggs to install.::
        
        [buildout]
        ...
        eggs =
        ...
        quintagroup.pingtool
        
        * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::
        
        [instance]
        recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
        ...
        zcml =
        quintagroup.pingtool
        
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
        
        $ ./bin/buildout
        
        * Restart the Zope server, e.g with the following command in the terminal::
        
        $ ./bin/instance restart
        
        Install quintagroup.pingtool with quickinstaller in Plone.
