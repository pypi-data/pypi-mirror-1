FABRIC README.

Fabric is a simple pythonic remote deployment tool. 

It is designed to upload files to, and run shell commands on, a number of
servers in parallel or serially. These commands are grouped in tasks (regular
python functions) and specified in a 'fabfile'. 

It is a bit like a dumbed down Capistrano, except it's in Python, dosn't expect
you to be deploying Rails applications, and the 'put' command works. 

Unlike Capistrano, Fabric want's to stay small, light, easy to change and not
bound to any specific framework.

Once installed, you can run 'fab help' to learn more about how to use Fabric.
