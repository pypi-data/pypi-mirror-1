Description: 
        It is designed to upload files to, and run shell commands on, a number of
        servers in parallel or serially. These commands are grouped in tasks (regular
        python functions) and specified in a 'fabfile'.
        
        It is a bit like a dumbed down Capistrano, except it's in Python, dosn't expect
        you to be deploying Rails applications, and the 'put' command works.
        
        Unlike Capistrano, Fabric want's to stay small, light, easy to change and not
        bound to any specific framework.
