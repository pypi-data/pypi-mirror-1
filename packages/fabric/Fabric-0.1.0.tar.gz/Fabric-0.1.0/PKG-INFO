Description: 
        It is designed to upload files to, and run shell commands on, a number of
        servers in parallel or serially. These commands are grouped in tasks (regular
        python functions) and specified in a 'fabfile.'
        
        This is called remote automation, and the primary use case is deploying
        applications to multiple similar hosts.
        
        Although it is easier to automate when the target hosts are similar, it is not
        a requirement and Fabric has features for working with heterogeneous hosts as
        well.
        
        Once installed, you can run `fab help` to learn more about how to use Fabric.
