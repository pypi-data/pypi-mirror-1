Description: An app for managing static file dependencies using Django's ORM as a data store. This is useful when, for example, building a large resource in many stages from a variety of static dependencies, both data files and python modules. Simple methods are provided for querying whether the generated resource is up-to-date based on the checksum of its dependencies.
