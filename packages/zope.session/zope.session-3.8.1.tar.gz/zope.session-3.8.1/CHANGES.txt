CHANGES
=======

3.8.1 (unreleased)
------------------

- Add an ability to set cookie effective domain for CookieClientIdManager.
  This is useful for simple cases when you have your application set up on
  one domain and you want your identification cookie be active for subdomains.

- Python 2.6 compatibility change. Encode strings before calling hmac.new()
  as the function no longer accepts the unicode() type.

3.8.0 (2008-12-31)
------------------

- Add missing test dependency on ``zope.site`` and
  ``zope.app.publication``.

3.7.1 (2008-12-30)
------------------

- Specify i18n_domain for titles in apidoc.zcml

- ZODB 3.9 no longer contains
  ZODB.utils.ConflictResolvingMappingStorage, fixed tests, so they
  work both with ZODB 3.8 and 3.9.


3.7.0 (2008-10-03)
------------------

New features:

- Added a 'postOnly' option on CookieClientIdManagers to only allow setting
  the client id cookie on POST requests.  This is to further reduce risk from
  broken caches handing the same client id out to multiple users. (Of
  course, it doesn't help if caches are broken enough to cache POSTs.)

3.6.0 (2008-08-12)
------------------

New features:

- Added a 'secure' option on CookieClientIdManagers to cause the secure
  set-cookie option to be used, which tells the browser not to send the
  cookie over http.

  This provides enhanced security for ssl-only applications.

- Only set the client-id cookie if it isn't already set and try to
  prevent the header from being cached.  This is to minimize risk from
  broken caches handing the same client id out to multiple users. 

3.5.2 (2008-06-12)
------------------

- Remove ConflictErrors caused on SessionData caused by setting
  ``lastAccessTime``.

3.5.1 (2008-04-30)
------------------

- Split up the ZCML to make it possible to re-use more reasonably.


3.5.0 (2008-03-11)
------------------

- Change the default session "resolution" to a sane value and document/test it.


3.4.1 (2007-09-25)
------------------

- Fixed some meta data and switch to tgz release.


3.4.0 (2007-09-25)
------------------

- Moved parts from ``zope.app.session`` to this packages
