        =======================
        
        This is a session backend for Django that stores sessions in a Tokyo Cabinet
        database, which communicates via Tokyo Tyrant using the PyTyrant library.  Tokyo
        Cabinet is a key-value store similar to BDB.
        
        The advantage to using this over other solutions is that your data is persistent
        unlike memcached, and Tokyo Cabinet is designed to store key-value data like
        this, so performance is much closer to that of memcached than with a database.
        
        Installing django-tokyo-sessions
        -----------------------------------
        
        1. Either download the tarball and run ``python setup.py install``, or simply
        use easy install or pip like so ``easy_install django-tokyo-sessions``.
        
        
        2. Set ``tokyo_sessions.tokyo`` as your session engine, like so::
        
        SESSION_ENGINE = 'tokyo_sessions.tokyo'
        
        
        3. Add settings describing where to connect to the Tokyo Tyrant database::
        
        TT_HOST = '127.0.0.1'
        TT_PORT = 1978
        
        
        That's it.  Hopefully this backend gives you all the better performance while
        still not sacrificing persistence.
