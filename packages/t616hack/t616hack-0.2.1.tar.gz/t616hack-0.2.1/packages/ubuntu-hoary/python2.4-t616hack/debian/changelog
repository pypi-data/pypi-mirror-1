t616hack (0.2-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Introduced improved support for Unicode, meaning that
    text may be supplied as Unicode objects to API methods;
    conversions to and from the telephone's active character
    set will happen without requiring any intervention from
    API clients.
  * Added support for writing new messages.
  * Updated the tools to make use of CMDsyntax-supported
    arguments, and to work with Unicode (where appropriate).
