Original Licence Information
----------------------------

The docs/LICENCE-original.txt file contains the licence text for the version
of t616hack from which this distribution is derived. With only one exception
(see below), it is included only for reference, as since it appears to be a
new-style BSD licence, which is stated as being compatible with the GNU
licences [1], licensing this derived work under the GNU LGPL does not
apparently conflict with the original licensing conditions.

Note that this derived work is only licensed under the LGPL as stated above in
the licence agreement section. The only exception to this (as mentioned above)
is the tools/Nokia_converter.py program which is licensed under the original
terms, as described in the docs/LICENCE-original.txt file, because no
significant changes have been made to the program. All other files which were
present in the version of t616hack from which this distribution is derived
have been modified and are, as stated above, only licensed as provided here
under the LGPL.
