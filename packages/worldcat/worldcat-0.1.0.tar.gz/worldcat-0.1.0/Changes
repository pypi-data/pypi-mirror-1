v0.1.0 Thu Nov  6 01:05:50 EST 2008
- Added iterators to SRURequest and OpenSearchRequest in worldcat.request.search.
  These need testing, so please submit any feedback.
  
- Correcting, adding, and cleaning up docstrings

v0.0.6 Tue Sep 16 17:56:37 EDT 2008
- Fix in worldcat.util.extract.pymarc_extract where the XML handlers grew
  uncontrollably

v0.0.5 Mon Sep 15 17:34:02 EDT 2008
- Added worldcat.util.extract, which assists in extracting records from SRU
  requests. This module adds a dependency on Pymarc >= 1.2 because of
  worldcat.util.extract.pymarc_extract(). In addition, we may want to switch
  its use of StringIO to use an InputSource object instead.

- Added a Changes file :)

v0.0.4 Tue Aug 19 22:28 EDT 2008
