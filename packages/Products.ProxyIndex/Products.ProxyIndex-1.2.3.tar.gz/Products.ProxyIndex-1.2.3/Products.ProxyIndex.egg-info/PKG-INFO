Description: Proxy Index
        ===========
        
        Purpose
        -------
        
        Proxy Index, is a plugin catalog index. it uses a tales expression to
        retrieve a value to index from an object.  the value retrieved can
        then be indexed by any available plugin index.
        
        Primary Use Case
        ----------------
        
        For indexing attributes of subobjects when indexing a container, like
        a composite elements of a compound document, or object annotations.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        From the ZCatalog indexes tab, add a index of type proxy index.
        
        On the add form the following fields are defined:
        
        Id
        pick any valid id you like
        
        Delegated type
        the type of index you'd like to use for the value
        
        Tales expression
        a tales expression evaluated for the value to index.
        
        The default context includes ``object`` (the object being indexed)
        and the following standard tales objects:
        
        - nothing
        - request
        - modules
        
        Key Value Pairs
        are input forms for passing values to the index constructor, if
        any are needed. (as with zctextindex for example).  for most index
        types this can be left blank
        
        As an example here's how to fill out a form for ZCTextIndex::
        
        key value pair: lexicon_id  my_lexicon
        key value pair: index_type  Cosine Measure
        key value pair: doc_attr    proxy_value
        
        
        The last key value pair could use a little explanation.
        internally the proxy index stores the index as an index
        named ``proxy_value``, the behavior for most indexes is
        to index an attribute name thats equivalent to the index's
        id. proxy index, constructs a wrapper object for the indexing
        setting the value of the tales expression equal to that
        of the index name. in this case, ZCTextIndex must be
        treated slightly differently as it can index an arbitrary
        attribute independent of its name, for most other index types
        this is not needed.
