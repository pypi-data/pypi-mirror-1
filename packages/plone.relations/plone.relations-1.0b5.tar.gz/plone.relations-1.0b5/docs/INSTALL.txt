plone.relations Installation
=======================

 * When you're reading this you have probably already run 
   ``easy_install plone.relations``. Find out how to install setuptools
   (and EasyInstall) here:
   http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall

 * Create a file called ``plone.relations-configure.zcml`` in the
   ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
   should only contain this::

       <include package="plone.relations" />
