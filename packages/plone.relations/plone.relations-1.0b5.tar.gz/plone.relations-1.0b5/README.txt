plone.relations Package Readme
==============================

Overview
--------

Tools for defining and querying complex relationships between objects.  This
product builds on and requires zc.relationship available in the zope.org svn, 
and also five.intid available in the Plone collective.  The tests require
some helpers from collective.testing to run.

See plone/relations/README.txt for complete documentation.

Based on the index and relationship container from zc.relationship by
Gary Poster from Zope Corporation, and the port of the Zope intid utility
to Zope 2 by Whit Morriss in five.intid.  This package includes a slightly
modified version of ``container.txt`` from zc.relationship which is copyright
Zope Corporation and distributed under the ZPL.  The package was mostly
inspired by ideas in the doctests of that product.
