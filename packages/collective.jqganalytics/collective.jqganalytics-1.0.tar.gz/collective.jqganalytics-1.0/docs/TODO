Roadmap
=======

1.0
---

Integrate the jQuery plugin for Google Analytics by providing the file and 
adding it to the javascript registry below the jquery file. Provide a viewlet 
calls the plugin to track the page view. Tracker customization is through a 
Plone configuration panel configlet.

1.1
---

Add variable tracking code (may be necessary to modify the plugin) and extend 
the configlet to configure the variables.
