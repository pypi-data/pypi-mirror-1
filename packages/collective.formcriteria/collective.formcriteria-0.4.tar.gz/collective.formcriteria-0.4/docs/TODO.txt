* Additional Criteria

  Currently only some criteria have form criteria equivalents.  The
  intention is to add form criteria for the rest of the ATCT criteria as
  well.  I'm only likely to get to the ones that I need without any
  further input, so if you want one in particular let me know.

* Form sort criteria

* Use subcollections to support AdvancedQuery operations

  Collections will act as grouping/parenthesis *and* operators.  IOW,
  a collection will have a boolean field to set whether it uses AND or
  OR to find the intersection or union of its result sets.
  Sub-collections will not acquire criteria but instead parent
  collections will treat sub-collections as criteria groupings.  Not
  yet sure how to handle sorting.
