* Additional Criteria

Currently the only form criterion is the simple string criterion.  The
intention is to add form criteria for the rest of the ATCT criteria as
well.  I'm only likely to get to the ones that I need without any
further input, so if you want one in particular let me know.

There are some caveats about implementing form criteria.  The name of
the criterion fields do not actually correspond to name of the index
queried.  For most criterion, the field rendered to collect the index
value is the "value" field of the criterion, regardless of what index
it's used for.  For some of the more complex criteria, it may not be
true that all that is needed is to render the "value" field with the
name of the index to be queried.  Form criteria will still be
possible, but more complex.  In summary, implementation will be simple
for criteria that need only render the "value" field which can be
given the criterion.Field() as its name attribute and still work with
the catalog query.
