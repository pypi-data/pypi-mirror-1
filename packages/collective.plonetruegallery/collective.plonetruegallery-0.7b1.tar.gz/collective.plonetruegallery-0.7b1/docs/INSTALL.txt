collective.plonetruegallery Installation
========================================

To install collective.plonetruegallery into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:

* When you're reading this you have probably already run 
  ``easy_install collective.plonetruegallery``. Find out how to install setuptools
  (and EasyInstall) here:
  http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall

* Create a file called ``collective.plonetruegallery-configure.zcml`` in the
  ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
  should only contain this::

    <include package="collective.plonetruegallery" />

For picasa support:

* easy_install gdata

For flickr support:

* easy_install flickrapi

Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

* Add ``collective.plonetruegallery`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::

   [buildout]
   ...
   eggs =
       ...
       collective.plonetruegallery

* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::

  [instance]
  recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
  ...
  zcml =
      collective.plonetruegallery
      
* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::

  $ ./bin/buildout

You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.

For picasa support:

* Add ``gdata`` to your buildout

  [buildout]
  ...
  eggs =
    ...
    gdata
    
For flickr support:

* add ``flickrapi`` to your buildout:

  [buildout]
  ...
  eggs =
    ...
    flickrapi
