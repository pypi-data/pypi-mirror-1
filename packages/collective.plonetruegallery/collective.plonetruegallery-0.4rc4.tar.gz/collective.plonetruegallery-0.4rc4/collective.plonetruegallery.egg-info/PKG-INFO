Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This plone product integrates Smooth Gallery into plone.
        
        It was inspired by plonegalleryview, but is different in many approaches.
        
        It is suggested that you install PloneFlashUpload with this product to make it easier to add images.
        
        Features:
        -Gallery Content Type
        -Customize smooth gallery size, transition, and other settings
        -Can use nested galleries
        
        Dependencies:
        -gdata - gdata.py is broken so you will need to install this yourself if you want picasa support
        -flickrapi
        
        This product was created at the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh for use there.
