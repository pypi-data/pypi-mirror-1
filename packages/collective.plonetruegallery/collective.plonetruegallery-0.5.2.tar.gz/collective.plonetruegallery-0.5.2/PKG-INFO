Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This product provides a clean implementation of a gallery with gallery types and the support of sub galleries.
        This projects aims at a plone gallery product that does not depend on mooTools or any other gallery or slideshow javascript library.
        It also has support for picasa and flickr albums all while dynamically loading the images so it large albums load a little better than other versions.
        
        Features:
        -Gallery Content Type
        -Customize smooth gallery size, transition, timed and other settings
        -Can use nested galleries
        
        Browsers Tested On:

        -FF2
        -FF3
        -Safari
        -Opera 9
