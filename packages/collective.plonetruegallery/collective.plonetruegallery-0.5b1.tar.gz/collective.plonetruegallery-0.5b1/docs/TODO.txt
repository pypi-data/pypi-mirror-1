*upgrade steps - need to do something about old SubGallery objs..
*cross browser support - should be okay except for stupid kukit not being included in IE
*dynamic resizing of carousel since it is acting funny on FF3?
*add flickr authentication ability
*display for subgalleries needs styling
*STYLE EVERYTHING - hopefully some professional help - MAKE PRETTY
*kukit.js not being included in IE??? - WEIRD
*refactor to try and only use one gallery type instance per gallery(weird problems earlier)
