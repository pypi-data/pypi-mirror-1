Introduction

collective.plonetruegallery is a Plone product that gives you a Gallery content type.  It allows you to add regular Plone Galleries, Picasa Web Albums or even Flickr sets.

Flickr and Picasa Web Album Support
-----------------------------------

* to add support for these type of galleries you must install additional packages
* install flickrapi version 1.2 for flickr support
* install gdata version 1.2.3 or higher for Picasa Web Album Support
* these can just be added to your buildout or installed with easy_install

Fetching of Images Explained
----------------------------
* When rendering a gallery, it checks if the images have been fetched within the last 1440 minutes(one day). If they have not, then it fetches them again.  It also re-fetches the gallery on edits and when images are added/removed from a gallery. Since images are never really added/removed from a flickr or picasa type, it'll only be re-fetched every day unless you force it.
* You can also force a specific gallery to be re-fetched by appending ``refresh`` to the gallery url
* You can manually refresh all galleries on the site by typing in a url like ``mysite.com/refresh_all_galleries``  This means you can also setup a cron-like job to refresh all the galleries whenever you want to just so it isn't done while a user is trying to render a page.

This product's inspired usage was for the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh.
