Description: Introduction
        ------------
        collective.plonetruegallery is a Plone product that gives you a Gallery content type.  It allows you to add regular Plone Galleries, Picasa Web Albums or even Flickr sets.  It allows the user to display the gallery in 3 different sizes, choose between two different javascript gallery display types and customize transitions, effects, and timing.

        Flickr and Picasa Web Album Support
        -----------------------------------
        * these packages are no longer a dependency of this package
        * to add support for these type of galleries you must install additional packages
        * install flickrapi version 1.2 for flickr support
        * install gdata version 1.2.3 or higher for Picasa Web Album Support
        * these can just be added to your buildout or installed with easy_install
        
        Fetching of Images Explained
        ----------------------------
        * When rendering a gallery, it checks if the images have been fetched within the last 1440 minutes(one day). If they have not, then it fetches them again.  It also re-fetches the gallery on edits and when images are added/removed from a gallery. Since images are never really added/removed from a flickr or picasa type, it'll only be re-fetched every day unless you force it.
        * You can also force a specific gallery to be re-fetched by appending ``refresh`` to the gallery url
        * You can manually refresh all galleries on the site by typing in a url like ``mysite.com/refresh_all_galleries``  This means you can also setup a cron-like job to refresh all the galleries whenever you want to just so it isn't done while a user is trying to render a page.
        
        This product's inspired usage was for the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh.

        0.7rc1
        -------
        * added "Refresh Gallery" button in case you change a gallery and need to re-cook the gallery images before it automatically does it for you.  Especially useful for reordering of images in a basic gallery.
        * added go to image support via url like /url/to/gallery?start_image=theTitle. Not exactly perfect, but should work most of the time.  No other way to know what image it is since I don't keep ids on flickr and picasa galleries.  make sure to url encode the title though.
