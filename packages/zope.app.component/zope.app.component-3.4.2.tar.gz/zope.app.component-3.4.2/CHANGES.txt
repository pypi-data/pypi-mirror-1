3.4.2 (2009-07-15)
------------------

- Fix empty __bases__ on LocalSiteManager objects loaded from old databases,
  which causes queryNextUtility to never see global utilites and therefore
  broke minor things like the whole authentication framework.
- Fix KeyError: 'base' on startup in zope/app/component/back35.py after
  an inept attempt to fix the above error.


3.4.1 (2007-10-31)
------------------

- Resolve ``ZopeSecurityPolicy`` deprecation warning.


3.4.0 (2007-10-11)
------------------

- Initial release independent of the main Zope tree.
