        3.6.0 (2009-01-31)
        ------------------
        
        - Moved the implementation of the <class> directive from this package to
        `zope.security`.  In particular, the module
        `zope.app.component.contentdirective` has moved to
        `zope.security.metaconfigure`, and a compatibility import has been
        left in its place.
        
        - Extracted `zope.site` from zope.app.component with backwards
        compatibility imports in place. Local site related functionality
        is now in `zope.site` and packages should import from there.
        
        - Remove more deprecated on 3.5 code:
        
        * zope.app.component.fields module that was pointing to the
        removed back35's LayerField.
        * zope.app.component.interface module that was moved to
        zope.component.interface ages ago.
        * zope:content and zope:localUtility directives.
        * zope:factory directive.
        * deprecated imports in zope.component.metaconfigure
        * browser:tool directive and all zope.component.browser
        meta.zcml stuff.
        
        - Remove "back35" extras_require as it doesn't make
        any sense now.
        
        - Remove zope.modulealias test dependency as it is
        not used anywhere.
        
        - Deprecate ISite and IPossibleSite imports from
        zope.app.component.interfaces. They were moved
        to zope.location.interfaces ages ago. Fix imports
        in zope.app.component itself.
        
        3.5.0 (2008-10-13)
        ------------------
        
        - Remove deprecated code slated for removal on 3.5.
        
        3.4.1 (2007-10-31)
        ------------------
        
        - Resolve ``ZopeSecurityPolicy`` deprecation warning.
        
        
        3.4.0 (2007-10-11)
        ------------------
        
        - Initial release independent of the main Zope tree.
