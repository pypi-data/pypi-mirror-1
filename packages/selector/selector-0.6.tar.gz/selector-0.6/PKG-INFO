Description: This distribution provides WSGI middleware
        for "RESTful" mapping of URL paths to WSGI applications.
        There is a very simple optional mini-language for
        path expressions. Alternately we can easily use
        regular expressions directly or even create our own
        mini-language. There are no architecture specific features
        (to MVC or whatever). Neither are there any framework
        specific features. Best of all, selector is the simplest
        thing that will work well (IMHO).
