Description: This distribution provides WSGI middleware
        for "RESTful" mapping of URLs to WSGI applications.
        There is no custom mini-language to learn; regexes are used.
        There are no architecture specific features (to MVC or whatever).
        Neither are there any framework specific features.
        Best of all, selector is the simplest thing that will work well.
