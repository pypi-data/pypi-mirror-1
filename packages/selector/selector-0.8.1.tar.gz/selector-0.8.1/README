== tryme.py ==

I sort of threw this in as a way to do manual tests. It uses flup.
Flup is not in the dependencies but if you want to run tryme.py you
will need to install it (easy_install should do.) You will also need
a SCGI supporting web server to front it with. I am planning to add a 
twill script to automate running this and remove the need for flup and
a web server. Also tryme.py could use some fleshing out. That will be
done with and for the proposed twill script.
