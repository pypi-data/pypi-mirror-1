Description: There are various other packages that do the same thing in various but similar ways and they are integrated into various frameworks to various degrees. This is the particular way that seems best to me at the time of this writing. The goals are to support "RESTful" url mapping as WSGI middleware for maximum interop,without a custom mini-language (rather just regexes), or being architecture specific (to MVC or whatever), or being (even worse) framework specific. The best thing about selector is how simple it is.
