I use Inkscape to view the SVGs and turn them into pngs.

All tests are consistency tests (since these were easier to write).
If you make changes then run the tests, see which ones fail, compare
the versions in the temp folder to those in the consistency folder 
and if the change look good copy the temp folder versions to the 
consistency folder version.
