Description: =============================================================
        zodbupdate - Update existing databases to match your software
        =============================================================
        
        This package provides a tool that automatically identifies and updates
        references from persistent objects to classes that are in the process of being
        moved from one module to another and/or being renamed.
        
        If a class is being moved or renamed, you need to update all references from
        your database to the new name before finally deleting the old code.
        
        This tool looks through all current objects of your database, identifies
        moved/renamed classes and `touches` objects accordingly. It creates a single
        transaction that contains the update of your database.
        
        Having run this tool, you are then free to delete the old code.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Installing the egg of this tool provides a console script `zodbupdate` which
        you can call giving either a FileStorage filename or a configuration file
        defining a storage::
        
        $ zodbupdate -f Data.fs
        $ zodbupdate -c zodb.conf
        
        Detailed usage information is available:
        
        $ zodbupdate -h
        
        Custom software/eggs
        --------------------
        
        It is important to install this egg in an interpreter/environment where your
        software is installed as well. If you're using a regular Python installation
        or virtualenv, just installing the package using easy_install should be fine.
        
        If you are using buildout, installing can be done using the egg recipe with
        this configuration::
        
        [buildout]
        parts += zodbupdate
        
        [zodbupdate]
        recipe = zc.recipe.egg
        eggs = zodbupdate
        <list additional eggs here>
        
        If you do not install `zodbupdate` together with the necessary software it
        will report missing classes and not touch your database.
        
        Non-FileStorage configurations
        ------------------------------
        
        You can configure any storage known to your ZODB installation by providing a
        ZConfig configuration file (similar to zope.conf). For example you can connect
        to a ZEO server by providing a config file `zeo.conf`::
        
        <zeoclient>
        server 127.0.0.1:8100
        storage 1
        </zeoclient>
        
        And then running `zodbupdate` using:
        
        $ zodbupdate -c zeo.conf
        
        
        Pre-defined rename rules
        ------------------------
        
        Rename rules can be defined using entry points::
        
        setup(...
        entry_points = """
        [zodbupdate]
        renames = mypackage.mymodule:rename_dict
        """)
        
        Rename rules are dictionaries that map old class names to new class names::
        
        renames = {'mypackage.mymodule ClassName':
        'otherpackage.othermodule OtherClass'}
        
        Changes
        =======
        
        0.2 (2009-06-23)
        ----------------
        
        - Add option to store the rename rules into a file.
        
        - Don't commit transactions that have no changes.
        
        - Load rename rules from entry points ``zodbupdate``.
        
        - Compatibility with Python 2.4
        
        - Rename from ``zodbupgrade`` to ``zodbupdate``.
        
        - Add 'verbose' option.
        
        - Improve logging.
        
        - Suppress duplicate log messages (e.g. if the same class is missing in
        multiple objects).
        
        - Improve the updating process: rewrite pickle opcodes instead of blindly
        touching a class. This also allows updating pickles that can't be unpickled
        due to missing classes.
        
        0.1 (2009-06-08)
        ----------------
