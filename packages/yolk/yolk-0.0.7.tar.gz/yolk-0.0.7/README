Summary
-------

Yolk is a Python tool and library for obtaining information about packages installed by distutils, setuptools and easy_install and packages on PyPI (Python Package Index a.k.a. The Cheese Shop). 

Yolk can list all the packages installed by setuptools on your system, show which packages are active, non-active or in development mode and show you which have newer versions available according to PyPI. 

Usage Examples::

    $ yolk -l
         List all installed Python packages

    $ yolk -a 
         List only the activated packages installed (Activated packages are normal packages on sys.path you can import) 

    $ yolk -n 
         List only the non-activated (--multi-version) packages installed 
         
    $ yolk -l -f License,Author nose
         Show the license and author for the package `nose`

    $ yolk --entry-map nose
         Show entry map for the nose package

    $ yolk --entry-points nose.plugins
         Show all setuptools entry points for nose.plugins


These options query PyPI::

    $ yolk -U
         Finds all packages installed via setuptools then checks PyPI for newer releases. 

    $ yolk -M Paste==1.0 
         Show all the metadata for Paste version 1.0 

    $ yolk -M Paste 
         Show all the metadata for each version of Paste listed on PyPi

    $ yolk -D cheesecake 
         Show all URL's for cheesecake packages you can download 

     $ yolk -T source -D cheesecake 
         Show only source code releases for cheesecake 

     $ yolk -H twisted 
         Launches your web browser at Twisted's home page
