You can install yolk with ``easy_install yolk`` or install from the `subversion repository <http://anonymous@tools.assembla.com/svn/yolk/trunk/#egg=yolk-dev>`_ with ``easy_install yolk==dev``.

Gentoo users can use the ebuild in my `overlay <http://overlays.gentoo.org/dev/pythonhead/wiki>`_

Summary
-------

Yolk is a Python library and command-line tool for obtaining information about packages installed by setuptools and packages on PyPI (Python Package Index a.k.a. The Cheese Shop). 

Yolk can list all the packages installed by setuptools on your system, show which packages are active, non-active or in development mode and show you which have newer versions available. 

Usage Examples::

    $ yolk -n 
         List only the non-activated (--multi-version) packages installed 
         
    $ yolk -a 
         List only the activated packages installed (Activated packages are normal packages on sys.path you can import) 

    $ yolk -l
         List all installed package 

    $ yolk -l -f License,Author 
         Show the license and author for each installed package 

These options query PyPI::

    $ yolk -U
         Finds all packages installed via setuptools then checks PyPI for newer releases. 

    $ yolk -M Paste 1.0 
         Show all the metadata for Paste version 1.0 

    $ yolk -M Paste 
         Show all the metadata for each version of Paste listed on PyPi? 

    $ yolk -D cheesecake 
         Show all URL's for cheesecake packages you can download 

     $ yolk -T source -D cheesecake 
         Show only source code releases for cheesecake 

     $ yolk -H twisted 
         Launches your web browser at Twisted's home page
