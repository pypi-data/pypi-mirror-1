Description: Papyros is a small platform independent parallel processing Python package,
        providing a master-slave model. Clients can submit jobs to a master object which
        is monitored by one or more slave objects that do the real work. Two main
        implementations are provided, one using multiple threads and one multiple
        processes in one or more hosts (through [http://pyro.sourceforge.net/ Pyro]).
        The primary design goal is simplicity: a user can replace a time consuming loop
        in a single-thread single-process program with the equivalent parallel version
        in a few lines of code, with minimal boilerplate overhead.
