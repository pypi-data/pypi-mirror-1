==============================
 Using Schevo with TurboGears
==============================

`Schevo`_ is a non-SQL database library developed by Orbtech, L.L.C. and
contributors.

.. _Schevo: http://schevo.org/

If you use Schevo, you will lose access to fastdata. This could be
fixed by adding Schevo-knowledgable conditions to the RuleDispatch
checks in ``formmaker.py``. You will also lose the use of
CatWalk/ModelDesigner and will have to explicitly call transactions in
your controller (Schevo transactions are not implicit).

This document covers the Schevo 3.0 trunk.

Configuration
-------------

This section describes how to set up Schevo so that it will use a seperate
config in development and production mode.

Insert the following into your ``devcfg.py`` and ``prodcfg.py`` files::

  schevo.dbfile = 'your-db-filename.db'

Now flip over to your ``<project>/model.py`` file and replace the contents
with::

  from schevogears.database import package_database
  db = package_database()

With those lines, you're ready to go.
