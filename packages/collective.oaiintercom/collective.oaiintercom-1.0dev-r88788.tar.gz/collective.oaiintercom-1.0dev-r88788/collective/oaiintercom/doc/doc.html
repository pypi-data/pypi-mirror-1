            <p>
               This product is an implementation of OAI-PMH metadata interchange protocol. It is based on Zope views that
               permits the application of Software Engineering to Plone Products. In this case we have decided to develop a simple
               class diagram because it's very simple.
            </p>
            <p>
               The objective for this Plone product is to create an OAI gate in Plone (and educommons) for harvesters and
                distributed searches that provides good interconnectivity. There are other products like ZOpenArchives but it
                is a
               Zope library. We are trying to make a simple plug n play OAI capabilities for many projects because we would like
               to make an interoperable XML platform.
            </p>

            <a name="install"><h2>Install</h2></a>
               For install the software release the product under <b>Plone Products</b> directory. It does not need to install the
               product from <b>Site Setup</b> because it uses Zope views. For access to OAI gate visit http://HOST:PORT/Plone/oai. 
               If you want to test it use http://re.cs.uct.ac.za/ or use greenstone software to harvest the repository.

               <a name="howuse"><h2>How to use</h2></a>
               <p>
               There are too many ways to use this product. One of them is use a repository harvester like greenstone. It is 
               a desktop software written in Java to make library collections and it works with our Plone Product. 
               </p>
               <p>
               Other way is use a web browser (like firefox, safari or iexplorer) but OAI is not designed for human
               reading, although you would test if it works. For do that in first way you have to install the product. After
               you can visit the page http://localhost/Plone/oai and appear something like that:
               <img src="images/response1.png" />
               It is because you do not send any request to OAI gate. In the next point you can view the verbs.

               <h3>Identify</h3>
               <p>This verb is used for get information about the server. It can be used for identify the repository in a index.
               It don't takes any params.</p>

               <h3>ListMetadataFormats</h3>
               <p>This verb is used for identify differents metadata on the server. In our product we only has implemented oai_dc
               metadata format.</p>
               <p>It could take a param called identifier that propers with <b>Plone object identifier</b>. For example if you
               have an object called "aaa", the identifier for view metadata formats in OAI would be "aaa".
               </p>

               <h3>ListSets</h3>
               <p>This verb is used for watch the courses or directories in a Educommons or Plone site. It don't take any
                params.</p>

               <h3>ListRecords</h3>
               <p>This verb is used for get a list of records between dates. We have one problem with dates because format
               dates in oai are like that: yyyy-mm-dd and Plone has the dates like dd-mm-yyyy and we need to translate it.
               It's very simple and you can see it in the source code. This verb take many params:
               <ul>
                  <li><b>from</b>: It is the start date of the query. It has a format like yyyy-mm-dd.</li>
                  <li><b>until</b>: It is the end date of the query. It has a format like yyyy-mm-dd.</li>
                  <li><b>metadataPrefix</b>: It is the name of metadata format to disseminate. Only support oai_dc.
               </ul>
               </p>
               
               <h3>ListIdentifiers</h3>
               <p>This verb is used to get the headers of the elements in Plone. It takes next params:

               <ul>
               <li><b>from</b>: It is the start date of the query. It has a format like yyyy-mm-dd.</li>
               <li><b>until</b>: It is the end date of the query. It has a format like yyyy-mm-dd.</li>
               <li><b>metadataPrefix</b>: It is the name of metadata format to disseminate. Only support oai_dc.
               </ul>
               </p>
                  <h3>GetRecord</h3>
                  <p>This verb is used for get Dublin Core about one record. It is the hearth of harvesting. It takes next
                  params: </p> 
               <ul>
               <li><b>identifier</b>: It is the identifier in Plone database.</li>
               <li><b>metadataPrefix</b>: It is the metadata format in wich we will diseminate the format.</li>
               
               </ul>
