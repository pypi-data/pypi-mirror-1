Introduction
============

Provides an image field that can crop, zoom or scale the image instead of just scaling it.
It is fully compatible with archetype's way of managing image sizes and cropped images can be accessed the traversal way ( context/image_[size_name]).

See collective/croppingimagefield/README.txt for help and example.
