Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        collective.addtofolder allows users to add content to the folder you are currently in. New content will be creaded "next to" the document you currently see.
        
        This overrides the default plone-behaviour that the 'Add Item..' menu is is only shown when viewing folders or their default pages.
        
        collective.addtofolder provides a configlet for the "Plone Control Panel" to enable/disable this behaviour.
        
        This behaviour used to be default until version 3.0 and was removed since some users consider it as confusing.

        Since the translations of "Add to folder" are still present in Plones po-files this should even work in al languages (tested in english and german).
