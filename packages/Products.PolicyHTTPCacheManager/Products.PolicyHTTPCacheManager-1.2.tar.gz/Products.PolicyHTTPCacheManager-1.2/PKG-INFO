Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        What it does?
        -------------
        
        - Delegates the setting of cache-related HTTP headers to CMF's
        Caching Policy Manager.
        
        - Will remove a previously set Last-Modified header set by code
        inside Zope if you ask it to.
        
        Why?
        ----
        
        - Because we can! *wink*
        
        - It's simpler to make arbitrary content to play with the Caching
        Policy Manager this way. You just associate content that plays
        with the Zope's 'Cacheable' interface to this Caching Manager
        and it will automatically set the HTTP headers at the right
        time.
        
        - Some code inside Zope (namely, FS{Image|File} and OFS.Image)
        will unconditionally set a 'Last-Modified' header. According to
        Geoff Davis this might be harmful when Internet Explorer is
        used so 'Caching Policy Manager' grew a setting to control the
        explicit setting of this header. However there was no way to
        explicitly remove a previously set header.
