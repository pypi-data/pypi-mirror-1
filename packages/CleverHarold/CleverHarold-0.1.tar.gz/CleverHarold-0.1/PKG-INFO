        About the Name
        --------------
        
        The name Clever Harold comes from the Monty Python `Ovine Aviation
        sketch <http://mzonline.com/bin/view/Python/OvineAviationSketch>`_:
        
        ::
        
        Tourist: But where did they get the idea?
        
        Shephrd: From Harold. He's that most dangerous of creatures, a
        clever sheep. 'E's realized that a sheep's life consists of standin'
        around for a few months and then bein' eaten. And that's a depressing
        prospect for an ambitious sheep.
        
        Tourist: Well why don't just remove Harold?
        
        Shephrd: Because of the enormous commercial possibilities if 'e
        succeeds.
