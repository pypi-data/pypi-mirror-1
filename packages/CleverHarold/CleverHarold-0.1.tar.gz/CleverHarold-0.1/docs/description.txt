About the Name
--------------

The name Clever Harold comes from the Monty Python `Ovine Aviation
sketch <http://mzonline.com/bin/view/Python/OvineAviationSketch>`_:

::

  Tourist: But where did they get the idea?

  Shephrd: From Harold. He's that most dangerous of creatures, a
  clever sheep. 'E's realized that a sheep's life consists of standin'
  around for a few months and then bein' eaten. And that's a depressing
  prospect for an ambitious sheep.

  Tourist: Well why don't just remove Harold?

  Shephrd: Because of the enormous commercial possibilities if 'e
  succeeds.
