Additional Middleware
---------------------

And now, here's our list of extra middleware.  We like to call it "The
List with Really Long Titles".


DebugInfo - WSGI Environment as HTML Comment Middleware
=======================================================

This middleware will write the WSGI environment at the end of an HTML
file.


RequestTimer - WSGI Request Time as HTML Text or Comment Middleware
====================================================================

This middleware writes the request processing time to the end of an HTML body element,
optionally as a comment.


ReStructured Text File Publishing Middleware
============================================

This middleware pubilshes reStructuredText_ files.  You supply one or
more derectories, and it will publish any .txt file first rendering it
with the docuitls package.


Markdown Text File Publishing Middleware
========================================

This middleware pubilshes Markdown_ text files.  Like the
reStructuredText publisher, you give it a set of directories, and it
will publish any .txt files in them, first rendering the file contents
using markdown.py_.


Other Fine Software Package Middleware
======================================

When you install the Clever Harold dependancies you get a whole lot of
other great software.  For example, the default project includes
creates sections for a Paste Eval Error middleware and a Static Cling
middleware.
