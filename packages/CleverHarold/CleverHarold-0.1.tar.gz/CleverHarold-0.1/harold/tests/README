Clever Harold Tests Package
===========================

Just a few notes about this package:

- It seems egg safe; the harold setup.py call to setup has both 
'test_suite' and a 'zip_safe' parameters.

- The svn:ignore keyword is set to ignore '*.dsn'; this keeps
potentially sensitive data files out of the repository.  The
'sqlite.dsn' file was added manually.

- DBAPIProvider tests for mysql and postgresql are automatically
excluded from the test suite without the presence of 'mysql.dsn' and
'postgresql.dsn' files in the tests directory.
