	* hepmcview can now read from stdin. Writing generator output to a
	Unix named pipe (fifo) and reading it as an input file with
	hepmcview is particularly cool!

	* Added stdin/stdout reading and writing of HepMC data to the SWIG
	remapping of the IO_GenEvent constructor.

	* Added ability to read multiple HepMC files in one session.

	* Now uses proper Python logging.
