	* Changed build system *again*, since SWIG on SL cannot handle
	elements of the HepMC C++ headers (even after hacking to make
	Python 2.3 distutils support SWIG properly). The build now assumes
	that tarballs are being made on a machine with a good version of
	SWIG, and requires no SWIG to be installed on the target system.

	* Changed build system to use newer Python support m4 macros from
	cryp.to archive.

2008-12-18  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Changed build system to use distutils/setuptools rather than m4
	macros for most things. There is a problem in the distutils SWIG
	support that currently breaks the distcheck target.

	* Mapping pair<GenParticle*,GenParticle*>

	* Added GenEvent.summary() method in Python.

2008-10-26  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added animation, command line options, help and other
	documentation, and first pydot functionality.

	* Added printing out of the event as a human-readable text dump if
	"p" is pressed.

	* hepmcview can now read from stdin. Writing generator output to a
	Unix named pipe (fifo) and reading it as an input file with
	hepmcview is particularly cool!

	* Added stdin/stdout reading and writing of HepMC data to the SWIG
	remapping of the IO_GenEvent constructor.

	* Added ability to read multiple HepMC files in one session.

	* Now uses proper Python logging.
