Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        plone.schemaeditor provides a through-the-web interface for modifying Zope 3
        schemata (interfaces).
        
        Currently there is support for:
        
        * adding and removing fields
        * editing attributes of existing fields
        * reordering fields
        * renaming fields
        
        plone.schemaeditor only handles the actual schema editing.  To be useful, it
        requires some integration code to take care of the following pieces:
        
        * traversing to a schema that is used as the context of the editor
        * persisting schema changes across Zope restarts
        
        See plone.app.dexterity (along with plone.dexterity and plone.supermodel) for
        one approach to this integration.
        
        The following field types (from zope.schema) are currently supported:
        
        * TextLine
        * Text
        * Int
        * Float
        * Bool
        * Password
        * Bytes
        * Datetime
        
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        * Zope 2 (Though the actual forms are z3c.form-based and not Zope 2 dependent, so it shouldn't take
        too much work to refactor to work in Zope 3 as well.)
        * z3c.form
        * plone.z3cform
        
        Despite the name, Plone is not a dependency.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.0a2 - 2009-07-12
        ------------------
        
        * Changed API methods and arguments to mixedCase to be more consistent with
        the rest of Zope. This is a non-backwards-compatible change. Our profuse
        apologies, but it's now or never. :-/
        
        If you find that you get import errors or unknown keyword arguments in your
        code, please change names from foo_bar too fooBar, e.g. add_field() becomes
        addField().
