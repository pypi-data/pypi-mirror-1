Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        plone.app.changeownership as it sounds is a plone package to change objects
        ownership.
        
        Problem
        =======
        
        There is no way in plone to transfer ownership of all objects owned by an user
        to a new user. To delete a plone member in such case is not an option.
        
        
        Solution
        ========
        
        plone.app.changeownership makes easy to transfer ownership from one ore more
        members to a new member.
        
        
        Install
        =======
        
        See docs/INSTALL.txt for a buildout configuration.
        
        You have to install the package from quickinstaller or setup_tool. You will get
        a configlet in the plone control panel named "Change Ownership"
