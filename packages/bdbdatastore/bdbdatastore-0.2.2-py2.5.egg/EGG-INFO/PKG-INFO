Description: bdbdatastore is an alternate datastore backend for App Engine apps. It's far more robust and scalable than the one the development server uses, but not as big and hard to install as HBase and HyperTable based backends. bdbdatastore is intended primarially for use by people who want to host their own App Engine apps, and don't expect datastore load for a single app to exceed what a single server can handle. In the event your app gets too big for bdbdatastore, the migration path to an alternate backend is smooth.
