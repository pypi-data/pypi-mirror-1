Description: 
        boostmpi is a high-quality Python wrapper around the
        `Message Passing Interface <http://mpi-forum.org>`_ (MPI).
        MPI is a standardized interface to libraries such as
        `OpenMPI <http://www.open-mpi.org>`_ and
        `MPICH <http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpich2/>`_
        that provide high-performance inter-process communication
        for distributed-memory computing.
        
        boostmpi uses the
        `Boost.MPI library <www.boost.org/doc/html/mpi.html>`_, which
        gives MPI a very usable C++ interface.
        This C++ interface is then made accessible to Python
        via the
        `Boost.Python library <www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/python/doc/>`_.
        
        boostmpi was originally distributed as part of the
        `Boost C++ library <http://boost.org>`_. This separate
        distribution aims to make the software more accessible.
        
        boostmpi (born as Boost.MPI.Python) was written by
        `Doug Gregor <http://www.osl.iu.edu/~dgregor/>`_
        and is currently maintained by
        `Andreas Kloeckner <http://mathema.tician.de>`_
