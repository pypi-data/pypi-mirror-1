Overview
--------

Chameleon is a generic byte-code compiler for attribute template
languages; it supports macros, includes, interpolation and
internationalization.

The ``chameleon.core`` package implements a language parser API, the
byte-code compiler itself and abstract template classes. It should
only be used directly when implementing a language dialect.

Development
-----------

If you want to use the code directly from trunk (recommended only for
development and testing usage), provide ``chameleon.core==dev`` as your
dependency.
