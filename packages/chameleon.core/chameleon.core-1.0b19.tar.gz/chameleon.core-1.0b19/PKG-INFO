Description: Overview
        --------
        
        Chameleon is a generic byte-code compiler for attribute template
        languages; it supports macros, includes, interpolation and
        internationalization.
        
        The ``chameleon.core`` package implements a language parser API, the
        byte-code compiler itself and abstract template classes. It should
        only be used directly when implementing a language dialect.
        
        Development
        -----------
        
        If you want to use the code directly from trunk (recommended only for
        development and testing usage), provide ``chameleon.core==dev`` as your
        dependency.
        
        The code is maintained in a subversion repository::
        
        svn://svn.repoze.org/svn/chameleon.core

        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.0b19 (released 22/02/2009)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Added slight optimization to code transformer to avoid a second call
        on the dynamic scope object. [malthe]
        
        - Fixed bug where variable definition scope would not be
        honored. [malthe]
        
        1.0b18 (released 19/02/2009)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Added support for cancelling an escape by offering a ``__html__``
        method. [malthe]
        
        - Fixed issue where namespace prefix would not be recognized if
        defined below another namespace definition. [malthe]
        
        - Simplifed escaping routine; we only care about the classic three
        entities. [malthe]
        
        - Escape default translation content. [malthe]
        
        - Translation of ``None`` should return ``None``. [malthe]
        
        - Omit the element that defines a slot, if it's filled. [malthe]
        
        1.0b17 (released 13/02/2009)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Use ``tempfile.mkstemp`` to better garden temporary files. [malthe]
        
        - Fixed issue where ``auto_reload`` would have no effect. [malthe]
        
        - In debug-mode, source code is now written to disk, enabling us to
        load (compile) it with ``imp.load_source`` instead of ``exec. This
        allows pdb to step into the source code just like any other
        file-based module. [malthe]
        
        1.0b16 (released 12/02/2009)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Parse templates only when needed, unless the environment variable
        'CHAMELEON_EAGER' is set. [malthe]
        
        - Correctly report back if the document is empty. [malthe]
        
        - Fixed bug that prevented the parsing of XML fragments if they were
        separated by comments. [malthe]
        
        - Improved feedback on XML parsing errors. [malthe]
        
        1.0b15 (released 29/01/2009)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Fixed issue where attributes would be included for a foreign
        namespace even though they were not part of that namespace. [malthe]
        
        - Include (render) "foreign" namespace definitions in macros. [malthe]
        
        - Support macro definitions on elements with METAL prefix. [malthe]
        
        - Comments outside the root element get ignored (LP #317893). [sidnei]
        
        - Set the template as __traceback_info__ in render_template, so that
        for Zope 2/3 it shows up whenever an exception happens, making it
        easier to diagnose what's the failing template in cases where many
        templates and macros are being used to render a page. [sidnei]
        
        - Verify that macros exist when accessed using the
        dictionary-interface of the ``Macros`` object (LP #317572). [malthe]
        
        - Restructured compilation step such that templates are always parsed
        on source write, instead of 'just-in-time' before compilation. This
        will enable us to query the parsed template separately from
        compilation. [malthe]
        
        - Added ``pass`` statement to guarantee valid block
        structure (LP #312597). [malthe]
        
        - Raise ``KeyError`` instead of ``ValueError`` when a macro cannot be
        found. [malthe]
        
        - Removed Zope security configuration. [malthe]
        
        - Do not depend on component configuration. [malthe]
        
        - Make tests pass under Python 2.4 [chrism]
        
        1.0b14 (released 18/12/2008)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Changed a try-except-finally construct into two nested try-except
        clause to retain Python 2.4 compatibility. [cguardia]
        
        1.0b13 (released 15/12/2008)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Fixed handling of static attributes on foreign elements. [malthe]
        
        - Handle the case where the XML declaration does not have an
        encoding. [malthe]
        
        - Introduced new environment flag 'CHAMELEON_SOURCE' which determines
        whether the source-code should be written to disk before
        compilation. [malthe]
        
        - Ignore comments that appear before a root element. [malthe]
        
        - Issue a better error message if the expat parser has not been
        properly initialized. [malthe]
        
        - Merge adjacent strings in write-method. [malthe]
        
        - Added version-control to file cache. This facilitates cache
        invalidation on package upgrades. [malthe]
        
        - Don't flush writes manually; instead, make sure all writes use the
        `out` method and flush whenever `write` is used. This should prevent
        consecutive writes (grouping them into one, instead). [malthe]
        
        - Removed support for selectors bound to elements at compile-time. The
        motivation for this functionality was to implement Genshi match
        templates, however, incorrectly as it turns out. [malthe]
        
        1.0b12 (released 03/12/2008)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Support template fragments, e.g. documents with more than one
        root element. [malthe]
        
        - Added namespace prefix 'xml' to default namespace mapping. [malthe]
        
        - Fixed root cause of issue with self-closing tags; an empty element
        text is now correctly differentiated from a self-closed
        tag (which does not have this attribute set). [malthe]
        
        - Removed support for compilation without ``lxml``. [malthe]
        
        - Use ``xml.parsers.expat`` to parse template document instead of
        using ``lxml``. This gives much greater control over edge-cases and
        allows us to lose many workarounds. [malthe]
        
        - Do not use XPath-expressions during compilation if lxml is not
        available. [malthe]
        
        - Ensure argument uniqueness for macro functions over the combined set of
        scope and keyword arguments. [hannosch]
        
        - Protect all `itertools.chain` statements with an encapsulating set() to
        ensure uniqueness. [hannosch]
        
        1.0b11 (released 29/11/2008)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Ensure that function arguments passed into macros are unique. [hannosch]
        
        - Removed unused imports, thanks to PyFlakes. [hannosch]
        
        - Removed warning about utf-8 as a recommend default encoding. There is no
        apparent speed improvement anymore. [hannosch]
        
        - Use ``sourcecodegen`` package to generate Python-code from AST; this
        is done to avoid generating code using the ``compiler.pycodegen``
        module, which has serious issues. Interestingly, this approach cuts
        compilation time in half. [malthe]
        
        - Bind code-generation utilities in closure as well. [malthe]
        
        - Reworked global scope initialization; we now bind these using a
        closure. [malthe]
        
        - Reworked repeat-variable logic. An iterator would be realized at any
        rate, so let's not try to be clever. [malthe]
        
        - Made repeat-variable work with iterables which do not announce their
        length before execution. [malthe]
        
        - Added namespace attribute support. [malthe]
        
        - Static attributes are now computed such that attributes are omitted
        according to a `ns_omit` flag, and they are always prefixed
        according to the element's `nsmap`. [malthe]
        
        - Do not fix-up self-closing tags if an XML declaration is present
        without a DOCTYPE. [malthe]
        
        - Prefix tags which do not belong to the default namespace. [malthe]
        
        1.0b10 (released 24/11/2008)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Do not apply namespace attribute 'xmlns' to root element if not
        set. [malthe]
        
        - Fixed tuple unpacking in repeat loops. [malthe]
        
        - Use a custom simple BufferIO class for the lxml.etree parser instead of
        standard StringIO. [hannosch]
        
        - This was the wrong fix, however; what needed to be changed is that
        the class of the marker isntance must be available at
        module-scope. [malthe]
        
        - Changed generation.marker back to a normal object instance. Otherwise we get
        PicklingError: Can't pickle <class 'chameleon.core.generation.marker'>:
        it's not the same object as chameleon.core.generation.marker. [hannosch]
        
        - Changed two isinstance checks to check for basestring instead of str or
        unicode. [hannosch]
        
        1.0b9 (released 19/11/2008)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Added ``label`` property to expressions; this allows providing a
        human-readable label for values that are going to
        evaluated. [malthe]
        
        - Normalize METAL slot names to ensure they're valid Python variable
        names. Non-valid characters are converted to underscore. [malthe]
        
        - Renamed dynamic scope variable to `econtext` in order to reduce
        compatibility issues with ZPT. [malthe]
        
        - Fixed issue where multiple defines would cause integrity
        issues. [malthe]
        
        - Avoid self-closing tags that are not allowed in transitional
        HTML. [malthe]
        
        - Use custom serialization method to serialize static default
        translation blocks; we can't rely on `lxml` for sane
        output. [malthe]
        
        - Make `default` symbol available to dynamic attribute
        evaluations. [malthe]
        
        - Visit evaluation before assignment in order to support assignments
        that rely on the same name in the dynamic variable scope. [malthe]
        
        - Conditions may now be inverted; this facilitates the bug-fix of an
        issue where omit conditions were multi-part. [malthe]
        
        - Make sure that arguments passed into the `render`-method are
        introduced in every nested scope. [malthe]
        
        - Added translation language to main scope and make sure redefining it
        inside a closure does not cause issues with nested scope
        locals. [malthe]
        
        1.0b8 (released 16/11/2008)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Only pretend to delete variables; this improves performance and
        guarantees that we don't attempt to delete a variables which is used
        in a nested scope (closure). It works, because the code generation
        transform silently drops the delete-statements, but removes them
        from its internal scope dictionary. [malthe]
        
        - Remove variables from scope dictionary upon block exit. [malthe]
        
        - Split out compile-function such that we can always write the source
        code to disk in debug-mode. [malthe]
        
        - Correctly transfer scope to callback-function that will fill macro
        slot contents. Previously, we would precompute fill-slots, but this
        was wrong since it's expected to inherit the scope of the macro
        currently in use. [malthe]
        
        - Made error handler compatible with Python 2.4 [malthe]
        
        - Maintain symbol mappings for joined expressions. [malthe]
        
        1.0b7 (released 15/11/2008)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Fixed interpolation edge where a right curly brace not part of an
        interpolation expression would cancel a succeeding
        interpolation. [malthe]
        
        - Pass `target_language` when using macros. [malthe]
        
        1.0b6 (released 13/11/2008)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - When validating inserted content (in debug-mode), make sure we wrap
        content as a proper HTML document, including HTML entity
        definitions. [malthe]
        
        - If an element does not belong to a known namespace, assume it's the
        default namespace. This change is relevant after the introduction of
        fallback elements. [malthe]
        
        - XML declarations should be printed with or without a doctype
        element, and only if the template includes it. [malthe]
        
        1.0b5 (released 12/11/2008)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Encode code annotations if encoding is required. [malthe]
        
        - Added filename to XML syntax error exception message. [malthe]
        
        - Fixed bug where a template would be wrapped with namespace
        definitions even if an XML header is present. [malthe]
        
        - Added support for fallback element. [malthe]
        
        - Enabled error handler for macro renderer. [malthe]
        
        - Added error handler which adds debugging information to the
        exception object's string output (in debug-mode only). [malthe]
        
        1.0b4 (released 28/10/2008)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Fixed translation issues (see recently added tests). [malthe]
        
        - Refactored string coercion. [malthe]
        
        1.0b3 (released 13/10/2008)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Fixed issue with parsing expression containing curly
        braces. [malthe]
        
        - Added support for unscoped variable assignment. [malthe]
        
        1.0b2 (released 11/10/2008)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Added support for translating dynamic body text (used in
        interpolation expressions). [malthe]
        
        - Added support for macros prebound to keyword arguments. [malthe]
        
        1.0b1 (released 2/10/2008)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Fixed bugs related to temporary variables with loops and
        conditions. [malthe]
        
        - Set default value for `auto-reload` based on the CHAMELEON_DEBUG
        environment variable check. [malthe]
        
        1.0a4 (released 9/29/2008)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Added method to generate unscoped temporary variables.  [malthe]
        
        - Make lxml a hard dependency for now until the lxml-less logic is stable.
        [wichert]
        
        1.0a3 (released 9/26/2008)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - TemplateLoader now checks a default_parser class attribute if no
        parser is specified. [wichert]
        
        1.0a2 (released 9/26/2008)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Added support for dynamic skip condition. [malthe]
        
        - Fixed bug where an AttributeError would be raised when using the
        file cache. [malthe]
        
        1.0a1 (released 9/24/2008)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - First release.
