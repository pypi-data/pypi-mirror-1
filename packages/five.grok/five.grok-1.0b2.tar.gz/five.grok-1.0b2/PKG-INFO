        Introduction
        ------------
        
        `five.grok` is a development layer for Zope 2, based on Grok framework
        concepts.
        
        The development techniques are similar to the ones used with Grok
        framework.
        
        It is based on `grokcore` namespace packages that were factored out of Grok
        framework.
        
        Implemented features
        --------------------
        
        Coming from Grok, the following components are available to Zope 2
        developers:
        
        - Zope 3 Component (Adapter, Global utilities, Subscribers),
        
        - Permissions,
        
        - Views and Viewlets,
        
        - Skins and resources directories,
        
        - Page Templates (using the Zope 2 Page Templates),
        
        - Formlib forms,
        
        - Local sites and local utilities,
        
        - Annotations.
        
        All those components are available with exactly the same syntax than
        in grok. You just have to do::
        
        from five import grok
        
        Instead of::
        
        import grok
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        After adding the dependency to ``five.grok`` in your project, you have
        to load the following ZCML::
        
        <include package="five.grok" />
        
        Note
        ~~~~
        
        ``five.grok`` have some dependencies on Zope 3 eggs. With Zope 2, you
        can fake those dependencies in buildout with the help of
        ``plone.recipe.zope2instance``.
        
        The minium required configuration to install Zope would be::
        
        [zope2]
        recipe = plone.recipe.zope2install
        url = http://www.zope.org/Products/Zope/2.10.8/Zope-2.10.8-final.tgz
        skip-fake-eggs =
        zope.app.publisher
        zope.component
        zope.i18n
        
        And for this release we recommend to pin down the following version in
        your buildout::
        
        grokcore.annotation = 1.0.1
        grokcore.component = 1.7
        grokcore.formlib = 1.1
        grokcore.security = 1.1
        grokcore.site = 1.0.1
        grokcore.view = 1.7
        grokcore.viewlet = 1.0
        five.localsitemanager = 1.1
        # You should remove five.localsitemanager from this list if you use Plone >= 3.3
        martian = 0.11
        zope.app.publisher = 3.5.1
        zope.app.zcmlfiles = 3.4.3
        zope.component = 3.4.0
        zope.i18n = 3.6.0
        zope.securitypolicy = 3.4.1
        
        Zope 2.10 is required as bare minimum.
        
        
        More information
        ----------------
        
        You can refer to the Grok website: http://grok.zope.org/, and the Grok
        documentation: http://grok.zope.org/documentation/.
