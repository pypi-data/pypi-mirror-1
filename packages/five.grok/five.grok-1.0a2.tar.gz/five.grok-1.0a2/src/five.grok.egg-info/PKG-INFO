        Introduction
        ------------
        
        `five.grok` is a development layer for Zope 2, based on Grok framework
        concepts.
        
        The development techniques are similar to the ones used with Grok
        framework.
        
        It is based on `grokcore` namespace packages that were factored out of Grok
        framework.
        
        Implemented features
        --------------------
        
        Coming from Grok, the following components are available to Zope 2
        developers:
        
        - Zope 3 Component (Adapter, Utility, Subscribers),
        
        - Permissions,
        
        - Views and Viewlets,
        
        - Skins and resources directories,
        
        - Page Templates (using the Zope 2 Page Templates),
        
        - Formlib forms.
        
        All those components are available with exactly the same syntax than
        in grok. You just have to do::
        
        from five import grok
        
        Instead of::
        
        import grok
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        After adding the dependency to ``five.grok`` in your project, you have
        to load the following ZCML::
        
        <include package="five.grok" />
        
        Note
        ~~~~
        
        ``five.grok`` have some dependencies on Zope 3 eggs. With Zope 2, you
        can fake those dependencies in buildout by using the option
        ``fake-zope-eggs = true`` of ``plone.recipe.zope2instance``. However,
        ``five.grok`` requires ``zope.component`` 3.4 at least. You can
        exclude that egg by mentioning ``zope.component`` in the option
        ``skip-fake-eggs`` in the same buildout section.
        
        
        More information
        ----------------
        
        You can refer to the Grok website: http://grok.zope.org/, and the Grok
        documentation: http://grok.zope.org/documentation/.
        
        You can check the doctest included in sources as well.
