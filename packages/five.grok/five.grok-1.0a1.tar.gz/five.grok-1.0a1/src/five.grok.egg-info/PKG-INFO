        Introduction
        ------------
        
        `five.grok` is a development layer for Zope 2, based on Grok framework concepts.
        
        The development techniques are similar to the ones used with Grok framework.
        
        It is based on `grokcore` namespace packages that were factored out of Grok
        framework.
        
        
        
        Implemented features
        --------------------
        
        Coming from Grok, the following components are available to Zope 2
        developers:
        
        - Zope 3 Component (Adapter, Utility, Subscribers),
        
        - Permissions,
        
        - Views,
        
        - Page Templates (using the Zope 2 Page Templates),
        
        - Formlib forms.
        
        All those components are available with exactly the same syntax than
        in grok. You just have to do::
        
        from five import grok
        
        Instead of::
        
        import grok
        
        
        More information
        ----------------
        
        You can refer to the Grok website: http://grok.zope.org/, and the Grok
        documentation: http://grok.zope.org/documentation/.
        
        You can check the doctest included in sources as well.
