Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        quintagroup.portlet.cumulus is a Plone product that allows you to add tag cloud
        portlets to your Plone site. Your site's tags (content categories are used as
        tags) are displayed using a Flash movie that rotates them in 3D. It works just
        like a regular tags cloud, but is more visually exciting. This is the WordPress
        WP-Cumulus plugin ported to Plone as a portlet.
        
        When you add this portlet anywhere in the site it will display all site's tags.
        If you have installed QullsEnabled product this portlet will display only blog's
        tags when rendered inside blog.

        FAQ
        ---
        
        From what version of WP-Cumulus WordPress plugin this product was ported?
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        It's ported from WP-Cumulus 1.20.
        
        Some characters are not showing up
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Because of the way Flash handles text, only Latin characters are supported in
        the current version. This is due to a limitation where in order to be able to
        animate text fields smoothly the glyphs need to be embedded in the movie. The
        Flash movie's source code is available for download through Subversion. Doing so
        will allow you to create a version for your language. There's a text field in
        the root of the movie that you can use to embed more characters. If you change
        to another font, you'll need to edit the Tag class as well.
        
        Where can I find more information?
