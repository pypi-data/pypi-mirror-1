Description: =====================
        z3c.recipe.compattest
        =====================
        
        This buildout recipe generates a list of packages to test and a test runner
        that runs each package's tests (isolated from any other tests).
        This is useful to check that the changes made while developing a package
        do not break any packages that are using this package.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Add a part to your buildout.cfg that uses this recipe.
        No further configuration is required, but you can set the following options:
        
        - ``svn_url``: SVN repository to search for packages,
        - ``include``: only packages matching a regex in this list (one regex per line)
        will be included (default:``^zope\..*``, ``^grokcore\..*``),
        - ``exclude``: packages matching any regex in this list will be excluded, even if
        they match ``include`` (default: a list of deprectated/obsolete
        ``zope.*`` packages, see ``z3c.recipe.compattest.recipe`` for
        details),
        - ``script``: the name of the runner script (default: test-compat).
        
        - ``use_svn``: use SVN checkouts instead of releases (see below)
        - ``svn_directory``: directory to place checkouts in (default: parts/<partname>)
        
        >>> cd(sample_buildout)
        >>> write('buildout.cfg', """
        ... [buildout]
        ... parts = compattest
        ...
        ... [compattest]
        ... recipe = z3c.recipe.compattest
        ... include = z3c.recipe.compattest
        ... """)
        
        For this test, we only include a single package. With the default
        include/exclude values, about 150 packages will be included, so be aware
        that running the buildout will take some time.
        
        >>> print system(buildout)
        Couldn't...Installing compattest...
        
        Details
        =======
        
        The recipe generates a test runner for each package, as well as a global runner
        script (called `test-compat` by default) that will run all of them:
        
        >>> ls('bin')
        - buildout
        - compattest-z3c.recipe.compattest
        - test-compattest
        >>> cat('bin', 'test-compattest')
        #!/...python...
        ...main(...compattest-z3c.recipe.compattest...
        
        We take care about installing the test dependencies for the packages
        (from their ``extras_require['test']``). Do demonstrate this, we
        declared a (superfluous) test dependency on ``zope.dottedname``, which is
        picked up:
        
        >>> cat('bin', 'compattest-z3c.recipe.compattest')
        #!/...python...
        ...zope.dottedname...
        
        Using SVN checkouts
        ===================
        
        When you set ``use_svn`` to true, the test runners will not refer to released
        eggs, but rather use development-egg links to SVN checkouts of the trunks of
        each package (the checkouts are placed in ``svn_directory``).
        
        Note: Even though the generated testrunners will use development-egg links, this
        does not change the develop-eggs for your buildout itself. We check that before
        the installation of the recipe, there's just the single develop-egg link of the
        package we're working on:
        
        >>> ls('develop-eggs')
        - z3c.recipe.compattest.egg-link
        
        >>> write('buildout.cfg', """
        ... [buildout]
        ... parts = compattest-trunk
        ...
        ... [compattest-trunk]
        ... recipe = z3c.recipe.compattest
        ... include = zope.dottedname
        ...           z3c.recipe.compattest
        ... use_svn = true
        ... """)
        >>> ignore = system(buildout)
        
        The checkouts are placed in the ``parts/`` folder by default, but you can
        override this by setting ``svn_directory`` -- so you can share checkouts
        between several buildouts, for example.
        
        Note that for packages that already exist as develop eggs (in our example,
        z3c.recipe.compattest), no checkout is performed.
        
        >>> ls('parts/compattest-trunk')
        d zope.dottedname
        
        The testrunner uses the checked out version of zope.dottedname:
        
        >>> cat('bin', 'compattest-trunk-zope.dottedname')
        #!/...python...
        ...parts/compattest-trunk/zope.dottedname/src...
        
        But no additional develop-egg links are present:
        
        >>> ls('develop-eggs')
        - z3c.recipe.compattest.egg-link

        ================
        
        - Ignore missing package releases for packages listed in Subversion (as
        long as we don't try to run from Subversion).
        
        - Allow parallel execution of the individual test runners by stating
        'max_jobs=X' in the recipe's options.
        
        0.3 (2009-01-28)
        ================
        
        - Adding the exclude parameter in buildout causes the default exclude
        list to be merged with the option in buildout.cfg.
        
        0.2 (2009-01-28)
        ================
        
        - Implemented use_svn option to use SVN trunk checkouts instead of released
        versions.
        
        0.1 (2009-01-28)
