0.8 (2009-08-17)
================

- Windoes is now supported.

- Changed the default master script name to the part name. (Don't add
  a "test-" prefix any more.)


0.7 (2009-08-13)
================

- Simplified building the list of packages even more: we now just take a list of
  packages, period.

0.6 (2009-08-07)
================

- Restructured the way we construct our list of packages to test:
  We no longer filter a list we retrieved from SVN with includes/excludes,
  but use an explicit list that can be populated from a buildout section,
  e. g. [versions]. Thus, we can now easily test against a KGS.
- Always enable all extras of packages under test.

0.5 (2009-01-29)
================

- Fix duplicate `url` parameter in setup.py that confused Python 2.4 but
  got accepted by Python 2.5.

0.4 (2009-01-29)
================

- Ignore missing package releases for packages listed in Subversion (as
  long as we don't try to run from Subversion).

- Allow parallel execution of the individual test runners by stating
  'max_jobs=X' in the recipe's options.

0.3 (2009-01-28)
================

- Adding the exclude parameter in buildout causes the default exclude
  list to be merged with the option in buildout.cfg.

0.2 (2009-01-28)
================

- Implemented use_svn option to use SVN trunk checkouts instead of released
  versions.

0.1 (2009-01-28)
================

- first released version
