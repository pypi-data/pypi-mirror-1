Description: 
        bvp_solver is a Python package for solving two-point boundary value problems that wraps
        BVP_SOLVER (see http://cs.stmarys.ca/~muir/BVP_SOLVER_Webpage.shtml). It is currently fully
        working and mostly complete, but it is still being documented and improved. A quick start
        guide and some example can be found at: http://bvp-solver.wikidot.com. If you have questions
        or suggestions send an e-mail to the mailing list or me.
        
        bvp_solver is intended to eventually be BSD licensed so that it may be included in SciPy,
        but BVP_SOLVER currently relies on COLROW which is subject to ACM license which prohibits
        free commercial use. One of the creators of the BVP_SOLVER Fortran code has informed me that
        he believes he can create a free algorithm that accomplishes the same thing.
