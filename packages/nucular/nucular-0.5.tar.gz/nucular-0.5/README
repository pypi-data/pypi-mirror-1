NUCULAR README
==============
Nucular is a system for creating full text indices for fielded data. 
It can be accessed via a Python API or via a suite of command line 
interfaces.

Nucular archives fielded documents and retrieves them based on field 
value, field prefix, field word prefix, or full text word prefix, 
word proximity or combinations of these. Nucular also includes 
features for determining values related to a query often called 
query facets.

FEATURES
========

Nucular is very light weight. Updates and accesses do not require 
any server process or other system support such as shared memory 
locking.

Nucular supports concurrency. Arbitrary concurrent updates and 
accesses by multiple processes or threads are supported, with 
no possible locking issues.

Nucular supports document threading in the manner of USENET 
replies. Built in semantics allows "follow ups" to messages to 
match patterns that match the "original" messages.

Nucular indexes and retrieves data quickly. 

NEWS
====

Nucular now supports WIN32. Current releases of Nucular abstract 
the file system in order to emulate file system feature missing 
on NT file systems which prevented older versions from running 
correctly on Windows NT based systems.

Proximity search added: Current versions of Nucular allow queries 
to search for a sequence of words near eachother separated by 
no more than a specified number or other words.

Faceted suggestions: Nucular queries now support faceted 
suggestions for values for fields which are related to a query.

Faster index builds: Current releases of Nucular have completely 
revamped internal data structures which build indices much faster 
(and query a bit faster also). For example some builds run more 
than 8 times faster than previously. 

CAVEATS
=======

Updates must be combined into optimized index structures on
a periodic basis using "aggregation" operations.  Failure to
aggregate too many updates will result in performance degradation.

LICENSE
=======

Nucular may be used and copied under the BSD/style open source
license.
