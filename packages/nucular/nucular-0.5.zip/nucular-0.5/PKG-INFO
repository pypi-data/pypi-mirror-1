Description: 
        Nucular is a system for creating full text indices for fielded data.
        It can be accessed via a Python API or via a suite of command line interfaces.
        
        Nucular archives fielded documents and retrieves them based on field value,
        field prefix, field word prefix, or full text word prefix, word proximity or
        combinations of these. Nucular also includes features for determining values
        related to a query often called query facets.
        
        Features
        
        Nucular is very light weight. Updates and accesses do not require any
        server process or other system support such as shared memory locking.
        
        Nucular supports concurrency. Arbitrary concurrent updates and accesses
        by multiple processes or threads are supported, with no possible locking issues.
        
        Nucular is pure Python.
        Nucular indexes and retrieves data quickly.
        Nucular has a funny name.
