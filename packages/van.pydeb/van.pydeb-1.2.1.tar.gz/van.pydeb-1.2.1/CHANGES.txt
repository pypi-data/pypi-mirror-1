Changes
=======

1.2.1 (2009-06-15)
------------------

* Add mapping for ZConfig and RestrictedPython.
* Change default Debian binary to python package name conversion. The original
  package name will be used if there is no python-prefix. This works with
  packages such as buildbot which do not include the python-. The previous
  version errored in this case, so we're backwards compatible :)

1.2.0 (2009-05-29)
------------------

* Improve README.txt. Thanks to Fabio Tranchitella for a better looking way of
  calling van-pydeb in the rules file.
* Expose version and package name conversion functions via the command line interface.
  e.g. This command will print out the debian binary package name::

    $ van-pydeb py_to_bin foo

1.1.0 (2009-05-26)
------------------

* Obligatory "How could I have done that" release smoothing out documentation
  bugs and making the command line options more complete.

1.0.0 (2009-05-26)
------------------

* Initial Release.
