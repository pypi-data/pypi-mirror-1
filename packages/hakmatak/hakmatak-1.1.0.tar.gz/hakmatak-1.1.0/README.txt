Hakmatak is a python implementation of the Webification (w10n) specification.

The core idea of webification is to make inner components of a data store
(composite file, database, etc.) directly addressable and accessible
via well-defined and meaningful URLs. A short tech note of w10n
is available as ./doc/w10n.txt. To learn more about w10n, please visit
http://w10n.org.

Hakmatak can be used to create WSGI or CGI applications that provide
RESTful w10n web services. Useful command line tools are included as well.
To install and configure Hakmatak, please read ./INSTALL.txt.

Hakmatak is extensible by design. To extend Hakmatak for new data store types,
please read ./doc/dev.txt. A list of Hakmatak-based applications is maintained
at http://hakmatak.org.
