:Release: 0.2
:Date: 2006/08/12

Purpose
-------

A python script to generate a cscope index from a Python source
tree.  `pycscope` uses Python's own parser and AST to generate
the index, so it is a bit more accurate than plain cscope.

Usage
-----

::

    pycscope.py [-R] [-f reffile] [source files]
    -R              Recurse directories for files.
    -f reffile      Use reffile as cross-ref file name instead of cscope.out.

Install
-------

PyCscope uses Python's distutils package for installation.
Use the following command to install this package::

    % python setup.py install

Features
--------

PyCscope has the following features:

    - Command line interface
    - Output can be used by the `CscopeFinder` plugin for jEdit
    - Marks for all files ending in `.py`
    - Marks for all `class` definitions
    - Marks for all defined functions
    - Marks for function calls (algorithm is not perfect)
    - Marks for end-of-function (no search uses this mark yet)
    - Marks for imported modules (use the search for #include)

A *mark* is an indicator to the cscope utility that something
of interest follows.

Status
------

It works well enough to generate an index file that can be used
by the `CscopeFinder` plugin for jEdit.  Other editors are not tested.
