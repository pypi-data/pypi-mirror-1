Description: Installation
        ============
        
        Install the ``django-templatequery`` package from the Python Package Index with
        one of the following commands::
        
        easy_install django-templatequery
        
        *or*::
        
        pip intall django-templatequery
        
        If you want to use the templatetags that come with **django-templatequery** you
        need to put ``'django_templatequery'`` to the end of your ``INSTALLED_APPS``
        setting.
        
        Please note: It maybe is a risk to make the templatetags available for template
        designers. It is possible that they have access to models which they shouldn't
        have. Only do this if you trust the people that work on your templates!
