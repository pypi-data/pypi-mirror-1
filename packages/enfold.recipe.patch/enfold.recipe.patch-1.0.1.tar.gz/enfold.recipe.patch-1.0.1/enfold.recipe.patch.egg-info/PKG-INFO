        Supported options
        =================
        
        patch-binary
        Path to the ``patch`` program. Defaults to 'patch' which should
        work on any system that has the ``patch`` program available in the
        system ``PATH``.
        
        patch-options
        Options passed to the ``patch`` program. Defaults to ``-p0``.
        
        patches
        List of patch directories to be searched and then applied to the
        extracted source. Each file should be given on a separate
        line. The patch files prefix (up to the first '-') will be used to
        match the patch file to the target directory. Accepts globbing.
        
        target
        List of directories to be searched for names matching the found
        patch files. For each matching directory/patch combination, the
        patch will be applied in place.
