* Subcategories need to be recataloged after having their parent categroies type restrictions changed.

* Deleting Attributes and Categories

  This will cause any content type that is using the deleted item to have references that are blank.  They show up as empty slots in the widgets.

* CategoryWidget

  The current widget will loose user selections if there is a form submission error or even if they use the back and forward buttons.

* Optimizing CategoryManager

  It is very expensive grabbing categories.  Coming up with a better way to handle grabbing areas of the category tree is critical for large trees.

* Archetypes Data-model to Heavy

  Currently attributes and categories are based on Archetypes.  I think this
  is probably a heavy weight solution.  Coming up with a different datamodel
  would be a good idea.

* Content type icons

  The current content type icons are not very Plone like.  would be nice to make some that fit right in.

* Attributes associated with Categories

  Might be nice to allow attribute collections to be associated with categories and then associate those attributes with content types that select those categories.

* SetupWidget 

  Move customizations currently in Install.py to a SetupWidget.
