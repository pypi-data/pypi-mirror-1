Description: GtkEggDeps
        ==========
        
        GtkEggDeps uses the wonderful tl.eggdeps and PyGtk to provide an interactive
        dependency browser.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        If you have easy_install, you should be able to easy_install gtkeggdeps.
        
        Alternatively, download gtkeggdeps.py and use it directly. You'll need to have
        tl.eggdeps installed.
        
        The source code can be found in this Bazaar repository:
        http://mg.pov.lt/gtkeggdeps/bzr
        
        The project home page is at http://mg.pov.lt/gtkeggdeps
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        You can pass a list of egg names on the command line to limit the view just to
        those eggs and their dependencies.  You can also specify package names to
        completely ignore.  Run gtkeggdepps --help for the syntax.
        
        The standard Gtk+ keys for navigating trees are
        
        =========== ================================================================
        '+'         expand a tree node
        '-' or '/'  collapse a tree node
        '*'         expand a tree node recursively
        Backspace   jump to parent
        Ctrl+S      start incremental search among expanded nodes
        Ctrl+Up     find previous matching node
        Ctrl+Down   find next matching node
        =========== ================================================================
        
        Extra keys defined by gtkeggdeps
        
        =========== ================================================================
        Enter       expand/collapse a node
        =========== ================================================================
        
        The colours are:
        
        =========== ================================================================
        red         This is a dependency loop
        blue        There exists a dependency to this package that is less indirect
        (e.g. if z3c.formdemo directly depends on zope.schema, then
        whenever zope.schema appears as an indirect dependency it will
        be in blue).  Blue nodes aren't expanded recursively when you
        press '*', but they can be expanded with '+'.
        grey        This package is not available in your working set
        =========== ================================================================
        
        The meaning of brackets are:
        
        =========== ================================================================
        (name)      This package is incompatible with the rest (due to a version
        conflict somewhere)
        {name}      This package is not available
        =========== ================================================================
        
        
        Usage with zc.buildout
        ----------------------
        
        Add a new part to buildout.cfg that uses zc.recipe.egg and installs gtkeggdeps
        together with the eggs whose dependencies you want to explore. Example for
        z3c.formdemo::
        
        [buildout]
        develop = .
        parts = demo test coverage eggdeps
        
        [eggdeps]
        recipe = zc.recipe.egg
        eggs = gtkeggdeps
        z3c.formdemo [app, test]
        
        ...
        
        Rerun buildout and you'll get a bin/gtkeggdeps script that will see all the
        eggs you specified.
        
        
        Known bugs
        ----------
        
        * If there's a dependency loop and there are no packages depending on at
        least one package participating in that loop, the whole loop will be
        excluded from the output.
        
        * If you specify requirements on the command line, you may see extras in
        the tree that don't have dependency information loaded.
