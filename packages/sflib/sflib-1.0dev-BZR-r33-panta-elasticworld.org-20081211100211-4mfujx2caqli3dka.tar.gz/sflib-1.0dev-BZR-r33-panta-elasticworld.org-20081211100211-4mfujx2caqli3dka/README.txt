Python sflib
============

A library of (hopefully) useful python modules.

SoftwareFabrica sflib is a library of (hopefully) useful python modules. It
provides support for object-oriented HTML generation, an ultra-simple DOM
library, graph classes and algorithms, object-oriented Patterns, and more.

Your help and feedback is precious. Please get in touch with us for your
suggestions.

If you want to actively collaborate and provide code, documentation, tests or
bug fixes, please feel free to create a new Bazaar branch in Launchpad, and tell
us about it! See the collaboration_ section for more information.

INSTALLATION

You can download and install the most up-to-date version in one step
using EasyInstall_. For example, on a unix-like system:

  $ sudo easy_install sflib

Otherwise you can just download the source package (eg. from PyPI_),
extract it and run the usual ``setup.py`` commands:

::

  $ su
  # python setup.py install
