Description: Python sflib
        ============
        
        A library of (hopefully) useful python modules.
        
        SoftwareFabrica sflib is a library of (hopefully) useful python modules. It
        provides support for object-oriented HTML generation, an ultra-simple DOM
        library, graph classes and algorithms, object-oriented Patterns, and more.
        
        Your help and feedback is precious. Please get in touch with us for your
        suggestions.
        
        If you want to actively collaborate and provide code, documentation, tests or
        bug fixes, please feel free to create a new Bazaar branch in Launchpad, and tell
        us about it! See the collaboration_ section for more information.

        INSTALLATION
        ------------
        
        You can download and install the most up-to-date version in one step
        using EasyInstall_. For example, on a unix-like system:
        
        ::
        
        $ su
        # easy_install sflib
        
        If you are using Ubuntu, to install system-wide:
        
        ::
        
        $ sudo easy_install sflib
        
        Otherwise you can just download the source package (eg. from PyPI_),
        extract it and run the usual ``setup.py`` commands:
        
        ::
        
        $ su
        # python setup.py install
        
        .. _EasyInstall: http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall
        .. _PyPI: http://pypi.python.org/pypi
        
        .. _download:
        
        DOWNLOAD
        --------
        
        If you don't want or cannot install using EasyInstall_, download the
        package from Cheese Shop:
        
        http://pypi.python.org/pypi/sflib/
        
        http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/sflib/
        
        In a future, it will be possible to download also from:
        
        http://www.softwarefabrica.org/projects/sflib/
        
        
        .. _documentation:
        
        DOCUMENTATION
        -------------
        
        Documentation is included in the form of *docstrings*, inside the library source
        code.
        
        For some advanced examples, please see also the included automatic tests.
