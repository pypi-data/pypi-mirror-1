        INSTALLATION
        ------------
        
        You can download and install the most up-to-date version in one step
        using EasyInstall_. For example, on a unix-like system:
        
        ::
        
        $ su
        # easy_install sflib
        
        If you are using Ubuntu, to install system-wide:
        
        ::
        
        $ sudo easy_install sflib
        
        Otherwise you can just download the source package (eg. from PyPI_),
        extract it and run the usual ``setup.py`` commands:
        
        ::
        
        $ su
        # python setup.py install
        
        .. _EasyInstall: http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall
        .. _PyPI: http://pypi.python.org/pypi
        
        DOWNLOAD
        --------
        
        If you don't want or cannot install using EasyInstall_, download the
        package from Cheese Shop:

        In a future, it will be possible to download also from:

        * sflib/version.py (get_version_setuptools): use '-' instead of

        * README.txt: added installation instructions.

        * integrated setuptools support.
