INSTALLATION
------------

You can download and install the most up-to-date version in one step
using EasyInstall_. For example, on a unix-like system:

::

  $ su
  # easy_install sflib

If you are using Ubuntu, to install system-wide:

::

  $ sudo easy_install sflib

Otherwise you can just download the source package (eg. from PyPI_),
extract it and run the usual ``setup.py`` commands:

::

  $ su
  # python setup.py install
