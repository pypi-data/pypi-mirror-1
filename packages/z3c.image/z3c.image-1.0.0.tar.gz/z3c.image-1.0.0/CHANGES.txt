=====================
Changes for z3c.image
=====================

2008/10/15 1.0.0:
=================

- prepare release on pypi

2008/06/17 1.0.0a2:
===================

- increased performance: image processing was always called twice :(
  Should now be twice as fast as before :)

2008/06/15 1.0.0a1:
===================

- increase the major version number because of backward incompatibilities
- changed the way how parameters are processed to make it easier to subclass
  It is now no longer necessary to implement __init__ in subclasses.
  To migrate existing code just set or modify the property "params". "params"
  is a dict like request.form.

2008/02/15 0.1.8:
=================

- bugfix: wrong handling of raw image data im no crop and size info was
          provided


2008/02/14 0.1.7:
=================

- bugfix: resizing did not longer work correctly in release 0.1.6


2008/02/05 0.1.6:
=================

- taking care of allowed image size. That means the resulting iamge size
  will get calculated


2008/01/17 0.1.5:
=================

- do not rely on private attributes in the context
- make sure __init__ doesn't fail if content type is None


2008/01/16 0.1.4:
=================

- keeping aspect ratio if resizing an image after crop


2007/11/09 0.1.3:
=================

- added resize after crop


2007/06/21 0.1.2:
=================

- Prevent ProcessableImage from crashing if image type is unknown.
  If the type is unknown to Zope it is maybe known to PIL.


2007/06/20 0.1.1:
=================

- added a paste processor and a view

- some small refactoring to simplify derived views
