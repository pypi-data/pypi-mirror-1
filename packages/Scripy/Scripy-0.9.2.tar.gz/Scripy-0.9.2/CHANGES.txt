v0.9.2, 2010-02-04
------------------
* Path expansion for commands.
* `Run()` returns a named tuple with `returncode` and `stdout`.
* Nose was capturing all log output so it was not being written to the log file.
* Renamed class `shell.Code()` to `shell.ReturnCode()`. It manages now the valid
  exit status codes (mainly from commands run in the shell).
* Better error catching code and error reporting.
* Changed the logging handler to have rotation of disk log files.
* PyYAML is optional to install.

v0.9, 2010-01-28
----------------
* Initial release.
