v0.9.3, 2010-02-16
------------------
* Use the `platform` module to get information related to the system.
* The logger has been moved to a separated project called *Yamlog*.
* Scripts based on *Scripy* can add more command paths at instantiating
  `scripy.Run()`.
* Fixed `edit.Edit()` to can edit files owned by another user.

v0.9.2, 2010-02-04
------------------
* Path expansion for commands.
* `shell.Run()` returns a named tuple with `returncode` and `stdout`.
* *Nose* was capturing all log output so it was not being written to the log file.
* Renamed class `shell.Code()` to `shell.ReturnCode()`. It manages now the valid
  exit status codes (mainly from commands run in the shell).
* Better error catching code and error reporting.
* Changed the logging handler to have rotation of disk log files.
* *PyYAML* is optional to install.

v0.9, 2010-01-28
----------------
* Initial release.
