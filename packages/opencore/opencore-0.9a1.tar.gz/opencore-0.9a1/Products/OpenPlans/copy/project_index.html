<h3 class="Subheading">Project Home Page</h3>

<p>
This is the home page for your project.  You may edit this text
by using the 'edit' tab that you see at the top of the page.
</p>

<p>
You can add a ((new page)) by enclosing the title of the page
in double parentheses.  This will cause a link to show up immediately
after the text; clicking on this link will create the new page for
you.  If a page with that name already exists, the text will simply
link to that page.
