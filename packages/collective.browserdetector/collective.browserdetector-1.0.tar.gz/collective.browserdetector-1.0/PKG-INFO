        ============
        
        A helper Plone extension which makes easier to include resources specific
        to several types of browsers or platforms.
        
        Installing
        ============
        
        This package requires Plone 3.x or later (should work with 2.5.x also).
        
        Installing without buildout
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Install this package in either your system path packages or in the lib/python
        directory of your Zope instance. You can do this using either easy_install or
        via the setup.py script.
        
        After installing the package it needs to be registered in your Zope instance.
        This can be done by putting a collective.browserdetector-configure.zcml
        file in the etc/package-includes directory with this content::
        
        <include package="collective.browserdetector" />
        
        or, alternatively, you can add that line to the configure.zcml in a package or
        Product that is already registered.
        
        Installing with buildout
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If you are using `buildout`_ to manage your instance installing
        collective.browserdetector is even simpler. You can install
        collective.browserdetector by adding it to the eggs line for your instance::
        
        [instance]
        eggs = collective.browserdetector
        zcml = collective.browserdetector
        
        The last line tells buildout to generate a zcml snippet that tells Zope
        to configure collective.browserdetector.
        
        If another package depends on the collective.browserdetector egg or includes
        its zcml directly you do not need to specify anything in the buildout
        configuration: buildout will detect this automatically.
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run the ''bin/buildout'', which
        will take care of updating your system.

        Usage
        =====
        
        There are several browsers, mostly older releases, which renders websites
        in different way then common browsers of latest versions. So in case
        you need to support these browsers with your website, one possible way
        how to include fixes for their different behaviour is to include individual
        resources targeting specific browsers.
        
        By default Plone includes IEFixes.css file where are fixes / hacks related
        to all IE browsers but what if you need different fixes for each IE version.
        There comes collective.browserdetector in turn.
        
        1. Lazy way (quick & start)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - install browser detector via Quick Installer
        
        - go to ZMI:/portal_skins/collective.browserdetector
        
        - select css module for your browser (by its name) and customize it
        
        - add your css hacks into customized css file
        
        - go to ZMI:/portal_css and register your new resource, see example of generic
        setup configuration:
        
        <stylesheet title=""
        id="IE6.css" media="screen" rel="stylesheet" rendering="import"
        cacheable="True" compression="safe" cookable="True" enabled="1"
        expression="python:portal.restrictedTraverse('@@browser-detector').isIE6"/>
        
        - don't forget to set the right expression, but don't worry the only thing
        which you have to take care is its last part "isIE6" in this example, you
        should use the right detector attribute according to targeting browser (list
        of available detector attributes is included below)
        
        And that's it.
        
        2. Using policy or theme
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - register collective.browserdetector as dependency of your policy package
        (in the metadata.xml profile module)
        
        - include your css files with fixes in the skin layers (you can copy prepared
        css files from collective.browserdetector/collective/browserdetector/skins/
        collective.browserdetector)
        
        - register your css files via generic setup (see collective.browserdetector/
        collective/browserdetector/profiles/default/cssregistry.xml.example
        for an example)
        
        And that's it.
        
        3. Detector attributes
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        isSecure, isWebKit, isOpera, isChrome, isSafari, isSafari3, isSafari4,
        isIE, isIE7, isIE8, isIE6, isGecko, isGecko3, isGecko2, isWindows, isMac,
        isLinux, isSafariOnMac, isSafariOnWin, isGeckoOnMac, isGeckoOnLinux,
        isGeckoOnWin, isOperaOnMac, isOperaOnLinux, isOperaOnWin, isChromeOnMac,
        isChromeOnLinux, isChromeOnWin
        
        For more information see interfaces.py module.
        
        4. Tips
        ~~~~~~~
        
        - you can the detector conditions for kss and javascript resources also
        
        - you can use detector in templates to render different (X)HTML depending
        on browser/platform for example:
        
        <tal:block define="detector context/browser-detector">
        <tal:firefox condition="detector/isGecko">
        HERE COMES THE CODE FOR MOZILLA/FIREFOX
        </tal:firefox>
        
        <tal:ie condition="detector/isIE">
        HERE COMES THE CODE FOR IE
        </tal:ie>
        </tal:block>
        
        
        Additionally you can display browser detection information in the browser
        detector portlet. Go to portlets management page (@@manage-portlets) and add
        new portlet "Browser Detector". Portlet also has a link (in the footer)
        to browser view displaying results of each detection methods.
