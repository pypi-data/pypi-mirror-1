Django HTTP Proxy provides simple HTTP proxy functionality for the Django web
development framework.

One possible use for this application (actually, the reason it was developed)
is to allow for easy development of Ajax applications against a live server
environment. 

For instance, you might be developing an Ajax application which end up running
in an JSP environment. Instead of having to deploy your application on the JSP
server, you can already test against against the live server environment while
you develop. All you need is the Django framework, run `manage.py` and you are
good to go.

Installation instructions can be found in the INSTALL file.
