Thanks for downloading Django HTTP Proxy.

The application has been tested on Python 2.6 with Django 1.1.1, but should
work on earlier releases as well. In addition, the package depends on the
httplib2 python package.

To install, run this command from the command prompt:

    python setup.py install

To automatically install the dependencies using pip, you can run:

	pip install -r requirements/libs.txt
	
Finally, you need to add 'httpproxy' to your installed app in the Django
settings.py file:

	INSTALLED_APPS = (
		...
	    'httpproxy',
	)

To use Django HTTP Proxy, you should create an entry in your urls.py that
forwards requests to the 'httpproxy.views.proxy' view, e.g.:

	urlpatterns += patterns('',
	    (r'^(?P<url>.*)$', 'httpproxy.views.proxy'),
	)
	
Given the above url config, all requests will be forwarded to the proxy view
function. The domain to which the proxy will forward request can be configured
using the PROXY_DOMAIN setting:

	PROXY_DOMAIN = 'www.google.com'

Optionally, you can specify a port number (defaults to 80):

	PROXY_PORT = 8080

Finally, if the server requires Basic HTTP Authentication, you can specify a
username and password using these settings:

	PROXY_USER = 'yuri'
	PROXY_PASSWORD = 'secret'
