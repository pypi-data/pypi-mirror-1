zope.testing Changelog
**********************

3.7.0 (2008-09-22)
==================

- Added an alterate setuptools / distutils commands for running all tests
  using our testrunner.  See 'zope.testing.testrunner.eggsupport:ftest'.

- Added a setuptools-compatible test loader which skips tests with layers:
  the testrunner used by 'setup.py test' doesn't know about them, and those
  tests then fail.  See 'zope.testing.testrunner.eggsupport:SkipLayers'.

- Added support for Jython, when a garbage collector call is sent.

- Added support to bootstrap on Jython.

- Fixed NameError in StartUpFailure.

- Open doctest files in universal mode, so that packages released in Windoes
  can be tested in Linux, for example.


3.6.0 (2008/07/10)
==================

- Added -j option to parallel tests run in subprocesses.

- RENormalizer accepts plain Python callables.

- Added --slow-test option.

- Added --no-progress and --auto-progress options.

- Complete refactoring of the test runner into multiple code files and a more
  modular (pipeline-like) architecture.

- Unified unit tests with the layer support by introducing a real unit test
  layer.

- Added a doctest for ``zope.testing.module``. There were several bugs
  that were fixed:

  * ``README.txt`` was a really bad default argument for the module
    name, as it is not a proper dotted name. The code would
    immediately fail as it would look for the ``txt`` module in the
    ``README`` package. The default is now ``__main__``.

  * The tearDown function did not clean up the ``__name__`` entry in the
    global dictionary.

- Fix a bug that caused a SubprocessError to be generated if a subprocess
  sent any output to stderr.

- Fix a bug that caused the unit tests to be skipped if run in a subprocess.


3.5.1 (2007/08/14)
==================

Bugs Fixed:
-----------

- Post-mortem debugging wasn't invoked for layer-setup failures.

3.5.0 (2007/07/19)
==================

New Features
------------

- The test runner now works on Python 2.5.

- Added support for cProfile.

- Added output colorizing (-c option).

- Added --hide-secondary-failures and --show-secondary-failures options
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/115454).

Bugs Fixed:
-----------

- Fix some problems with Unicode in doctests.

- Fix "Error reading from subprocess" errors on Unix-like systems.

3.4 (2007/03/29)
================

New Features
------------

- Added exit-with-status support (supports use with buildbot and
  zc.recipe.testing)

- Added a small framework for automating set up and tear down of
  doctest tests. See setupstack.txt.

Bugs Fixed:
-----------

- Fix testrunner-wo-source.txt and testrunner-errors.txt to run with a
  read-only source tree.

3.0 (2006/09/20)
================

- Updated the doctest copy with text-file encoding support.

- Added logging-level support to loggingsuppport module.

- At verbosity-level 1, dots are not output continuously, without any
  line breaks.

- Improved output when the inability to tear down a layer causes tests
  to be run in a subprocess.

- Made zope.exception required only if the zope_tracebacks extra is
  requested.

2.x.y (???)
===========

- Fix the test coverage. If a module, for example `interfaces`, was in an
  ignored directory/package, then if a module of the same name existed in a
  covered directory/package, then it was also ignored there, because the
  ignore cache stored the result by module name and not the filename of the
  module.

2.0 (2006/01/05)
================

- Corresponds to the version of the zope.testing package shipped as part of
  the Zope 3.2.0 release.
