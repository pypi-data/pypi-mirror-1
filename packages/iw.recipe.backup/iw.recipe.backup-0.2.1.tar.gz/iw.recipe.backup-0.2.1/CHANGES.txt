==================

  - xxx [Ingeniweb]

0.2.1 (2008-11-24)
==================

  - added 'base-path' option [fdupre]
    if set, use it instead buildout-dir, really usefull if datas are stored
    in another place in the system (NAS, NFS mount...).

0.2.0 (2008-05-08)
==================

  - added 'archive-before-backup' option. [tdesvenain]
    True by default. If set to 0, buildout is not backuped before a restore

  - added 'include-folders' option, that allows to limit backup
    on some directories [tdesvenain]

  - create backups dir if not exists [tdesvenain]

  - add format option instead of archive-root-name

0.1.1 (2008-03-21)

    It is more a conveniency since everything
    is backed up in any case.
