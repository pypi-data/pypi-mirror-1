Description: lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It
        provides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree
        API.
        
        It extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,
        RelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.

        ==================
        
        Features added
        --------------
        
        Bugs fixed
        ----------
        
        * Ref-count leaks when lxml enters a try-except statement while an
        outside exception lives in sys.exc_*(). This was due to a problem in
        Cython, not lxml itself.
        
        * Parser Unicode decoding errors could get swallowed by other
        exceptions.
        
        * Name/import errors in some Python modules.
        
        * Internal DTD subsets that did not specify a system or public ID were
        not serialised and did not appear in the docinfo property of
        ElementTrees.
        
        * Fix a pre-Py3k warning when parsing from a gzip file in Py2.6.
        
        * Test suite fixes for libxml2 2.7.
        
        * Resolver.resolve_string() did not work for non-ASCII byte strings.
        
        * Resolver.resolve_file() was broken.
        
        * Overriding the parser encoding didn't work for many encodings.
