Description: lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It
        provides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree
        API.
        
        It extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,
        RelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.

        2.2alpha1 (2008-11-23)
        ======================
        
        Features added
        --------------
        
        * Support for XSLT result tree fragments in XPath/XSLT extension
        functions.
        
        * QName objects have new properties ``namespace`` and ``localname``.
        
        * New options for exclusive C14N and C14N without comments.
        
        * Instantiating a custom Element classes creates a new Element.
        
        Bugs fixed
        ----------
        
        * XSLT didn't inherit the parse options of the input document.
        
        * 0-bytes could slip through the API when used inside of Unicode
        strings.
        
        * With ``lxml.html.clean.autolink``, links with balanced parenthesis,
        that end in a parenthesis, will be linked in their entirety (typical
        with Wikipedia links).
