Description: lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It
        provides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree
        API.
        
        It extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,
        RelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.

        2.2.1 (2009-06-02)
        ==================
        
        Features added
        --------------
        
        * Injecting default attributes into a document during XML Schema
        validation (also at parse time).
        
        * Pass ``huge_tree`` parser option to disable parser security
        restrictions imposed by libxml2 2.7.
        
        Bugs fixed
        ----------
        
        * The script for statically building libxml2 and libxslt didn't work
        in Py3.
        
        * ``XMLSchema()`` also passes invalid schema documents on to libxml2
        for parsing (which could lead to a crash before release 2.6.24).
