Description: lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It
        provides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree
        API.
        
        It extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,
        RelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.
        
        In case you want to use the current in-development version of lxml, you can
        get it from the subversion repository at http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk .
        Running ``easy_install lxml==dev`` will install it from
        http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk#egg=lxml-dev
        
        Current bug fixes for the stable version are at
        http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-1.3 .
        Running ``easy_install lxml==1.3bugfix`` will install this
        version from
        http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-1.3#egg=lxml-1.3bugfix
        
        1.3.4 (2007-08-30)
        ==================
        
        Features added
        --------------
        
        * The ``ElementMaker`` in ``lxml.builder`` now accepts the keyword arguments
        ``namespace`` and ``nsmap`` to set a namespace and nsmap for the Elements it
        creates.
        
        * The ``docinfo`` on ElementTree objects has new properties ``internalDTD``
        and ``externalDTD`` that return a DTD object for the internal or external
        subset of the document respectively.
        
        * Serialising an ElementTree now includes any internal DTD subsets that are
        part of the document, as well as comments and PIs that are siblings of the
        root node.
        
        Bugs fixed
        ----------
        
        * Parsing with the ``no_network`` option could fail
        
        Other changes
        -------------
        
        * lxml now raises a TagNameWarning about tag names containing ':' instead of
        an Error as 1.3.3 did.  The reason is that a number of projects currently
        misuse the previous lack of tag name validation to generate namespace
        prefixes without declaring namespaces.  Apart from the danger of generating
        broken XML this way, it also breaks most of the namespace-aware tools in
        XML, including XPath, XSLT and validation.  lxml 1.3.x will continue to
        support this bug with a Warning, while lxml 2.0 will be strict about
        well-formed tag names (not only regarding ':').
        
        * Serialising an Element no longer includes its comment and PI siblings (only
        ElementTree serialisation includes them).
