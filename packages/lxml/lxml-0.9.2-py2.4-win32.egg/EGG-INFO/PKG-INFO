Description: lxml is a Pythonic binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It provides
        safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree API.
        
        It extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,
        RelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.

        ==================
        
        Features added
        --------------
        
        * Speedup for Element.makeelement(): the new element now reuses the original
        libxml2 document instead of creating a new empty one
        
        * Speedup for reversed() iteration over element children (Py2.4+ only)
        
        * ElementTree compatible QName class
        
        * RelaxNG and XMLSchema now accept any Element, not only ElementTrees
        
        Bugs fixed
        ----------
        
        * str(xslt_result) was broken for XSLT output other than UTF-8
        
        * Memory leak if write_c14n fails to write the file after conversion
        
        * Crash in XMLSchema and RelaxNG when passing non-schema documents
        
        * Memory leak in RelaxNG() when RelaxNGParseError is raised
