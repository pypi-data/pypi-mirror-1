Description: lxml is a Pythonic binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It provides
        safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree API.
        
        It extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,
        RelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.

        ==================
        
        Features added
        --------------
        
        * lxml.sax.ElementTreeContentHandler checks closing elements and raises
        SaxError on mismatch
        
        * lxml.sax.ElementTreeContentHandler now supports namespace-less SAX events
        (startElement, endElement) and defaults to empty attributes (keyword
        argument)
        
        * zip_safe flag allows setuptools to install lxml as zipped egg
        
        * Speedup for repeatedly accessing element tag names
        
        * Minor API performance improvements
        
        Bugs fixed
        ----------
        
        * Memory deallocation bug when using XSLT output method "html"
        
        * sax.py was handling UTF-8 encoded tag names where it shouldn't
        
        * lxml.tests package will no longer be installed (is still in source tar)
