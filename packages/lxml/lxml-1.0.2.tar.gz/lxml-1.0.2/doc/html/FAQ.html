<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Is there a tutorial?</p>
<p>There is a <a class="reference" href="http://effbot.org/zone/element.htm">tutorial for ElementTree</a> which also works for lxml.etree.
The <a class="reference" href="api.html">API documentation</a> also contains many examples.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Where can I find more documentation about lxml?</p>
<p>There is a lot of documentation as lxml implements the well-known
<a class="reference" href="http://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm">ElementTree API</a> and tries to follow its documentation as closely as
possible.  There are a couple of issues where lxml cannot keep up
compatibility.  They are described in the <a class="reference" href="compatibility.html">compatibility</a> documentation.
The lxml specific extensions to the API are described by individual files
in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">doc</span></tt> directory of the distribution and on <a class="reference" href="http://codespeak.net/lxml/#documentation">the web page</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">My application crashes! Why does lxml.etree do that?</p>
<p>One of the goals of lxml is &quot;no segfaults&quot;, so if there is no clear warning
in the documentation that you were doing something potentially harmful, you
have found a bug and we would like to hear about it.  Please report this
bug to the mailing list.  See the next section on how to do that.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">I think I have found a bug in lxml. What should I do?</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>First, you should look at the <a class="reference" href="http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk/CHANGES.txt">current developer changelog</a> to see if
this is a known problem that has already been fixed in the SVN trunk.</li>
<li>Otherwise, we would really like to hear about it.  Please report it to
the <a class="reference" href="http://codespeak.net/mailman/listinfo/lxml-dev">mailing list</a> so that we can fix it.  It is very helpful in this
case if you can come up with a short code snippet that demonstrates your
problem.  Please also report the version of lxml, libxml2 and libxslt
that you are using (see the module attributes <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">etree.LXML_VERSION</span></tt>
etc.).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Can I use threads to concurrently access the lxml API?</p>
<p>Short answer: No.</p>
<p>Long answer: lxml does not currently release the GIL (Python's global
interpreter lock) internally, so you will not benefit from any performance
improvements by using threads.  It is also not trivial to free the GIL, as
lxml calls back into Python in many places during XML processing: extension
functions, Python resolvers, error reporting, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Why doesn't the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pretty_print</span></tt> option reformat my XML output?</p>
<p>Pretty printing (or formatting) an XML document means adding white space to
the content.  These modifications are harmless if they only impact elements
in the document that do not carry (text) data.  They corrupt your data if
they impact elements that contain data.  If lxml cannot distinguish between
whitespace and data, it will not alter your data.  Whitespace is therefore
only added between nodes that do not contain data.  This is always the case
for trees constructed element-by-element, so no problems should be expected
here.  For parsed trees, a good way to assure that no conflicting
whitespace is left in the tree is the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">remove_blank_text</span></tt> option:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; parser = etree.XMLParser(remove_blank_text=True)
&gt;&gt;&gt; tree = etree.parse(file, parser)
</pre>
<p>This will allow the parser to drop blank text nodes when constructing the
tree.  If you now call a serialization function to pretty print this tree,
lxml can add fresh whitespace to the XML tree to indent it.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Why can't lxml parse my XML from unicode strings?</p>
<p>lxml can read Python unicode strings and even tries to support them if
libxml2 does not.  However, if the unicode string declares an XML encoding
internally (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;?xml</span> <span class="pre">encoding=&quot;...&quot;?&gt;</span></tt>), parsing is bound to fail, as this
encoding is most likely not the real encoding used in Python unicode.  The
same is true for HTML unicode strings that contain charset meta tags.  Note
that Python uses different encodings for unicode on different platforms, so
even specifying the real internal unicode encoding is not portable between
Python interpreters.  Don't do it.</p>
<p>Python unicode strings with XML data or HTML data that carry encoding
information are broken.  lxml will not parse them.  You must provide
parsable data in a valid encoding.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">How can I find out which namespace prefixes are used in a document?</p>
<p>You can traverse the document (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">getiterator()</span></tt>) and collect the prefix
attributes from all Elements into a set.  However, it is unlikely that you
really want to do that.  You do not need these prefixes, honestly.  You
only need the namespace URIs.  All namespace comparisons use these, so feel
free to make up your own prefixes when you use XPath expressions or
extension functions.</p>
<p>The only place where you might consider specifying prefixes is the
serialization of Elements that were created through the API.  Here, you can
specify a prefix mapping through the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">nsmap</span></tt> argument when creating the
root Element.  Its children will then inherit this prefix for
serialization.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">How can I specify a default namespace for XPath expressions?</p>
<p>You can't.  In XPath, there is no such thing as a default namespace.  Just
use an arbitrary prefix and let the namespace dictionary of the XPath
evaluators map it to your namespace.  See also the question above.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">What are the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">findall()</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">xpath()</span></tt> methods on Element(Tree)?</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">findall()</span></tt> is part of the original <a class="reference" href="http://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm">ElementTree API</a>.  It supports a
<a class="reference" href="http://effbot.org/zone/element-xpath.htm">simple subset of the XPath language</a>, without predicates, conditions and
other advanced features.  It is very handy for finding specific tags in a
tree.  Another important difference is namespace handling, which uses the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">{namespace}tagname</span></tt> notation.  This is not supported by XPath.  The
findall, find and findtext methods are compatible with other ElementTree
implementations and allow writing portable code that runs on ElementTree,
cElementTree and lxml.etree.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">xpath()</span></tt>, on the other hand, supports the complete power of the XPath
language, including predicates, XPath functions and Python extension
functions.  The syntax is defined by the <a class="reference" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath">XPath specification</a>.  If you
need the expressiveness and selectivity of XPath, the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">xpath()</span></tt> method,
the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">XPath</span></tt> class and the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">XPathEvaluator</span></tt> are the best <a class="reference" href="performance.html#xpath">choice</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Why doesn't <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">findall()</span></tt> support full XPath expressions?</p>
<p>It was decided that it is more important to keep compatibility with
<a class="reference" href="http://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm">ElementTree</a> to simplify code migration between the libraries.  The main
difference compared to XPath is the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">{namespace}tagname</span></tt> notation used in
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">findall()</span></tt>, which is not valid XPath.</p>
<p>ElementTree and lxml.etree use the same implementation, which assures 100%
compatibility.  Note that <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">findall()</span></tt> is <a class="reference" href="performance.html#tree-traversal">so fast</a> in lxml that a native
implementation would not bring any performance benefits.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">What is the difference between str(xslt(doc)) and xslt(doc).write() ?</p>
<p>The str() implementation of the XSLTResultTree class (a subclass of
ElementTree) knows about the output method chosen in the stylesheet
(xsl:output), write() doesn't.  If you call write(), the result will be a
normal XML tree serialization in the requested encoding.  Calling this
method may also fail for XSLT results that are not XML trees (e.g. string
results).</p>
<p>If you call str(), it will return the serialized result as specified by the
XSL transform.  This correctly serializes string results to encoded Python
strings and honours <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">xsl:output</span></tt> options like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">indent</span></tt>.  This almost
certainly does what you want, so you should only use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">write()</span></tt> if you are
sure that the XSLT result is an XML tree and you want to override the
encoding and indentation options requested by the stylesheet.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Why is my application so slow?</p>
<p>lxml.etree is a very fast library for processing XML.  There are, however,
<a class="reference" href="performance.html#the-elementtree-api">a few caveats</a> involved in the mapping of the powerful libxml2 library to
the simple and convenient ElementTree API.  Not all operations are as fast
as the simplicity of the API might suggest.  The <a class="reference" href="performance.html">benchmark page</a> has a
comparison to other ElementTree implementations and a number of tips for
performance tweaking.</p>
