Description: lxml is a Pythonic binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It provides
        safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree API.
        
        It extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,
        RelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.
        
        1.1 (2006-09-13)
        ================
        
        Features added
        --------------
        
        * Comments and processing instructions return '<!-- coment -->' and
        '<?pi-target content?>' for repr()
        
        * Parsers are now the preferred (and default) place where element class lookup
        schemes should be registered.  Namespace lookup is no longer supported by
        default.
        
        Bugs fixed
        ----------
        
        * filenames with local 8-bit encoding were not supported
        
        * 1.1beta did not compile under Python 2.3
        
        * ignore unknown 'pyval' attribute values in objectify
        
        * objectify.ObjectifiedElement.addattr() failed to accept Elements and Lists
        
        * objectify.ObjectPath.setattr() failed to accept Elements and Lists
