Description: lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It
        provides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree
        API.
        
        It extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,
        RelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.

        Running ``easy_install lxml==dev`` will install it from

        2.0alpha2 (2007-09-15)
        ======================
        
        Features added
        --------------
        
        * ``ET.write()``, ``tostring()`` and ``tounicode()`` now accept a keyword
        argument ``method`` that can be one of 'xml' (or None), 'html' or 'text' to
        serialise as XML, HTML or plain text content.
        
        * ``iterfind()`` method on Elements returns an iterator equivalent to
        ``findall()``
        
        * ``itertext()`` method on Elements
        
        * Setting a QName object as value of the .text property or as an attribute
        will resolve its prefix in the respective context
        
        * ElementTree-like parser target interface as described in
        http://effbot.org/elementtree/elementtree-xmlparser.htm
        
        * ElementTree-like feed parser interface on XMLParser and HTMLParser
        (``feed()`` and ``close()`` methods)
        
        Bugs fixed
        ----------
        
        * lxml failed to serialise namespace declarations of elements other than the
        root node of a tree
        
        * Race condition in XSLT where the resolver context leaked between concurrent
        XSLT calls
        
        Other changes
        -------------
        
        * ``element.getiterator()`` returns a list, use ``element.iter()`` to retrieve
        an iterator (ElementTree 1.3 compatible behaviour)
