It's also possible to check out the latest development version of lxml
from svn directly, using a command like this::

  svn co http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk lxml

You can also `browse it through the web`_.  Please read `how to build lxml
from source`_ first.  The `latest CHANGES`_ of the developer version are also
accessible.  You can check there if a bug you found has been fixed or a
feature you want has been implemented in the latest trunk version.

Documentation
-------------

lxml follows the ElementTree_ API as much as possible, building it on top of
the native libxml2 tree.  See also the `ElementTree compatibility overview`_
and the `benchmark results`_ comparing lxml to the original ElementTree_ and
cElementTree_ implementations.

lxml also `extends this API`_ to expose libxml2 and libxslt specific
functionality, such as XPath_, `Relax NG`_, `XML Schema`_, `XSLT`_, and
`c14n`_. Python code can be called from XPath expressions and XSLT stylesheets
through the use of `extension functions`_.

In addition to the ElementTree API, lxml also features an API for
`implementing namespaces`_ using tag specific element classes.  This is a
simple way to write arbitrary XML driven APIs on top of lxml.

lxml also offers a `SAX compliant API`_, that works with the SAX support
in the standard library.
