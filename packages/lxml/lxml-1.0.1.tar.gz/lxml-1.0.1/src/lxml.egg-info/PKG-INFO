Description: lxml is a Pythonic binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It provides
        safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree API.
        
        It extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,
        RelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.

        ----------
        
        * Document deallocation could crash in certain garbage collection scenarios
        
        * Extension function calls in XSLT variable declarations could break the
        stylesheet and crash on repeated calls
        
        * Deep copying Elements could loose namespaces declared in parents
        
        * Deep copying Elements did not copy tail
        
        * Parsing file(-like) objects failed to load external entities
        
        * Parsing 8-bit strings from file(-like) objects raised an exception
        
        * xsl:include failed when the stylesheet was parsed from a file-like object
        
        * lxml.sax.ElementTreeProducer did not call startDocument() / endDocument()
        
        * MSVC compiler complained about long strings (supports only 2048 bytes)
