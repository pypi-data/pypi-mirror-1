Description: lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It
        provides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree
        API.
        
        It extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,
        RelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.

        ==================
        
        Bugs fixed
        ----------
        
        * Backported decref crash fix from 2.0
        
        * Well hidden free-while-in-use crash bug in ObjectPath
        
        Other changes
        -------------
        
        * The test suites now run ``gc.collect()`` in the ``tearDown()``
        methods.  While this makes them take a lot longer to run, it also
        makes it easier to link a specific test to garbage collection
        problems that would otherwise appear in later tests.
