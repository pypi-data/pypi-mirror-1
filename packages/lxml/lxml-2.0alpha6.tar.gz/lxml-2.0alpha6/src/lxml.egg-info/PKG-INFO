Description: lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It
        provides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree
        API.
        
        It extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,
        RelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.

        2.0alpha6 (2007-12-19)
        ======================
        
        Features added
        --------------
        
        * New properties ``position`` and ``code`` on ParseError exception (as
        in ET 1.3)
        
        Bugs fixed
        ----------
        
        * Memory leak in the ``parse()`` function.
        
        * Minor bugs in XSLT error message formatting.
        
        * Result document memory leak in target parser.
        
        Other changes
        -------------
        
        * Various places in the XPath, XSLT and iteration APIs now require
        keyword-only arguments.
        
        * The argument order in ``element.itersiblings()`` was changed to
        match the order used in all other iteration methods.  The second
        argument ('preceding') is now a keyword-only argument.
        
        * The ``getiterator()`` method on Elements and ElementTrees was
        reverted to return an iterator as it did in lxml 1.x.  The ET API
        specification allows it to return either a sequence or an iterator,
        and it traditionally returned a sequence in ET and an iterator in
        lxml.  However, it is now deprecated in favour of the ``iter()``
        method, which should be used in new code wherever possible.
        
        * The 'pretty printed' serialisation of ElementTree objects now
        inserts newlines at the root level between processing instructions,
        comments and the root tag.
        
        * A 'pretty printed' serialisation is now terminated with a newline.
        
        * Second argument to ``lxml.etree.Extension()`` helper is no longer
        required, third argument is now a keyword-only argument ``ns``.
        
        * ``lxml.html.tostring`` takes an ``encoding`` argument.
