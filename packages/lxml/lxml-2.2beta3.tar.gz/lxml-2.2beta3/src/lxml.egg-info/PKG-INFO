Description: lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It
        provides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree
        API.
        
        It extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,
        RelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.

        that require escaping.
        
        Bugs fixed
        ----------
        
        * Memory leak in XPath evaluators.
        
        * Crash when parsing indented XML in one thread and merging it with
        other documents parsed in another thread.
        
        * Setting the ``base`` attribute in ``lxml.objectify`` from a unicode
        string failed.

        Other changes
        -------------
        
        * The global error log (which is copied into the exception log) is now
        local to a thread, which fixes some race conditions.
        
        * More robust error handling on serialisation.
