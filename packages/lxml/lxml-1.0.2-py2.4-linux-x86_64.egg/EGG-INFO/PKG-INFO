Description: lxml is a Pythonic binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It provides
        safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree API.
        
        It extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,
        RelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.
        
        1.0.2 (2006-06-27)
        ==================
        
        Features added
        --------------
        
        * Support for setting a custom default Element class as opposed to namespace
        specific classes (which still override the default class)
        
        Bugs fixed
        ----------
        
        * Rare exceptions in Python list functions were not handled
        
        * Parsing accepted unicode strings with XML encoding declaration in certain
        cases
        
        * Parsing 8-bit encoded strings from StringIO objects raised an exception
        
        * Module function ``initThread()`` was removed - useless (and never worked)
        
        * XSLT and parser exception messages include the error line number
