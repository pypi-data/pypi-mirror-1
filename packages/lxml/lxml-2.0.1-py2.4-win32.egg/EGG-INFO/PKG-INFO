Description: lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It
        provides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree
        API.
        
        It extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,
        RelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.

        In case you want to use the current in-development version of lxml, you can
        get it from the subversion repository at http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk .
        Running ``easy_install lxml==dev`` will install it from
        http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk#egg=lxml-dev
        
        
        After an official release of a new stable series, current bug fixes become
        available at http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-2.0 .
        Running ``easy_install lxml==2.0bugfix`` will install this
        version from

        2.0.1 (2008-02-13)
        ==================
        
        Features added
        --------------
        
        * Child iteration in ``lxml.pyclasslookup``.
        
        * Loads of new docstrings reflect the signature of functions and
        methods to make them visible in API docs and ``help()``
        
        Bugs fixed
        ----------
        
        * The module ``lxml.html.builder`` was duplicated as
        ``lxml.htmlbuilder``
        
        * Form elements would return None for ``form.fields.keys()`` if there
        was an unnamed input field.  Now unnamed input fields are completely
        ignored.
        
        * Setting an element slice in objectify could insert slice-overlapping
        elements at the wrong position.
        
        Other changes
        -------------
        
        * The generated API documentation was cleaned up and disburdened from
        non-public classes etc.
        
        * The previously public module ``lxml.html.setmixin`` was renamed to
        ``lxml.html._setmixin`` as it is not an official part of lxml.  If
        you want to use it, feel free to copy it over to your own source
        base.
        
        * Passing ``--with-xslt-config=/path/to/xslt-config`` to setup.py will
        override the ``xslt-config`` script that is used to determine the C
        compiler options.
