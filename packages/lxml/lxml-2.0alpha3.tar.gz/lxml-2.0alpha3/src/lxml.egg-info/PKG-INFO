Description: lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It
        provides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree
        API.
        
        It extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,
        RelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.

        2.0alpha3 (2007-09-26)
        ======================
        
        Features added
        --------------
        
        * Separate ``feed_error_log`` property for the feed parser interface.
        The normal parser interface and ``iterparse`` continue to use
        ``error_log``.
        
        * The normal parsers and the feed parser interface are now separated
        and can be used concurrently on the same parser instance.
        
        * ``fromstringlist()`` and ``tostringlist()`` functions as in
        ElementTree 1.3
        
        * ``iterparse()`` accepts an ``html`` boolean keyword argument for
        parsing with the HTML parser (note that this interface may be
        subject to change)
        
        * Parsers accept an ``encoding`` keyword argument that overrides the encoding
        of the parsed documents.
        
        * New C-API function ``hasChild()`` to test for children
        
        * ``annotate()`` function in objectify can annotate with Python types and XSI
        types in one step.  Accompanied by ``xsiannotate()`` and ``pyannotate()``.
        
        Bugs fixed
        ----------
        
        * XML feed parser setup problem
        
        * Type annotation for unicode strings in ``DataElement()``
        
        Other changes
        -------------
        
        * lxml.etree now emits a warning if you use XPath with libxml2 2.6.27
        (which can crash on certain XPath errors)
        
        * Type annotation in objectify now preserves the already annotated type be
        default to prevent loosing type information that is already there.
