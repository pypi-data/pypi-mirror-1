Description: lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It
        provides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree
        API.
        
        It extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,
        RelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.

        Features added
        --------------
        
        Bugs fixed
        ----------
        
        * AttributeError in feed parser on parse errors
        
        Other changes
        -------------
        
        * Tag name validation in lxml.etree (and lxml.html) now distinguishes
        between HTML tags and XML tags based on the parser that was used to
        parse or create them.  HTML tags no longer reject any non-ASCII
        characters in tag names but only spaces and the special characters
        ``<>&/"'``.
