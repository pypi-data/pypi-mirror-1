Description: lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It
        provides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree
        API.
        
        It extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,
        RelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.

        2.0beta2 (2008-01-25)
        =====================
        
        Features added
        --------------
        
        * Plain ASCII XPath string results are no longer forced into unicode
        objects as in 2.0beta1, but are returned as plain strings as before.
        
        * All XPath string results are 'smart' objects that have a
        ``getparent()`` method to retrieve their parent Element.
        
        * ``with_tail`` option in serialiser functions.
        
        * More accurate exception messages in validator creation.
        
        Bugs fixed
        ----------
        
        * Missing import in ``lxml.html.clean``.
        
        * Some Python 2.4-isms prevented lxml from building/running under
        Python 2.3.
        
        Other changes
        -------------
        
        * Exceptions carry only the part of the error log that is related to
        the operation that caused the error.
        
        * ``XMLSchema()`` and ``RelaxNG()`` now enforce passing the source
        file/filename through the ``file`` keyyword argument.
        
        * The test suite now skips most doctests under Python 2.3.
        
        * ``make clean`` no longer removes the .c files (use ``make
        realclean`` instead)
