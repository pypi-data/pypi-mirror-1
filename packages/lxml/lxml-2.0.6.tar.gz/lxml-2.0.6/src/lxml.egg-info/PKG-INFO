Description: lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It
        provides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree
        API.
        
        It extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,
        RelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.
