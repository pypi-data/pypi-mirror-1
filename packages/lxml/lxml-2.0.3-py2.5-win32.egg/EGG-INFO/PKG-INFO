Description: lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It
        provides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree
        API.
        
        It extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,
        RelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.

        After an official release of a new stable series, current bug fixes become
        available at http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-2.0 .
        Running ``easy_install lxml==2.0bugfix`` will install this

        2.0.3 (2008-03-26)
        ==================
        
        Features added
        --------------
        
        * soupparser.parse() allows passing keyword arguments on to
        BeautifulSoup.
        
        * ``fromstring()`` method in ``lxml.html.soupparser``.
        
        Bugs fixed
        ----------
        
        * ``lxml.html.diff`` didn't treat empty tags properly (e.g.,
        ``<br>``).
        
        * Handle entity replacements correctly in target parser.
        
        * Crash when using ``iterparse()`` with XML Schema validation.
        
        * The BeautifulSoup parser (soupparser.py) did not replace entities,
        which made them turn up in text content.
        
        * Attribute assignment of custom PyTypes in objectify could fail to
        correctly serialise the value to a string.
        
        Other changes
        -------------
        
        * ``lxml.html.ElementSoup`` was replaced by a new module
        ``lxml.html.soupparser`` with a more consistent API.  The old module
        remains for compatibility with ElementTree's own ElementSoup module.
        
        * Setting the XSLT_CONFIG and XML2_CONFIG environment variables at
        build time will let setup.py pick up the ``xml2-config`` and
        ``xslt-config`` scripts from the supplied path name.
        
        * Passing ``--with-xml2-config=/path/to/xml2-config`` to setup.py will
        override the ``xml2-config`` script that is used to determine the C
        compiler options.  The same applies for the ``--with-xslt-config``
        option.
