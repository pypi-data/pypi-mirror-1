Description: lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It
        provides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree
        API.
        
        It extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,
        RelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.
        
        In case you want to use the current in-development version of lxml, you can
        get it from the subversion repository at http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk .
        Running ``easy_install lxml==dev`` will install it from
        http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk#egg=lxml-dev
        
        Current bug fixes for the stable version are at
        http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-1.3 .

        ==================
        
        Features added
        --------------
        
        * ElementTree compatible parser ``ETCompatXMLParser`` strips processing
        instructions and comments while parsing XML
        
        * Parsers now support stripping PIs (keyword argument 'remove_pis')
        
        * ``etree.fromstring()`` now supports parsing both HTML and XML, depending on
        the parser you pass.
        
        * Support ``base_url`` keyword argument in ``HTML()`` and ``XML()``
        
        Bugs fixed
        ----------
        
        * Parsing from Python Unicode strings failed on some platforms
        
        * ``Element()`` did not raise an exception on tag names containing ':'
        
        * ``Element.getiterator(tag)`` did not accept ``Comment`` and
        ``ProcessingInstruction`` as tags. It also accepts ``Element`` now.
