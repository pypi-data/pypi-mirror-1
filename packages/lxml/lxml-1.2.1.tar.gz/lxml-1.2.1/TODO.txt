lxml
====

Exposing libxml2 functionalities
--------------------------------

* Test XML entities, also in an ElementTree context.


In general
----------

* test namespaces more in-depth

* will namespace nodes of unknown namespaces be added (and never freed?)

* more testing on multi-threading

* the code on extension functions and XSLT needs some refactoring


ElementTree
-----------

* _setroot(), even though this is not strictly a public method.


QName
-----

* expose prefix support?


Objectify
---------

* set special __attributes__ on ObjectifiedElement's as Python attributes, not
  XML children


Features
--------

* Relaxed NG compact notation (rnc versus rng) support.  Currently not
  supported by libxml2 (patch exists)

* setting a DTD for validation (maybe a ``DTD`` class like RelaxNG?)
