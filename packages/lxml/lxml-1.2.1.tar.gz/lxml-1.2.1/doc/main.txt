Download
--------

The best way to download binary versions is to visit `lxml at the Python
cheeseshop`_.  It has the source, eggs and installers for various platforms.
The source distribution is signed with `this key`_.

It's also possible to check out the latest development version of lxml
from svn directly, using a command like this::

  svn co http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk lxml

You can also `browse it through the web`_.  Please read `how to build lxml
from source`_ first.  The `latest CHANGES`_ of the developer version are also
accessible.  You can check there if a bug you found has been fixed or a
feature you want has been implemented in the latest trunk version.

Documentation
-------------

lxml.etree follows the ElementTree_ API as much as possible, building it on
top of the native libxml2 tree.  See also the `ElementTree compatibility
overview`_ and the `benchmark results`_ comparing lxml to the original
ElementTree_ and cElementTree_ implementations.

Right after the ElementTree_ documentation, the most important place to look
is the `lxml.etree API documentation`_.  It describes how lxml extends the
ElementTree API to expose libxml2 and libxslt specific functionality, such as
XPath_, `Relax NG`_, `XML Schema`_, `XSLT`_, and `c14n`_.  Python code can be
called from XPath expressions and XSLT stylesheets through the use of
`extension functions`_.  lxml also offers a `SAX compliant API`_, that works
with the SAX support in the standard library.

There is a separate module `lxml.objectify`_ that implements a data-binding
API on top of lxml.etree.  See the `objectify and etree`_ FAQ entry for a
comparison.

In addition to the ElementTree API, lxml also features a sophisticated API for
`custom element classes`_.  This is a simple way to write arbitrary XML driven
APIs on top of lxml.  As of version 1.1, lxml.etree has a new `C-level API`_
that can be used to efficiently extend lxml.etree in external C modules,
including custom element class support.
