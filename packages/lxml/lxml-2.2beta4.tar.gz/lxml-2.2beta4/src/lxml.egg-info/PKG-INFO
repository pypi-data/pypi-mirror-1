Description: lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It
        provides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree
        API.
        
        It extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,
        RelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.

        2.2beta4 (2009-02-27)
        =====================
        
        Features added
        --------------
        
        * Support strings and instantiable Element classes as child arguments
        to the constructor of custom Element classes.
        
        * GZip compression support for serialisation to files and file-like
        objects.
        
        Bugs fixed
        ----------
        
        * Deep-copying an ElementTree copied neither its sibling PIs and
        comments nor its internal/external DTD subsets.
        
        * Soupparser failed on broken attributes without values.
        
        * Crash in XSLT when overwriting an already defined attribute using
        ``xsl:attribute``.
        
        * Crash bug in exception handling code under Python 3.  This was due
        to a problem in Cython, not lxml itself.
        
        * ``lxml.html.FormElement._name()`` failed for non top-level forms.
        
        * ``TAG`` special attribute in constructor of custom Element classes
        was evaluated incorrectly.
        
        Other changes
        -------------
        
        * Official support for Python 3.0.1.
        
        * ``Element.findtext()`` now returns an empty string instead of None
        for Elements without text content.
