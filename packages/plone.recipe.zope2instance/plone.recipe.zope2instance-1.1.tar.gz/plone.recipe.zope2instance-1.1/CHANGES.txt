Change History
==============

1.1
---

- Small documentation update. Added link to the bugtracker.
  [hannosch]

- Changed default of zope.conf option 'default-zpublisher-encoding' to 'utf-8'
  instead of Zope's default value of 'iso-8859-15'.

- Have PID file's location default to '${buildout:directory}/var/${name}.pid'.
  Keeping the PID file in $INSTANCE_HOME gives trouble when buildout rebuilds
  the part.
  [nouri, mustapha]

1.0
---

- Increased 'zodb_cache_size' default value to 5000, which is more likely a
  better default these days.
  [hannosch]

- Added support for 'extra-paths' as in 'zc.recipe.egg'; this is useful when
  using regular python packages for which no eggs are available (yet), i.e.
  with 'plone.recipe.distros'.
  [witsch]

- Added zeo-storage option (merge branch ree-add-zeo-storage-option).
  [ree]

- Avoid doubled entries to eggs specified in the buildout in 'sys.path':
  the working set ('ws') gets passed again when installing the script
  ('bin/instance'), but it is not also added to 'extra_paths'.
  [witsch]

- Patching 'PYTHONPATH' in the Zope startup skripts should insert all
  additional paths (to eggs) __before__ 'SOFTWARE_HOME', because otherwise
  (newer) egg versions of components from the standard Zope distribution
  (i.e. stuff that lives in 'lib/python') cannot be used.
  [witsch]

- Changed the option to suppress deprecation warnings to "--nowarn" or
  '--nowarning" to be consistent with "zopectl test".
  [witsch]

- Added option "-w" to allow the test runner to suppress deprecation warnings,
  so it's easier to spot failing tests...
  [witsch]

- Updated import for Zope 2.7 (and below) compatibility.
  [duffyd]

- Merging -r51966:52659 claytron-zopeconfoptions branch to trunk.
  [claytron]

- Made the config snippet prettier while still getting the resulting
  indentation right.
  [witsch]

0.9
---

- Added support for zodb 3.8's "<blobstorage>" directive.
  [witsch]

- Added a script name arg before callint zope.testing.testrunner.run.
  zope.testing.testrunner:1772, get_options removes the first arg from
  the list of arguments expecting a script name there. Was causing
  "bin/instance test" to behave improperly.
  [rossp]

0.8
---

- Use bin if present falling back to utilities. This makes it possible to use
  a Zope version installed from a tarball and not compiled inplace.
  [rossp]

0.7
---

- Found the problem with strange environment variables.
  [hannosch]

- Fixed documentation bug, the cache size is respected by non-zeo instance as
  well.
  [hannosch]

0.6
---

- J1m actually read the docs ;)
  [hannosch]

- Attempt to fix the sometimes insane number of tests which are found by the
  test runner.
  [hannosch]

0.5
---

- Added an option to set the effective-user.
  [optilude]

0.4
---

- Generate a bin/repozo script to perform backups using repozo.py (and
  set up the appropriate pythonpath for this to work).
  [optilude]

- Document options properly, and add the ability to specify a zope.conf
  file explicitly rather than having one generated from a template.
  [optilude]

0.3
---

- Finally found a way to provide the Zope Windows service with the right
  environment. We need a new wrapper script, which sets up the PYTHONPATH.
  [hannosch]

- Make it possible to configure the name of the zopectl script using the
  control-script option in the [instance] section.
  [wichert]

0.2
---

- Extend support for zcml slugs to include Zope 2.9.
  [dunny]

- Added support for making a ZEO-client.
  [regebro]

0.1
---

- Initial implementation.
  [hannosch]
