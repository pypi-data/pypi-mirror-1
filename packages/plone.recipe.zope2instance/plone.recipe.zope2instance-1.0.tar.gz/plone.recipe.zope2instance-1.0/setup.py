    long_description="""\
This recipe creates and configures a Zope 2 instance in parts. It also
installs a control script, which is like zopectl, in the bin/ directory.
The name of the control script is the the name of the part in buildout.

You can use it with a part like this::
  
  [instance]
  recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
  zope2-location = /path/to/zope2/install
  user = admin:admin
  http-address = 8080
  eggs = ${buildout:eggs} my.package
  products = ${buildout:directory}/products
  zcml = my.package

The available options are:

zope2-location
  The path where Zope 2 is installed. If you are also
  using the plone.recipe.zope2install recipe, and you have that configured
  as a part called 'zope2' prior to the zope2instance part, you can use
  ${zope2:location} for this parameter.

zope-conf
  A relative or absolute path to a zope.conf file. If this is
  not given, a zope.conf will be generated based on the the options below.

repozo
  The path to the repozo.py backup script. A wrapper for this will be
  generated in bin/repozo, which sets up the appropriate environment for
  running this. Defaults to "${zope2-location}/utilities/ZODBTools/repozo.py".
  Set this to an empty value if you do not want this script to be generated.

The following options all affect the generated zope.conf.

products
  A list of paths where Zope 2 products are installed. The first
  path takes precedence in case the same product is found in more than one
  directory.

zcml
  Install ZCML slugs for the packages listed, separated by whitespace.

extra-paths
  A list of paths where additional python packages are installed.  The paths
  are searched in the given order after all egg and products paths.

default-zpublisher-encoding
  This controls what character set is used to encode unicode data that reaches
  ZPublisher without any other specified encoding. Zope defaults to iso-8859-15

debug-mode
  Set to 'on' to turn on debug mode in Zope. Defaults to 'off'.

verbose-security
  Set to 'on' to turn on verbose security (and switch to
  the Python security implementation). Defaults to 'off' (and the C security
  implementation).

effective-user
  The name of the effective user for the Zope process. Defaults to not setting
  an effective user.

ip-address
  The default IP address on which Zope's various server protocol
  implementations will listen for requests. If this is unset, Zope will listen
  on all IP addresses supported by the machine. This directive can be
  overridden on a per-server basis in the servers section. Defaults to not
  setting an ip-address.

port-base
  Offset applied to the port numbers used for ZServer configurations. For
  example, if the http-server port is 8080 and the port-base is 1000, the HTTP
  server will listen on port 9080. This makes it easy to change the complete
  set of ports used by a Zope server process. Zope defaults to 0.

http-address
  Give a port for the HTTP server. Defaults to 8080.

event-log
  The filename of the event log. Defaults to
  var/log/${partname}.log
  
event-log-level
  Set the level of the console output for the event log. Level may be any of
  CRITICAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, or ALL. Defaults to INFO

z2-log
  The filename for the Z2 access log. Defaults to
  var/log/${partname}-Z2.log.

z2-log-level
  Set the log level for the access log. Level may be any of CRITICAL, ERROR,
  WARN, INFO, DEBUG, or ALL. Defaults to WARN

file-storage
  The filename where the ZODB data file will be stored.
  Defaults to var/filestorage/Data.fs.

blob-storage
  The name of the directory where the ZODB blob data will be stored.

zeo-client
  Set to 'on' to make this instance a ZEO client. In this case,
  setting the zeo-address option is required, and the file-storage option has
  no effect. To set up a ZEO server, you can use the
  plone.recipe.zope2zeoserver recipe. Defaults to 'off'.

zeo-address
  Set the address of the ZEO server. Defaults to 8100.

zodb-cache-size
  Set the ZODB cache size, i.e. the number of objects which
  the ZODB cache will try to hold. Defaults to 5000.

zeo-client-cache-size
  Set the size of the ZEO client cache. Defaults to '30MB'.

zeo-storage
  Set the name of the ZEO storage. Defaults to '1'.

zserver-threads
  Specify the number of threads that Zope's ZServer web server will use to
  service requests. You shouldn't change this unless you know what you are
  doing. Zope's default is 4.

zope-conf-additional
  Give additional lines to zope.conf. Make sure you
  indent any lines aftter the one with the parameter.
