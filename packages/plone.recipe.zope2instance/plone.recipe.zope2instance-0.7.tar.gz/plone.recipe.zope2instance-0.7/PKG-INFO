Description: This recipe creates and configures a Zope 2 instance in parts. It also
        installs a control script, which is like zopectl, in the bin/ directory.
        The name of the control script is the the name of the part in buildout.
        
        You can use it with a part like this::
        
        [instance]
        recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
        zope2-location = /path/to/zope2/install
        user = admin:admin
        http-address = 8080
        eggs = ${buildout:eggs} my.package
        products = ${buildout:directory}/products
        zcml = my.package
        
        The available options are:
        
        zope2-location
        The path where Zope 2 is installed. If you are also
        using the plone.recipe.zope2install recipe, and you have that configured
        as a part called 'zope2' prior to the zope2instance part, you can use
        ${zope2:location} for this parameter.
        
        zope-conf
        A relative or absolute path to a zope.conf file. If this is
        not given, a zope.conf will be generated based on the the options below.
        
        repozo
        The path to the repozo.py backup script. A wrapper for this will be
        generated in bin/repozo, which sets up the appropriate environment for
        running this. Defaults to "${zope2-location}/utilities/ZODBTools/repozo.py".
        Set this to an empty value if you do not want this script to be generated.
        
        The following options all affect the generated zope.conf.
        
        products
        A list of paths where Zope 2 products are installed. The first
        path takes precedence in case the same product is found in more than one
        directory.
        
        zcml
        Install ZCML slugs for the packages listed, separated by whitespace.
        
        debug-mode
        Set to 'on' to turn on debug mode in Zope. Defaults to 'off'.
        
        verbose-security
        Set to 'on' to turn on verbose security (and switch to
        the Python security implementation). Defaults to 'off' (and the C security
        implementation).
        
        effective-user
        The name of the effective user for the Zope process. Defaults to not setting
        an effective user.
        
        http-address
        Give a port for the HTTP server. Defaults to 8080.
        
        event-log
        The filename of the event log. Defaults to
        var/log/${partname}.log
        
        z2-log
        The filename for the Z2 access log. Defaults to
        var/log/${partname}-Z2.log.
        
        file-storage
        The filename where the ZODB data file will be stored.
        Defaults to var/filestorage/Data.fs.
        
        zeo-client
        Set to 'on' to make this instance a ZEO client. In this case,
        setting the zeo-address option is required, and the file-storage option has
        no effect. To set up a ZEO server, you can use the
        plone.recipe.zope2zeoserver recipe. Defaults to 'off'.
        
        zeo-address
        Set the address of the ZEO server. Defaults to 8100.
        
        zodb-cache-size
        Set the ZODB cache size, i.e. the number of objects which
        the ZODB cache will try to hold. Defaults to 2000.
        
        zeo-client-cache-size
        Set the size of the ZEO client cache. Defaults to '30MB'.
        
        zope-conf-additional
        Give additional lines to zope.conf. Make sure you
        indent any lines aftter the one with the parameter.
