Change History
==============

2.0 (2008-05-29)
----------------
- Do not use system but exec when starting Zope using `console`. This makes it
  possible for process management tools to properly manage Zope processes.
  [wichert]

- Added `site-zcml` option
  Added tests
  [mustapha]

- Add support for ZEO authentication. Note that this does not work with any
  released Zope or ZODB version at this moment. See
  http://mail.zope.org/pipermail/zope/2005-October/161951.html for required
  patches.
  [wichert]

- Added FTP and WebDAV options
  [claytron]

- Allow rel-storage to be an empty string, meaning 'do not use relstorage'.
  This allows an extending buildout configuration to disable relstorage again.
  [mj]

1.9 (2008-04-15)
----------------

- Fix rel-storage parsing for options with spaces. Note that split() or
  split(None) already strips the string.
  [mj]

1.8 (2008-04-05)
----------------

- Fixed a Win32 problem in which the presence of Python string escapes in the
  path to zope.conf (e.g., d:\botest\parts\instance\etc\zope.conf would escape
  the \b). This showed up when using the 'run', 'debug' or 'adduser' commands.
  This fixes #211416.
  [smcmahon]

- Added `console` command to the instance script, which is equivalent to fg but
  does not implicitly turn on debug mode but respects the zope.conf setting.
  [hannosch]

1.7 (2008-03-31)
----------------

- Added new client-home option and let it default to a subfolder of the
  buildout-wide var folder with a subfolder of the name of the section.
  [hannosch]

- Added limited support for running tests under Zope <= 2.8.
  [hannosch]

1.6 (2008-03-27)
----------------

- Fixed runzope script generation for Zope 2.8.
  [hannosch]

- Cleaned up "./bin/instance test" option handling.
  [stefan]

- Removed generator expressions as these aren't supported in < py2.4, which is
  used by zope 2.7/8.
  [duffyd]

1.5 (2008-02-29)
----------------

- Added `access-log-custom` option to be able to use another event logger
  than the file one for the access logger.
  [tarek]

- Fix instance generation to work on Windows with blanks in the path name.
  This closes #188023.
  [hannosch, gotti]

- Added 'zeo-client-client' option which results in 'client <value>' inside
  <zeoclient>.
  [timte, hannosch]
  
- Made relstorage handling more generic, so it now supports any RelStorage 
  adapter, including Oracle (which was broken).
  [mj]

1.4 (2008-02-23)
----------------

- Fix typo in event log parameter name (from "z-log" to "z2-log"), to comply
  with the documentation. This closes #190943.
  [kdeldycke]

- Create pid and lock file folders if they don't exist.
  [kdeldycke]

- Remove hard-coded log level and use the event_log_level parameter to set it
  dynamically. This closes #190994.
  [kdeldycke]

- Added a test environment, using zc.buildout.testing, and a doctest that
  tries the recipe.
  [tarek]

- Added an `event-log-custom` option
  [tarek]

- Added example for the zope-conf-additional option. This closes #185539.
  [klm, hannosch]

- Added `rel-storage` option to be able to wire Zope to RelStorage
  (postgresql/oracle) instead of a FileStorage database.
  [tarek]

1.3
---

- For each entry in recipe-specified 'extra-paths' line, add a 'path' line
  to the instance and Zope client zope.conf files.
  [klm]

1.2
---

- Added the boolean `shared-blob` option, defaulting to `no`. If all of
  `zeo-client`, `blob-storage` and `shared-blob` options are set,
  the instance will assume the blob directory set by `blob-storage` is shared
  with the server instead of streaming 'blob' files through the ZEO connection.
  [rochael]

- Changed `ctl.do_foreground()` (which is invoked by the `fg` command
  line argument) start Zope in debug mode to emulate the behavior of
  `zopectl fg`. This required a little special WIN32 code to make
  sure it would work in both `*nix` and Windows.
  [smcmahon]

- Added `var` option, which is used to configure the base directory for all
  the things going into var.
  [hannosch]

- Added `zeo-var` option, which is used in the zeo storage snippets to
  configure the zeo var folder.
  [hannosch]

- Merged rochael-blobsupport branch. Added support for ZODB 3.8 blob storage
  configuration for ZEO clients. This references
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/collective.buildout/+bug/179113.
  [rochael, hannosch]

- Added `zeo-client-name` option. Defaults to the name of the ZEO client.
  [hannosch]

1.1
---

- Small documentation update. Added link to the bugtracker.
  [hannosch]

- Changed default of zope.conf option 'default-zpublisher-encoding' to 'utf-8'
  instead of Zope's default value of 'iso-8859-15'.

- Have PID file's location default to '${buildout:directory}/var/${name}.pid'.
  Keeping the PID file in $INSTANCE_HOME gives trouble when buildout rebuilds
  the part.
  [nouri, mustapha]

1.0
---

- Increased 'zodb_cache_size' default value to 5000, which is more likely a
  better default these days.
  [hannosch]

- Added support for 'extra-paths' as in 'zc.recipe.egg'; this is useful when
  using regular python packages for which no eggs are available (yet), i.e.
  with 'plone.recipe.distros'.
  [witsch]

- Added zeo-storage option (merge branch ree-add-zeo-storage-option).
  [ree]

- Avoid doubled entries to eggs specified in the buildout in 'sys.path':
  the working set ('ws') gets passed again when installing the script
  ('bin/instance'), but it is not also added to 'extra_paths'.
  [witsch]

- Patching 'PYTHONPATH' in the Zope startup skripts should insert all
  additional paths (to eggs) __before__ 'SOFTWARE_HOME', because otherwise
  (newer) egg versions of components from the standard Zope distribution
  (i.e. stuff that lives in 'lib/python') cannot be used.
  [witsch]

- Changed the option to suppress deprecation warnings to "--nowarn" or
  '--nowarning" to be consistent with "zopectl test".
  [witsch]

- Added option "-w" to allow the test runner to suppress deprecation warnings,
  so it's easier to spot failing tests...
  [witsch]

- Updated import for Zope 2.7 (and below) compatibility.
  [duffyd]

- Merging -r51966:52659 claytron-zopeconfoptions branch to trunk.
  [claytron]

- Made the config snippet prettier while still getting the resulting
  indentation right.
  [witsch]

0.9
---

- Added support for zodb 3.8's "<blobstorage>" directive.
  [witsch]

- Added a script name arg before callint zope.testing.testrunner.run.
  zope.testing.testrunner:1772, get_options removes the first arg from
  the list of arguments expecting a script name there. Was causing
  "bin/instance test" to behave improperly.
  [rossp]

0.8
---

- Use bin if present falling back to utilities. This makes it possible to use
  a Zope version installed from a tarball and not compiled inplace.
  [rossp]

0.7
---

- Found the problem with strange environment variables.
  [hannosch]

- Fixed documentation bug, the cache size is respected by non-zeo instance as
  well.
  [hannosch]

0.6
---

- J1m actually read the docs ;)
  [hannosch]

- Attempt to fix the sometimes insane number of tests which are found by the
  test runner.
  [hannosch]

0.5
---

- Added an option to set the effective-user.
  [optilude]

0.4
---

- Generate a bin/repozo script to perform backups using repozo.py (and
  set up the appropriate pythonpath for this to work).
  [optilude]

- Document options properly, and add the ability to specify a zope.conf
  file explicitly rather than having one generated from a template.
  [optilude]

0.3
---

- Finally found a way to provide the Zope Windows service with the right
  environment. We need a new wrapper script, which sets up the PYTHONPATH.
  [hannosch]

- Make it possible to configure the name of the zopectl script using the
  control-script option in the [instance] section.
  [wichert]

0.2
---

- Extend support for zcml slugs to include Zope 2.9.
  [dunny]

- Added support for making a ZEO-client.
  [regebro]

0.1
---

- Initial implementation.
  [hannosch]
