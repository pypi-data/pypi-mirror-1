Description: An Archetypes Schema is looked up several times each request an Archetypes is
        accessed, like 60 times or more (depends on the number of fields).
        
        This package patches the ``Schema`` method on ``BaseObject``. The Schema is
        now calculated only once and then cached in RamCache. The cache-key takes care
        about class-name, portal_type and interfaces provided by the Archetypes object.
        any suggestions what else needed are welcome. It works fine with
        ``archetypes.schemaextender`` and speeds it up.
        
        The package does not contain tests. To verify its working just run the
        Archetypes tests.
        
        To enable the package you need to import the module somewhere in your code OR
        you need to include the configure.zcml i.e. in your buildout.
        
        The module expects an eggified version of Archetypes like its shipped with Plone
        3.2 - or some fake-egg for ``Products.Archetypes``.
