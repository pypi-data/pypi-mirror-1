Description: This package speeds up Archetypes Schemas and is a patch for
        Products.Archetypes_.
        
        .. _Products.Archetypes: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.Archetypes
        
        It uses plone.memoize to cache Archetypes Schemas instead of factoring and
        modifying them every time its accessed. Factoring a schema is usally fast
        anyway. I.e. in an average Plone Site a, ATDocuemnts schema is accessed per
        request 80 times. So caching it makes sense anyway, even if a single call is
        fast. With schematuning ATDocument in PythonProfiler (which linear slows down
        whole Python) came down from 1.518s down to 0.084s for Schema calls. This makes
        it roughly 18 times faster.
        
        History
        =======
        
        Roche Compaan and Hedley Ross found while working on one if their projects
        several performance issues. One of it was the often repeated BaseObject.Schema()
        method. Read about it on the Mailing-List_.
