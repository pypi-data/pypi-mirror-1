Changelog
=========

1.2
---
* Make schema key aware of IBrowserLayerAwareExtender. This means
  schematuning can now be used safely in conjunction with schemaextender
  where schemaextender extends types per browser layer.

* It's possible (with local site-managers) to register local schema adapters.
  The cache key didn't take this into account, which meant that the wrong 
  (cached) schema without the locally extended fields would sometimes be 
  returned. The schema is now aware of any registered schema adapters,
  including from local site-managers, which fixes this problem.

* Added a tests dir with some default Archetypes tests. Also added two new
  test modules test_patch.py and test_schemaextenders.py
