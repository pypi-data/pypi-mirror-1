PuLP is an LP modeler written in python. PuLP can generate MPS or LP files
and call GLPK[1], COIN CLP/CBC[2], CPLEX[3], GUROBI[5] and XPRESS[4] to solve linear
problems.

See test1.py and test2.py for simple commented examples.
See test3.py, test4.py and test5.py for slightly more complex examples.

PuLP requires Python >= 2.5.


The examples require at least a solver in your PATH or a C module.
See test1.py to learn how to use another solver instead. It should work with
GLPK (>= 3.3), CPLEX (V11), COIN CLP/CBC (current version), GUROBI and 
XPRESS 2003c.


Some errors are not handled carefully (if at all), and documentation is
found on http://code.google.com/p/pulp-or/wiki/.

Comments, bug reports, patches and suggestions are welcome.
