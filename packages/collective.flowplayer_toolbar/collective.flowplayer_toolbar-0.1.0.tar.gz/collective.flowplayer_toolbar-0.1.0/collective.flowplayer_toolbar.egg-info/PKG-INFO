Description: How it works
        ============
        
        This product only use basic feature given to you from `Flowplayer`__.
        
        __ http://flowplayer.org/
        
        You must know that installing `collective.flowplayer`__ in your Plone site give you all the
        Flowplayer power.
        Unluckily the basic Flowplayer's controlbar is *not accessible*, but `Flowplayer APIs`__ gives
        you the power to create and handle the player with Javascript advanced features.
        
        __ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.flowplayer
        __ http://flowplayer.org/plugins/javascript/controlbar.html
        
        This product do exactly this task. The default Flash controlbar of the player in the main area will be
        disabled, and a new Javascript based ones will be shown, providing some `WAI ARIA`__ attributes.

        If you don't care about accessibility of your videos, you don't need this package
        (but obviously you are a bad guy).
