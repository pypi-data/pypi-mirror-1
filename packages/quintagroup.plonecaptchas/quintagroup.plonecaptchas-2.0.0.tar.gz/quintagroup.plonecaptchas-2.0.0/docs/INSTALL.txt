quintagroup.plonecaptchas Installation
--------------------------------------

To install quintagroup.plonecaptchas into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:

* Copy ``quintagroup`` folder to the /path/to/instance/lib/python directory.

* Create a file called ``quintagroup.plonecaptchas-overrides.zcml`` in 
the /path/to/instance/etc/package-includes directory. The file should only contain this::

  <include package="quintagroup.plonecaptchas" file="overrides.zcml" />

* Restart the Zope server, for example with the following command in the terminal::

   $ ./bin/zopectl restart

Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

* Add ``quintagroup.plonecaptchas`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        quintagroup.plonecaptchas
       
* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug:

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        quintagroup.plonecaptchas
      
* Re-run buildout, e.g. with:

    $ ./bin/buildout
        
Install quintagroup.plonecaptchas with Quickinstaller in Plone.
