Description: Plone Captchas
        ==============
        
        quintagroup.plonecaptchas is a simple captchas implementation for Plone, designed
        for validation of human input in insecure forms. This is a standalone
        implementation with static captcha images, which does not depend on captchas.net
        services.
        
        quintagroup.plonecaptchas has dynamic captchas option implemented. You can
        switch captchas into dynamic mode in the correspondent configlet. In this
        case, captcha images will be generated on the fly.
