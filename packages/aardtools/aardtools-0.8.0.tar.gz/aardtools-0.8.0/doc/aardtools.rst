Aard Tools

.. module:: aardtools
   :platform: Unix
   :synopsis: create and manipulate aard files (.aar)
.. moduleauthor:: Jeremy Mortis

Aard Dictionary uses dictionaries in it's own 
:doc:`binary format <aardformat>` designed for fast word lookups and high
compression. `Aard Tools` is a collection of tools to produce
:doc:`Aard files <aardformat>` (``.aar``).

Installation
============

.. note::
   Examples below use ``apt-get`` on Ubuntu Linux. Consult your
   distibution's packaging system to find corresponding package names
   and commands to install them. 

Prerequisits
------------

Your system must be able to compile C and C++ programs::

  sudo apt-get install build-essential

You will also need to have Python headers and setuptools_ installed::

  sudo apt-get install python-dev python-setuptools  

`Aard Tools` rely on Python interfaces to 
`International Components for Unicode`_ , which must be installed
beforehand::

  sudo apt-get install libicu38 libicu-dev
 
If you would like to get source code repository you will need
Mercurial_::

  sudo apt-get install mercurial

.. _Mercurial: http://selenic.com/mercurial
.. _setuptools: http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools
.. _International Components for Unicode: http://icu-project.org/

When compiling Wikipedia into dictionary with HTML articles `Aard
Tools` renders mathematical formulas using several tools: :command:`latex`,
:command:`blahtexml`, :command:`texvc` and :command:`dvipng`. 

Install :command:`latex`::

  sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-base

Install :command:`blahtexml` following instructions at
http://gva.noekeon.org/blahtexml/

Install :command:`texvc` (it is part of MediaWiki distribution)::

  sudo apt-get install mediawiki-math

Install :command:`dvipng`::

  sudo apt-get install dvipng

:command:`texvc` is what Wikipedia uses to render math and it's most compatible
with the TeX markup flavour used in Wikipedia articles. However, png
images produced by texvc are not transparent and don't look very
good. :command:`blahtexml` has a :command:`texvc` compatibility mode, produces better
looking images, but is more strict about TeX syntax, so it fails on
quite a few equations. So first thing article converter tries is using
:command:`latex` and :command:`dvipng` directly, with some additional LaTeX command
definitions for :command:`texvc` compatibility (borrowed from
:command:`blahtexml`). This produces best looking images and works on most
equations, but not all of them. When it fails, it falls back to
:command:`blahtexml`, and then finally :command:`texvc`. If all fails (for example
neither tools is installed) article ends up with raw math markup.

.. note::
   This applies to HTML article format (:term:`aar-HTML`), which is what aardtools 0.8.0
   uses for Wikipedia by default. Articles in older JSON format (:term:`aar-JSON`) do not
   support math rendering. 

.. warning::
   aarddict 0.7.x can't render :term:`aar-HTML` articles, will show raw HTML. 

Installation
------------

Download source code::

  wget http://www.bitbucket.org/itkach/aardtools/get/tip.bz2

or 

::

  hg clone http://www.bitbucket.org/itkach/aardtools

Assuming source code code is in `aardtools` directory::

  cd aardtools
  sudo python setup.py install   

Usage
=====
Entry point for `Aard Tools` is ``aardc`` command - Aard Dictionary compiler. It
requires two arguments: input file type and input file name. Input
file type is the name of Python module that actually reads input files and
performs article conversion. `Aard Tools` "out of the box" comes with
support for the following input types: 

xdxf 
    Dictionaries in XDXF_ format (only `XDXF-visual`_ is supported).

wiki
    Wikipedia articles and templates :abbr:`CDB (Constant Database)`
    built with :command:`mw-buildcdb` from Wikipedia XML dump.

aard
    Dictionaries in aar format. This is useful for updating dictionary metadata
    and changing the way it is split into volumes. Multiple input files can
    be combined into one single or multi volume fictionary.

.. _XDXF: http://xdxf.sourceforge.net/
.. _XDXF-visual: http://xdxf.revdanica.com/drafts/visual/latest/XDXF-draft-028.txt

Synopsis::

  aardc [options] (wiki|xdxf|aard) FILE [FILE2 [FILE3 ...]]

.. note::
   Only `aard` input type allows multiple files.

Compiling Wiki XML Dump
-----------------------

Get a Wiki dump to compile, for example::

  wget http://download.wikimedia.org/simplewiki/20081227/simplewiki-20081227-pages-articles.xml.bz2

Build mwlib article database::

  mw-buildcdb --input  simplewiki-20081227-pages-articles.xml.bz2 --output simplewiki-20081227-pages-articles.cdb

Original dump is not needed after this, it may be deleted or moved to
free up disk space. Compile aar dictionary from the article database::

 aardc wiki simplewiki-20081227-pages-articles.cdb

Compiler infers from the input file name that Wikipedia language
is "simple" and that version is 20081227. These need to be specified
explicitely through command line options if cdb directory name doesn't
follow the pattern of the xml dump file names. Compiler also
looks for files with license and copyright notice texts and dictionary
metadata, first in the language of the wiki and then in
English. English versions of these files are included. 

.. note::
   Make sure :file:`{mwlibdir}/mwlib/siteinfo` directory contains
   file :file:`siteinfo-{lang}.json` for language of wiki to be
   compiled. If it doesn't - run
   :samp:`{mwlibdir}/mwlib/siteinfo/fetch_siteinfo.py {lang}`.

Compiling XDXF Dictionaries
---------------------------

Get a XDXF dictionary, for example::

  wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/xdxf/comn_dictd04_wn.tar.bz2 

Compile aar dictionary:: 
 
  aardc xdxf comn_dictd04_wn.tar.bz2

Compiling Aard Dictionaries
---------------------------
.aar dictionaries themselves can be used as input for aardc. This is useful
when dictionary's metadata need to be updated or dictionary needs to be split
up into several smaller volumes. For example, to split large dictionary
`dict.aar` into volumes with maximum size of 10 Mb run:: 

  aardc aard dict.aar -o dict-split.aar -s 10m

If `dict.aar` is, say, 15 Mb this will produce two files: 10 Mb `dict-split.1_of_2.aar`
and 5Mb `dict-split.2_of_2.aar`. 

To update dictionary metadata::

  aardc aard dict.aar -o dict2.aar --metadata dict.ini
