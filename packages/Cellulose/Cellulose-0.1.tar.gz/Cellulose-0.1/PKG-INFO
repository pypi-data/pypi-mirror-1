Description: 
        Cellulose provides a mechanism for maintaining consistency between
        inter-dependant values with caching and lazy evaluation.
        
        You can think of it like a spreadsheet program --  Many cells are are calculated
        from the values of other cells.  When one cell changes, all of the dependant
        cells get updated with new values.
        
        However, cellulose goes quite a ways beyond this.  It guarantees that when a
        value is read, it is consistant with all the values it depends on.  It also is
        lazy (read: efficient.)  Calculating a value is put off till the very last
        possible moment, and only recalculated when absolutely needed.
        
        Dependency discovery and cache invalidation are fully transparent and automatic.
        This greatly reduces a major source of bugs in software.
        
        A goal of the project is to be as simple as possible, (but no simpler,) so that
        anyone wanting to seriously use it could easily understand the internals.
