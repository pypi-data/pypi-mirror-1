I would like to thank Ken Tilton, Ryan Forsythe, and James Tauber for the Lisp
Cells module, PyCells, and mentoring the google summer of code project,
respectively.  Seeing PyCells on the summer of code projects list gave me an
epiphany that my algorithm could be used anywhere, not just as a side-project of
a side-project.  Thanks guys!
