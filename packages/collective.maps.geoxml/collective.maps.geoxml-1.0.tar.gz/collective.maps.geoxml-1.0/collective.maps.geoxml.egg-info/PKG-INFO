        Introduction
        ============
        
        GeoXml content stores kml (Keyhole Markup Language), the view renders the
        file in a Google Map (as EGeoXml object from egeoxml library).
        
        To work with Plone I have used the egeoxml.js library that permits to
        download kml file from any location (GGeoXml works only with file hosted
        on a publicly accessible web server)
        
        GeoXml depends on Maps for the configuration of Google apikey (but you can
        modify the view.pt file to use a static apikey and remove Maps)
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Create a Plone site with GeoXml and Maps profile or import these profiles
        from portal_setup.
