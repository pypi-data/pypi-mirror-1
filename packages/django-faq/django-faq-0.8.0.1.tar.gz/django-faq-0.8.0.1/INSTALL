Thanks for downloading django-faq.

To install it, make sure you have Python 2.4 or greater and Django trunk r9742
or greater installed. Then run this command from the command prompt:

    python setup.py install

Note this requires a working Internet connection if you don't already have the
Python utility "setuptools" installed.

AS AN ALTERNATIVE, you can just copy the entire "faq" directory to Python's
site-packages directory, which is located wherever your Python installation
lives. Some places you might check are:

    /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages (Unix, Python 2.4)
    C:\\PYTHON\site-packages         (Windows)

This second solution does not require a working Internet connection; it
bypasses "setuptools" entirely.
