TurboMail is a TurboGears extension - meaning that it starts up and
shuts down alongside TurboGears applications you write in the same
way that visit tracking and identity do.  TurboMail uses built-in
Python modules for SMTP communication and MIME e-mail creation, but
greatly simplifies these tasks by performing the grunt-work for you.
