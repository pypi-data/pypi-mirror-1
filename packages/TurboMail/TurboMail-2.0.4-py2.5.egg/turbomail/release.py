"""Release information about the Turbo-Mail mail queue."""

version = "2.0.4"
description = "Multi-threaded mail queue manager for TurboGears applications."
long_description = "TurboMail is a TurboGears extension, meaning that it starts up and shuts down alongside any TurboGears applications you write, in the same way that visit tracking and identity do. TurboMail uses built-in Python modules for SMTP communication and MIME e-mail creation, but greatly simplifies these tasks by performing the grunt-work for you. Additionally, TurboMail is multi-threaded, allowing for single or batch enqueueing and background delivery of mail."
