Release Information
-------------------

This is first alpha release of EasyExtend 3.0. It is expected to contain still lots of 
bugs.

EE 3.0 is undertested. Currently only tests for the gallery langlet are shipped.
Older tests that applied to EE 2.0 are broken and can't be reused.

I also refused to package documentation. All available 
documentation is accessible online at http://www.fiber-space.de/EasyExtend/doc/EE.html
