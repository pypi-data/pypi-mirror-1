0.3.1 (2009-01-20)
==================

* Introduce sensible sort order for relations, based on a
  ``(from_attribute, from_path, to_path)`` tuple.

* Relations will now never compare to ``None``. 

0.3 (2009-01-19)
================

* Introduce two new interfaces: ``IHasOutgoingRelations`` and
  ``IHasIncomingRelations``. ``IHasOutgoingRelations`` should be provided
  by objects that actually have relations set on them, so that 
  they can be properly cataloged. ``IHasIncomingRelations`` should be
  set on objects that can be related to, so that broken relations
  can be properly tracked. ``IHasRelations`` now extends both,
  so if you provide those on your object you have an object that can
  have both outgoing as well as incoming relations.

* Improve broken relations support. When you now break a relation (by
  removing the relation target), ``to_id`` and ``to_object`` become
  ``None``. ``to_path`` however will remain the path that the relation
  last pointed to. ``TemporaryRelation`` objects that when realized
  are broken relations can also be created.

  You can also for broken status by calling ``isBroken`` on a
  relation.

* The signature of the top-level function ``create_relation``
  changed. It used to take the object to which the relation was to be
  created, but should now get the path (in ``IObjectPath`` terms).
  ``create_relation`` will now create a broken relation object if the
  path cannot be resolved.

0.2 (2009-01-08)
================

* Added support for ``RelationList`` fields. This allows one to
  maintain a list of ``RelationValue`` objects that will be cataloged
  like the regular ``Relation`` fields.

* Get rid of ``IRelationInfo`` adapter requirement. Just define a
  ``create_relation`` function that does the same work.

* When looking for relations on an object be more tolerant if those
  cannot be found (just skip them) - this can happen when a schema is
  changed.

0.1 (2008-12-05)
================

* Initial public release.
