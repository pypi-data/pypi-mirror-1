  - http://ubuntu.com/ Ubuntu
  - http://www.debian.org/ Debian GNU/Linux
  - http://fedora.redhat.com/ Fedora Core

How to write test scripts using ldtp for your module ?

  - How to create LDTP test scripts in python - http://ldtp.freedesktop.org/wiki/LDTP_20test_20scripts_20in_20python
  - Refer existing pyautosuite test scripts - http://webcvs.freedesktop.org/ldtp/pyautosuite
  - Refer API Reference page for list of LDTP functions available - http://ldtp.freedesktop.org/user-doc/index.html

How to use LDTP for applications running in Localized languages?

  - Identify the mo files used by the application
  - Use bindtext in the script for each mo file identified as shown below
    Example: For mo file with name: "/opt/gnome/share/locale/ta/LC_MESSAGES/gedit.mo"
                bindtext ('gedit', '/opt/gnome/share/locale')
             For mo file with name: "/opt/gnome/share/locale/ta/LC_MESSAGES/gtk20.mo"
                bindtext ('gtk20', '/opt/gnome/share/locale')
  - Make sure that the LANG variable is set to appropriate value

Localization limitations

  - Currently only mo files are handled. We are working on it to provide support for message catalogs in other formats (example: jar, etc.,) as well.
  - Searching of mo files to be used for bindtext is done only in specific folders. We have make the file search similar to gettext library.
