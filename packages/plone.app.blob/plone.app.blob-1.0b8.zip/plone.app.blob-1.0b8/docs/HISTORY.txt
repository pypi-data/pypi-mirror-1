    - Fix image field validator to match that from `ATContentTypes`.
      [rossp]

    - With `ATContentTypes` >=2.0, check the `_should_set_id_to_filename`
      method to determine if `ATBlob`'s `fixAutoId` method should set the
      item id to the filename of the blob field.  For images, don't set it
      to the filename if a title was supplied.
      [davisagli]

    - Add blobbable adapters for Python file objects and OFS Pdata objects.

      and avoid unnecessary re-indexing.
      [witsch]

    - Fix registration of blob-based image scale adapter to prevent getting
      404s for content other than images.  This fixes the second issue

      [witsch]

      [witsch]

    - Add missing acquisition-wrapper, also allowing to remove circular
      references between instance and field, which broke pickling.
      [witsch]

    - Fix helper for determining image sizes to not break for non-image
      content.
      [witsch]

    - Use PIL for determining image sizes as the OFS code cannot handle
      certain types of JPEGs.

plone.app.blob - 1.0b2 Released February 29, 2008

    - Reverted fix for Windows that closed the file upload object in order
      to work around a problem with reading from the blob file afterwards.
      [witsch]

plone.app.blob - 1.0b1 Released February 28, 2008

    - Minor bug fixes and cleanups
      [witsch]

    - Fix for a problem regarding file uploads on Windows, where renaming
      the still open temporary file isn't allowed and hence caused an error.
      Now the file is closed before the call to `consumeFile()`.
      [rochael]

    - Fix for Windows regarding the generation of the temporary file used for
      file uploads so that it doesn't get deleted after being moved to the
      blob storare
      [rochael]

    - Change file size calculation so as not to need to reopen the file, which
      broke on Windows
      [rochael]

    - Changed the primary field of the blob content types to not to be
      "searchable" as this causes indexing of the blob content making ram
      consumption go through the roof
