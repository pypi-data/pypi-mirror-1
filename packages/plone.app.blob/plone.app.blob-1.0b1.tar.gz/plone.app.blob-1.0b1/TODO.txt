todos:
- answer remaining questions in the faq section
- image support:  sub-type, scaling, migration etc
- document administration & backup issues
- document motivation for blobs & design decision
- figure out a backup solution for repozo (for the common case):
  perhaps using zope tids to stay in sync and rsync for the actual blob backup
