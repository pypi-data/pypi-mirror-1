      [witsch]

plone.app.blob - 1.0b3 Released May 15, 2009

    - Clean up GenericSetup profiles to allow separate installation of
      replacement types for "File" and "Image" content.
      [witsch]

      This fixes http://plone.org/products/plone.app.blob/issues/12

      [stefan]

    - Remove quota argument from DemoStorage calls.
      [stefan]

    - Add workaround to prevent breakage with CMFEditions (blob-based
      content can still not be versioned, though).
      [witsch]

    - Add missing acquisition-wrapper, also allowing to remove circular
      references between instance and field, which broke pickling.
      [witsch]

    - Fix helper for determining image sizes to not break for non-image
      content.
      [witsch]

    - Use PIL for determining image sizes as the OFS code cannot handle
      certain types of JPEGs.
      [witsch]

    - Added missing metadata.xml to the default profile.
      [hannosch]

    - Only use the file name for id generation for the replacement types,
      i.e. "File" and "Image", but not custom types.  This fixes
      http://plone.org/products/plone.app.blob/issues/3
      [witsch]

    - Fix issue where the mime-type registry returned an empty tuple when
      looking up an unknown mime-type.  This fixes
      http://plone.org/products/plone.app.blob/issues/1
      [witsch]

plone.app.blob - 1.0b2 Released February 29, 2008

    - Reverted fix for Windows that closed the file upload object in order
      to work around a problem with reading from the blob file afterwards.
      [witsch]

plone.app.blob - 1.0b1 Released February 28, 2008

    - Minor bug fixes and cleanups
      [witsch]

    - Fix for a problem regarding file uploads on Windows, where renaming
      the still open temporary file isn't allowed and hence caused an error.
      Now the file is closed before the call to `consumeFile()`.
      [rochael]

    - Fix for Windows regarding the generation of the temporary file used for
      file uploads so that it doesn't get deleted after being moved to the
      blob storare
      [rochael]

    - Change file size calculation so as not to need to reopen the file, which
      broke on Windows
      [rochael]

    - Changed the primary field of the blob content types to not to be
      "searchable" as this causes indexing of the blob content making ram
      consumption go through the roof
      [witsch]

    - Various minor bug fixes regarding migration, content icons etc

      as the "File" content type
      [witsch]
