Description: superlance plugins for supervisor
        =================================
        
        Superlance is a package of plugin utilities for monitoring and
        controlling processes that run under `supervisor
        <http://supervisord.org>`_.
        
        Currently, it provides only one script named ``httpok``.  This script
        can be used as a supervisor event listener (subscribed to TICK events)
        which will restart a "hung" HTTP server process, which is defined as a
        process in the RUNNING state which does not respond in an appropriate
        or timely manner to an HTTP GET request.
