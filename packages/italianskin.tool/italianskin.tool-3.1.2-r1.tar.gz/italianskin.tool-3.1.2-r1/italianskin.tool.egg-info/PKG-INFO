        ================
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        italianskin.tool provides a tool for italianskin; you can also use the tool without italianskin.templates.
        You're now free to choose between three given styles or even use your own customised style just adding a css file from the ZMI interface and setting its name and class id on the italianskin.tool graphic interface. No javascript needed.
        
        A few info on the styles you'll find as default:
        
        Plone Default (contrast improved) - some light changes for a better contrast on plone default style
        
        High Contrast (background black)  - changes on background, font, link for dark colors, a better contrast in a plone default style.
        
        High Contrast (background black - Padding/fonts modified) - following High Contrast changes on colors, it emphasizes dimensions (fonts, paddings, margins; no borders or images), a high-visibility layout thought expressly for partially-sighted people.
        
        
        
        Answering the free software issue about an open source code, ItalianSkin is released under the same licence as Plone.
