Description: 
        This (yagt) is a reimplementation of pyGTrends by Sal Uryasev
        (http://www.juiceanalytics.com/openjuice/programmatic-google-trends-api/).  The
        authentication and connection of yagt are borrowed from Sal Uryasev's
        pyGTrends.  In addition to provide a more Pythonic way to manipulate the
        downloaded data, yagt also give you a simple command line interface (CLI) to
        grab data from Google Trends and save to a csv file.
        
        After install the module, you can access the simple CLI by using:
        
        $ python -m yagt <query1> <query2> <-u username> [options]
        
        The output will be saved to "result.csv" by default.  For more information
        about the options, please use "python -m yagt -h" for the help page.
