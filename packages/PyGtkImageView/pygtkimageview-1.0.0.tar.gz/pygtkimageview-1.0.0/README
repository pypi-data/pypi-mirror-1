This is the README file for PyGtkImageView.

PyGtkImageView is the Python language binding for the GTK widget
GtkImageView.

Compilation
===========

Compilation requires that gtkimageview and pygtk are installed. And
then:

    $ ./configure --prefix=/some/prefix
    $ make
    $ make install

Note that you should have gtkimageview-1.5.0 installed. Older versions
may also work, but there is no guarantee.

Example
=======

    import gtkimageview
    import gtk
    from gtk import gdk
    
    view = gtkimageview.ImageView()
    view.set_pixbuf(gdk.pixbuf_new_from_file("yourimage.png"))
    win = gtk.Window()
    win.add(view)
    win.show_all()
    gtk.main()

More example code exists in the ./tests/demo??.py files.

Tests
=====
Unit tests exist in the directory ./tests. To run them you must have
nosetests installed. Run the tests by typing:

    nosetests -w tests

in the root directory. The package must first be installed for this to
work.

Documentation
=============
Documentation can be found in the ./docs directory. HTML and PDF
documentation is generated by the bash script makedocs.sh. For it to
work, you need to have:

* epydoc 3.0 beta (install from source)
* latex (the packages tetex-bin and tetex-extra on Ubuntu)
* docutils

Then just run the script from the ./docs dir:

    ./makedocs.sh

The source for the documentation is found in the
./docs/gtkimageview.py file.
