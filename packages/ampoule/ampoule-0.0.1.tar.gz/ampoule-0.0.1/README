ampoule - Python process pool for Twisted Matrix
=================================================

ampoule is a process pool implementation written on top of Twisted
Matrix. Its name comes from the use of AMP as the default
communication protocol between the pool and all its children.

It's different from other alternative solutions because it provides an
API that is very close to the ThreadPool built into Twisted itself. It
also provides the helper function deferToAMPProcess that is very close
to deferToThread.
