Ampoule 0.0.2 (2008-09-26)
==========================

Features
--------
 - Support process recycling after predefined number of calls.

Changes
-------
 - ProcessPool argument max_idle is now maxIdle to comply with Twisted
   style guidelines.

 - ProcessPool.startAWorker is now a synchronous call

 - removed ampoule.runner module because it was essentially useless,
   if you want to change subprocess startup behavior pass it as an
   argument by overriding the processFactory with a closure like this:
       
       from ampoule.main import startAMPProcess
       from ampoule.pool import ProcessPool
       pp = ProcessPool()
       def myProcessFactory(*args, **kwargs):
           kwargs['bootstrap'] = myBootstrapCode
           return startAMPProcess(*args, **kwargs)
       pp.processFactory = staticmethod(myProcessFactory)
