Description: Zope3 Internationalization Support
        ==================================
        
        This package implements several APIs related to internationalization and
        localization.
        
        * Locale objects for all locales maintained by the ICU project.
        
        * Gettext-based message catalogs for message strings.
        
        * Locale discovery for Web-based requests.

        CHANGES
        =======
        
        3.4.0 (2007-10-02)
        ------------------
        
        - Updated meta-data. No code changes.
        
        
        3.4.0b5 (2007-08-15)
        --------------------
        
        - Bug: Fixed dependency on ``zope.component`` to require it with the 'zcml'
        extra instead of requiring ``zope.security`` directly.
        
        
        3.4.0b4 (2007-07-19)
        --------------------
        
        - Bug: Number parsing was too forgiving, allowing non-numerical and/or
        formatting characters before, after and within the number. The parsing is
        more strict now.
        
        
        3.4.0b3 (2007-06-28)
        --------------------
        
        - Bug: There was a bug in the parser that if no decimal place is given
        you still had to type the decimal symbol. Corrected this problem (one
        character ;-) and provided a test.
        
        
        3.4.0b2 (2007-06-25)
        --------------------
        
        - Feature: Added ability to change the output type when parsing a
        number.
        
        
        3.4.0b1 (?)
        -----------
        
        - Bug: Fixed dependency on ``zope.security`` to require a version that
        does not have the hidden dependency on ``zope.testing``.
        
        
        Note: Releases between 3.2.0 and 3.4.0b1 were not tracked as individual
        packages. The changes can be reconstructed from the Zope 3 changelog.
        
        
        3.2.0 (2006-01-05)
        ------------------
        
        - Corresponds to the verison of the zope.i18n package shipped as part of the
        Zope 3.2.0 release.
        
        - Added a picklable offset-based timezone to 'pytz', a la
        zope.app.datetimeutils'.  Added tests in 'zope.i18n' to show that we need
        something like it, and then actually use it in 'zope.18n.format'.
        
        - Added support for parsing / formatting timezones using 'pytz' (new external
        dependency).
        
        - Implemented remaining date/time formatters, including adding week
        information to the calendar.
        
        
        3.0.0 (2004-11-07)
        ------------------
        
        - Corresponds to the version of the zope.i18n package shipped as part of
        the Zope X3.0.0 release.
