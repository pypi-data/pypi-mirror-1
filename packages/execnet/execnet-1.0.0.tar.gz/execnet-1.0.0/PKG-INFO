Description: 
        the execnet package allows to:
        
        * instantiate local/remote Python Interpreters
        * send code for execution to one or many Interpreters
        * send and receive data between codeInterpreters through channels
        
        execnet performs **zero-install bootstrapping** into other interpreters;
        package installation is only required at the initiating side.  execnet enables
        interoperation between CPython 2.4-3.1, Jython 2.5 and PyPy 1.1 and works
        well on Windows, Linux and OSX systems.
        
        execnet was written and is maintained by Holger Krekel with contributions from many others.  The package is licensed under the GPL Version 2 or later, at your choice.  Contributions and some parts of the package are licensed under the MIT license.
