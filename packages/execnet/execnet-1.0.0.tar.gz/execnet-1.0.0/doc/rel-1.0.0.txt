Hi all,

i just uploaded execnet-1.0.0 to PYPI and updated the docs at 

    http://codespeak.net/execnet/

execnet enables zero-install ad-hoc instantiation of local or remote
Python processes.  It allows to open channels for basic data communication.
Data Serialization is independent from Python's 'pickle' and is tested between 
Python2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 3.1 and Jython interpreters.  

As always, i am happy about any feedback particularly since
i plan to invest some more time into advancing execnet.

cheers, 
holger 

Changes from 1.0.0 compared to 1.0.0b3
-------------------------------------------

* introduce execnet.Group for managing gateway creation 
  and termination.  Introduce execnet.default_group through which 
  all "global" calls are routed.  cleanup gateway termination.
  All Gateways get an id through which they can be 
  retrieved from a group object.

* deprecate execnet.XYZGateway in favour of direct makegateway() calls.

* refine socketserver-examples, experimentally introduce a
  way to indirectly setup a socket server ("installvia")
  through a gateway url.

* refine and automatically test documentation examples
