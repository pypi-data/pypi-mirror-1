Description: ``repoze.urispace`` README
        ==========================
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        ``repoze.urispace`` implements the
        `URISpace <http://www.w3.org/TR/urispace.html>`_ 1.0 spec, as proposed
        to the W3C by Akamai.  Its aim is to provide an implementation of
        that language as a vehicle for asserting declarative metadata about a
        resource based on pattern matching against its URI.
        
        Once asserted, such metadata can be used to guide the application in
        serving the resource, with possible applciations including:
        
        - Setting cache control headers.
        
        - Selecting externally applied themes, e.g. in ``Deliverance``.
        
        - Restricting access, e.g. to emulate Zope's "placeful security."
        
        Please see the `package docs <http://packages.python.org/repoze.urispace>`_
        for detailed documentation.
