Description: plone.recipe.atcontenttypes
        ===========================
        
        This recipe generate a custom ATContentTypes configuration file and place it in
        the etc/ folder of your zope instance.
        
        You can use it with a part like this:
        
        [atcontenttypes-conf]
        recipe                 = plone.recipe.atcontenttypes
        zope-instance-location = /home/kevin/instance/etc/
        
        Generally, we use this recipe in combination with a zope instance part. Here is
        an example base on plone.recipe.zope2instance documentation
        ( http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.recipe.zope2instance ):
        
        [instance]
        recipe         = plone.recipe.zope2instance
        zope2-location = /path/to/zope2/install
        user           = admin:admin
        http-address   = 8080
        eggs           = ${buildout:eggs} my.package
        products       = ${buildout:directory}/products
        zcml           = my.package
        
        [atcontenttypes-conf]
        recipe                 = plone.recipe.atcontenttypes
        zope-instance-location = ${instance:location}
        max-file-size          = ATImage:1mb
        ATFile:100mb
        ATNewsItem:500kb
        max-image-dimension    = ATNewsItem:640,400
        ATImage:2048,2048
        
        Options
        -------
        
        zope-instance-location
        The path where your zope instance is installed. If you are also using the
        plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe (like the second example above), and you
        have that configured as a part called 'instance' prior to the atcontenttypes
        part, you can use ${instance:location} for this parameter.
        
        max-file-size (default: no)
        This option let you set the maximum file size (in byte, kb or mb). You can
        specify different file size limit, one for each content type.
        Example:
        max-file-size = ATImage:1mb
        ATFile:100mb
        ATNewsItem:500kb
        
        max-image-dimension (default: 0,0)
        This option let you set the maximum image dimension ("w, h"). "0,0" means no
        rescaling of the original image. This option is per-content-type and its
        syntax is the same as above.
        Example:
        max-image-dimension = ATNewsItem:640,400
        ATImage:2048,2048
