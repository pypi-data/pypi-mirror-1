1.0.1
=====

- Incorporated test and bug fix from Gabriel Shaar::

  if the target parameter is a container with no objects, then
  `shared.AbstractContainer.isLinked` resolves to False in a bool context and
  tokenization fails.  `target and tokenize({'target': target})` returns the
  target instead of the result of the tokenize function.

- Made README.txt tests pass on hopefully wider set of machines (this was a
  test improvement; the relationship index did not have the fragility).
  Reported by Gabriel Shaar.
