Description: The Zope ClockServer product provides a mechanism for users to call Zope object methods without the use of an external clock source (e.g. cron/wget). It operates by acting as a medusa "server", essentially coopting Zope's asyncore mainloop and injecting "fake" requests into Zope's ZPublisher. Despite the complicated description, it's rather easy to use.
