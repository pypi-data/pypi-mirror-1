Description: 
        ScanBooker is a domainmodel application, designed to support medical imaging administration. ScanBooker has a rich model of the medical imaging domain, which provides for tracking organisations, groups, researchers, training level, projects, ethics approvals, cost accounting, volunteers, and more. ScanBooker also provides a calendar for scheduling sessions with close reference to the model. ScanBooker was originally developed in a collaboration between the UK's Medical Research Council and the Appropriate Software Foundation. ScanBooker is stable, under active development, and upgrades are released with a tested data migration path.
