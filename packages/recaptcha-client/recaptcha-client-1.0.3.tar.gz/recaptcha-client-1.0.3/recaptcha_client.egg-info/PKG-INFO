Description: Provides a CAPTCHA for Python using the reCAPTCHA service. Does not require
        any imaging libraries because the CAPTCHA is served directly from reCAPTCHA.
        Also allows you to securely obfuscate emails with Mailhide. This functionality
        requires pycrypto. This library requires two types of API keys. If you'd like
        to use the CAPTCHA, you'll need a key from http://recaptcha.net/api/getkey.
        For Mailhide, you'll need a key from http://mailhide.recaptcha.net/apikey.
        
        The trunk can be checked out from
        http://recaptcha.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/recaptcha-plugins/python,
        and the associated Google Code project lives at
        http://code.google.com/p/recaptcha.
