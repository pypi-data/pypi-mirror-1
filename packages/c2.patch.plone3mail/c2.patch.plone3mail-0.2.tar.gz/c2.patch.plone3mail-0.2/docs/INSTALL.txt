Installation
==================================

* When you're reading this you have probably already run
  ``easy_install c2.patch.plone3mail``. Find out how to install setuptools
  (and EasyInstall) here:
  http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall

* Create a file called ``c2.patch.plone3mail-configure.zcml`` in the
  ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
  should only contain this::

       <include package="c2.patch.plone3mail" />


Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this.

* Add ``c2.patch.plone3mail`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        c2.patch.plone3mail

* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        c2.patch.plone3mail

* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::

    $ ./bin/buildout

You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.
