        ----------------
        
        * Initial release
        
        Installation
        ==================================
        
        * When you're reading this you have probably already run
        ``easy_install c2.patch.plone3mail``. Find out how to install setuptools
        (and EasyInstall) here:
        http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall
        
        * Create a file called ``c2.patch.plone3mail-configure.zcml`` in the
        ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
        should only contain this::
        
        <include package="c2.patch.plone3mail" />
        
        
        Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
        recipe to manage your project, you can do this.
        
        * Add ``c2.patch.plone3mail`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
        
        [buildout]
        ...
        eggs =
        ...
        c2.patch.plone3mail
        
        * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::
        
        [instance]
        recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
        ...
        zcml =
        c2.patch.plone3mail
        
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
        
        $ ./bin/buildout
        
        You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
        from another package's configure.zcml file.
