Description: ======

        ======
        
        The LDAPMultiPlugins provides PluggableAuthService plugins that use LDAP as
        the backend for the services they provide. The PluggableAuthService is a
        Zope user folder product that can be extended in modular fashion using
        various plugins. See DEPENDENCIES.txt for software needed by this package.
        
        Please make sure to read the documentation included in the LDAPUserFolder
        package as well.
        
        
        Caching
        -------
        
        The results of some calls into the plugins provided by these package can be
        cached using the Zope ZCacheable mechanism:
        
        - In the Zope Management Interface (ZMI) of your PluggableAuthService
        instance, select 'RAM Cache Manager' from the dropdown, give it an ID
        and configure it according to your needs.
        
        - Click on your LDAP/ActiveDirectoryMultiPlugin and use the 'Cache'
        ZMI tab on the far right to associate the newly created RAM Cache
        Manager object with the plugin.
        
        Now your plugin will use the RAM Cache Manager object to cache results from
        some of the possibly expensive API calls.
        
        
        Special features - Active Directory Multi Plugin
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        Properties of the ADMultiPlugin instance:
        
        - groupid_attr - the LDAP attribute used for group ids.
        
        - grouptitle_attr - the LDAP attribute used to compose group titles.
        
        - group_class - the LDAP class of group objects.
        
        - group_recurse - boolean indicating whether to determine group
        memberships of a user by unrolling nested group relationships
        (expensive). This feature is not guaranteed to work at this moment.
        
        
        Active Directory configuration hints
        ------------------------------------
        
        In order for groups support to work correctly, you may have to set the
        following properties. Every situation is different, but this has helped
        some people succeed:
        
        - On the "Properties" tab for the ActiveDirectoryMultiPlugin, set the
        groupid_attr property to "name".
        
        - On the contained LDAPUserFolder's "Configure" tab, choose a
        property other than "objectGUID", e.g. "sAMAccountName" for the
        User ID property. To get to the LDAPUserFolder, click on the
        ActiveDirectoryMultiPlugin "Content" tab.
        
        Please see README.ActiveDirectory from the LDAPUserFolder package for
        additional information.

        1.6 (2008-06-05)
        ----------------
        
        - Bug: ActiveDirectoryMultiPlugin.enumerateGroups: In order to support
        group searches on the binary objectGUID attribute, utilize a new
        flag exposed by the LDAPUserFolder LDAPDelegate search method
        that prevents the customary UTF8-encoding of the search filter
        expression. **NOTE**: With this change the LDAPUserFolder version
        dependency changes to version 2.9 or higher!
        (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00576 by Wichert Akkerman)
        
        - Bug: ActiveDirectoryMultiPlugin.enumerateGroups: If the requested group
        id is a binary string, like a objectGUID attribute, it was mangled
        by a lowercasing operation. Removed the lowercasing.
        (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00575 by Wichert Akkerman)
        
        - Feature: Added caching to the getGroupsForPrincipal method. Thanks to
        Wichert Akkerman for the patch.

        1.5 (2007-06-13)
        ----------------
        
        - Bug: The product will no longer silently fail to install if the
        LDAPUserFolder package is not installed. Silent failure does
        not look like a good strategy here.
        
        - Bug: fixes and import cleanups after running Pyflakes
        (http://divmod.org:81/svn/Divmod/trunk/Pyflakes/)
        
        - Documentation: added some additional configuration hints to the README,
        thanks go to Brett Lentz (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00559)
