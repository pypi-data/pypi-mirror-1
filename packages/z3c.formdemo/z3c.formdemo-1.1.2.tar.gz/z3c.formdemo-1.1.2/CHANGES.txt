Version 1.1.2 (6/25/2007)
-------------------------

- Bug: Provide optionalChoice field in the content type. Pre-1.3.0 releases of
  ``z3c.form`` simply ignored missing fields, but the latest version reports
  the error. Thanks to Luke Miller for the report.

Version 1.1.1 (6/24/2007)
-------------------------

- Bug: Add new ``zope.rdb`` dependency to the setup and buildout
  configuration.

Version 1.1.0 (6/22/2007)
-------------------------

- Feature: New "SQL Message" demo shows how ``z3c.form`` can be used with
  non-object data. Specificically, this small application demonstrates using a
  Gadfly database using pure SQL calls without any ORM.

- Feature: New "Address Book" demo that demonstrates more complex use cases,
  such as subforms, composite widgets, and mappings/lists


Version 1.0.0 (5/24/2007)
-------------------------

- Initial Release
