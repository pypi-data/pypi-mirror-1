1.1.0 (2009-11-18)
------------------

- Fixed an important error on the tag update handling : tags were
  registered more than once if an update was made for the same user,
  item and tag. The issue came from the set comparison method, that
  uses the hash and not a classical cmp method. We had to introduce a
  comparison basis we called "brain" in order to get the expected
  behavior. A test was added to emphasis this behavior. [trollfot]


1.0.0 (2009-07-24)
------------------

- Fixed tests to conform to latest packages.

- Cleanup release boilerplate.


0.3.0b2 (2007-07-18)
--------------------

- in case of a not matching query lovely.tag will not longer return
  None but an empty IFTreeSet. (this is caused because zope.app.catalog
  will ignore None which results in a boolean or operation)


0.3.0b1 (2007-06-13)
--------------------

- use iobtree for tag persistence instead of persistent list and intid
  util, should be much faster now with big numbers of tags. (this is a
  new database generation)
