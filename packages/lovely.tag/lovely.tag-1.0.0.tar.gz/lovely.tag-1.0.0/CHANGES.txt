1.0.0 (2009-07-24)
------------------

- Fixed tests to conform to latest packages.

- Cleanup release boilerplate.

0.3.0b2 (2007-07-18)
--------------------

- in case of a not matching query lovely.tag will not longer return
  None but an empty IFTreeSet. (this is caused because zope.app.catalog
  will ignore None which results in a boolean or operation)


0.3.0b1 (2007-06-13)
--------------------

- use iobtree for tag persistence instead of persistent list and intid
  util, should be much faster now with big numbers of tags. (this is a
  new database generation)
