0.2 (2007-09-05)
================

 - Fixed problem with methods not being passed parameters from the
   query string. When a view method was called directly using an URL
   the parameters from the query string were lost when a view method
   was decorated. The decorators now push back the query parameters
   into the method call.

0.1 (2007-08-31)
================

 - First public release.
