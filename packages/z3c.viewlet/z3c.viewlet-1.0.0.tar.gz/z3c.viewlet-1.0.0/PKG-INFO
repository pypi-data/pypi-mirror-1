        Viewlet Extensions
        ==================
        
        This package provides extensions to the basic ``zope.viewlet`` package
        functionality.
        
        
        Weight-Ordered Viewlet Manager
        ------------------------------
        
        The viewlet manager in ``zope.viewlet`` does not implement a particular way of
        sorting the viewlets it represents. This was intentional, since the authors
        did not want to suggest a particular method of sorting viewlets. Over time,
        however, it turns out that sorting viewlets by a relative weight is very
        useful and sufficient for most situations.
        
        >>> from z3c.viewlet import manager
        
        Every viewlet displayed by a weight-ordered viewlet manager is expected to
        have a ``weight`` attribute that is an integer; it can also be a string that
        can be converted to an integer. If a viewlet does not have this attribute, a
        weight of zero is assumed.
        
        The manager uses a helper function to extract the weight. So let's create a
        dummy viewlet:
        
        >>> class Viewlet(object):
        ...   pass
        
        >>> viewlet = Viewlet()
        
        Initially, there is no weight attribute, so the weight is zero.
        
        >>> manager.getWeight(('viewlet', viewlet))
        0
        
        If the viewlet has a weight, ...
        
        >>> viewlet.weight = 1
        
        ... it is returned:
        
        >>> manager.getWeight(('viewlet', viewlet))
        1
        
        As mentioned before, the weight can also be a string representation of an
        integer:
        
        >>> viewlet.weight = '2'
        >>> manager.getWeight(('viewlet', viewlet))
        2
        
        Let's now check that the sorting works correctly for the manager:
        
        >>> zero = Viewlet()
        
        >>> one = Viewlet()
        >>> one.weight = 1
        
        >>> two = Viewlet()
        >>> two.weight = '2'
        
        >>> viewlets = manager.WeightOrderedViewletManager(None, None, None)
        >>> viewlets.sort([ ('zero', zero), ('one', one), ('two', two) ])
        [('zero', <Viewlet object at ...>),
        ('one', <Viewlet object at ...>),
        ('two', <Viewlet object at ...>)]
