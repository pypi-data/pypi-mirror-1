kuki.js - 1.4-alpha1 Released 2008-03-09

    - refactor the value provider registry to use
      a single registry in place of 3.
      This will enable to define value
      providers that recieve non-string parameters
      like a node selection.
      [ree]

    - Remove previously deprecated form() and
      currentForm() value providers from normal
      action parameters (remark: they should
      be used with kssSelector.)
      They now give a parsing error.

      [gotcha]

    - Fix multiple selection form fields marshalling on Safari 
      (fixes #22 in kssproject) and on IE.

      [gotcha]

    - Enhance javascript exception, they now properly show
      the place where the exception generated, and also the

      [jvloothuis, ree]

    - Allow multiple selectors separated with commas for a single
      set of property in a rule
      [gotcha, laz, jfroche]

    - Changed kukit payload to encode HTML content of CDATA.
      This was necessary because us a supposed bug in FF, that
      prevented us to use base2 (xpath selection did not work
      on inserted elements, due to namespace issues.)
      Get rid of forceToDom, make sure all plugins accept html
      parameters as strings.
      [ree, jvloothuis]
