kss.core - 1.2-rc1

    - Deprecated addClassName, removeClassName actions and
      commands in favour of addClass and removeClass.
      Deprecated "name" and "classname" parameter in addClass, 
      removeClass, toggleClass actions and commands in favour of 
      "value".
      [ree]

    - implement new packing directives and two disctint
      versions of the javascript (development and production),
      this is achieved from javascript with the ;;; marker
      Also add the @@kss_devel_mode/ui view for changing
      the development mode from the browser.
      [ree]

    - Add the passnode selector that can be used to access
      the value of a default parm passed programmatically
      from the event (via makeActionOper)
      [ree]

    - Add action moveNodeAsLastChild
      [ree]

    - Death to Azax (... long live KSS)!
      Removing last traces of the old name from the sources
      [gotcha]

    - Changed querying for css selectors to base2 instead of
      cssQuery. Base2 is supposed to be a lot faster than
      the old cssQuery. Usage is alternating, if base2 is
      present that one is used, otherwise it uses the old
      cssQuery code which stays the default.

    - Add moveNodeBefore action (presumably missing)
      [ree]

    - Refactor load event, separate iload and load events.
      The new event binder handles both events together. A
      new parameter, evt-iload-autodetect is introduced, if
      this is false we don't use detection but the iframe
      must cooperate on telling us wnen we are done.  There
      is deprecation warning issued for the load events, if
      bound on an iframe, in which case an iload event must
      be used.
      [ree]

    - refactor event binding to allow different iterators to bind
      events in a binder instance, matching the need of the events.
      [ree]
