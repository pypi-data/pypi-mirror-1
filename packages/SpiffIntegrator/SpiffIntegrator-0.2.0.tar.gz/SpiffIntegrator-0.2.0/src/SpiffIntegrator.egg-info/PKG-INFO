Description: 
        Spiff Integrator is a small but powerful package manager that was written
        for adding plugin support into applications. It handles packing/unpacking,
        installation/updates/removal, and dependency management and provides a bus
        over which plugins may communicate.
        It was designed to provide a clean API, high security and high scalability.
        
        For documentation please refer to the `README file`_ or the tests included
        with the package. You may also look at the `API documentation`_.
