Spiff Integrator
-----------------
This library is part of the Spiff platform.

Spiff Integrator is the package manager of the Spiff platform.
The library performs the following tasks:

   - Installing plugins.
   - Deleting plugins.
   - Ensuring that dependencies between plugins are consistent at
     any given time.
   - Loading packages when they are needed.
   - Provide a facility over which plugins can communicate.

permission restrictions to them. This functionality will only be added
at a later time, however.
