Description: ``met.py`` is a Python module that allows you to define a pair of
        multinomial distributions (conceptually 'control' and 'test' or
        'reference' and 'site' distributions) and then compute one- and
        two-sided p values to test whether the 'site' distribution is equivalent
        to the 'reference' distribution. The likelihood of all possible
        'reference' distributions can be evaluated and the distribution of *p*
        values can be expressed in terms of the likelihood of the observed
        'reference' distribution.
        
        The ``met`` module defines one class, one exception, and several
        functions.  The class (``Multinom``) defines objects that represent
        specific combinations of multinomial data for site and reference
        conditions.  Methods of ``Multinom`` objects allow one-sided and two-sided
        exact tests to be performed.  Attributes of ``Multinom`` objects allow
        access to additional information generated by the exact tests, such as
        the number of different rearrangements of site data that were found to
        be more extreme than the reference data.
        
        Functions in the ``met`` module allow *p* values to be calculated for a
        variety of reference probability distributions that might have produced
        the observed reference data, producing a likelihood estimate for each
        *p* value.
