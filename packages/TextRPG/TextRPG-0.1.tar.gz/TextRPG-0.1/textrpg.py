"""TextRPG - Simple TextRPG module built on top of the 1d6 RPG library.

Usage: 
    - ministory.py 
    Test the ministory (a testcase for the textrpg module)
    - textrpg.py 
    Start the internal test story of the textrpg. 

TODO: Lazy loading modules, to be able to print stuff at once without having to print before the imports.

Plans: 
    - Simple to use functions in easy to read scriptfiles in the style of the ministory file.
