Description: 
        Information: http://rpg-1d6.sf.net
        
        
        Usage:
        - ministory.py
        Test the ministory (a testcase for the textrpg module)
        - textrpg.py
        Start the internal test story of the textrpg.
        
        Plans:
        - Simple to use functions in easy to read scriptfiles in the style of the ministory file.
        - char.check() should take a skill name instead of a value. -> i.e.: char.skill_check("cooking", MW=9), MW optional.
        
        Ideas:
        - Lazy loading modules, to be able to print stuff at once without having to print before the imports.
        
        
        
        Changes:
        
        textrpg 0.2:
        
        - FIX: Installation required Changelog.txt which isn't distributed.
        
        textrpg 0.1:
        
        - Added give_exp() function for scripts which calls the experience "screen".
        - Renamed ews package to textrpg_1d6 to avoid clashes with possibly installed ews module -> useful while also working on the backend.
        - Fertigkeiten now get increased by related attributes. Which attribute is related must be declared explicitely.
        - Added fighting styles: defensive and attack head.
        - Show base TP in battle stats.
        - A bit more 'you did great' output if at least 9 battles were won and the character lost afterwards.
        - The player is prompted to decide on a battle strategy/style each round.
        - The experience can also be increased by simply saying char.exp = new_value. If the new value is lower than the current value, nothing happens, but it gives the return value False.
        - exp is now a property, and so it wil always be up to date.
        - added ministory scripting example.
        - simpler scripting added.
        - Prepared localization of most internal strings.
        - Text output and documentation update.
        - Ask whenever the round is for the player which action to take and many smaller changes (i.e.: tabs to spaces).
        - Added interface for different fighting styles and a hit treshold (below which the character evades the attack or the attack hits the shield).
        - Nicer Experience 'screen'.
        - Nicer battle output and output, when a skill got raised.
        - upgrade now returns what it did: (obj before, obj after).
        - Begun writing the TextRPG.
        
        - FIX: Damage for own attacks except the first wasn't printed.
        - FIX: empty attributes to attribute dict problems -> turned attributes into a property.
        - FIX: persistent game states didn't work due to a version management bug (workdir had not been changed everywhere).
        - FIX: corrected dieing.
        
        ews 0.1
        
        - created ews as rpg backend package.
