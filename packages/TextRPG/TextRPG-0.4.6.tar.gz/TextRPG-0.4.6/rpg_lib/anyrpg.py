"""AnyRPG - Basic functions and classes for simple RPG scripting modules.

It contains the basic functions any RPG scripting module which wants to be compatible with TextRPG stories needs to provide. 

TODO: Add doctests, since it begins to become more complex... 

Plans: 
    - Simple to use functions in easy to read scriptfiles in the style of the ministory file. 
    - char.compete(other, skill_name) -> See who wins and by how much. 

Ideas: 
    - Lazy loading modules, to be able to print stuff at once without having to print before the imports. 
    - Add getting experience for groups and show the chars together (only one experience header instead of one per char). 
    - Being able to press "pause" when using autoscrolling output. 


Basic design principles for the scripting language: 
    
    - The action is character centered wherever possible and useful. 
       -> char.say(text) instead of dialog(char, text)
    
    - Anything which affects only one character or any interaction between only a few characters which is initiated by one of them gets called from the character via char.action(). 
       -> char.compete_skill(char2, skill_name) instead of competition_skill(char1, char2, skill_name)
    
    - Anything which affects the whole scene, or a whole group of not necessarily interacting characters gets called as basic function via action() or as class in its own right via class.action(). 
       -> save([char1, char2]) instead of char1.save() char2.save()
    
    - The seperate class way should only be chosen, if the class can feel like a character in its own right and needs seperate states which may or may not be persistent over subsequent runs. 
       -> For example AI.choose_the_way(players_answer) or music.action()
    
    - Data should be stored inside the chars wherever possible. If a script gets started with the same character again, the situation should resemble the previous one as much as possible, except where dictated otherwise by the story. 
       -> char.save() instead of 'on quit' store_char_data(char) + 'on start' load_char_data(char)
    
    - Actions should be written as verb_noun or simply verb. 
       -> char.say() and char.compete_skill() instead of char.text() and char.skill_compete()
     
    - In the story function, an action is a parameter of the story. 
       -> story(switch_background_image="bg_image.png")
     

Design:
    - revert: story() is a function, but should be heavily overloaded, so it gets 
used for any kind of interacion with the setting. -> story(background="...", 
show_image="...", clear_images=True, background_musi="...", play_sound="...", ...)
      Reason: The story is the central background. 
      It creates the setting, just like an exposition. 
      So it can be treated in a special way. 
      This means: Doing it this way makes the scripts appear more natural (to me). 
      Also this allows story() to rearrange the order of passed arguments, if all get passed in one step -> a simpler way to say "new scene". 


This (and other) code can be found at U{http://freehg.org/ArneBab/textrpg}

Doctests: 
    >>> story_helper = Story()
    >>> story_helper.story("The flow changes", autoscroll=True)
    The flow changes
    >>> story_helper.story("", autoscroll=True)
    <BLANKLINE>

        - pull back (+9, no damage enemy)
        - try to escape. 
        - target specific body area for additional damage. 
        - Shield/evasion (treshold for the enemies diff, below which no hit was archieved).
    
    Ideas: 
        - Define a damage multiplier, which shows how effective the damage type is against the specific enemy -> do that in the char itself. 
        - Define the effectivity of the armor against the weapon. 
        - Get the treshold directly from the char.
