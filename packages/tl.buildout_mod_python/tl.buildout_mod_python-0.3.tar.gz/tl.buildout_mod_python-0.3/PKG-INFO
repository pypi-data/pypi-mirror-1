Description: ======================
        tl.buildout_mod_python
        ======================
        
        .. ATTENTION::
        This recipe has been deprecated. Its functionality is included in the
        `tl.buildout_apache`_ recipe from version 0.2 on. It may not be possible
        to use it together with version 0.3 or above of the Apache recipe.
        
        
        This is a `zc.buildout`_ recipe for setting up the `mod_python`_ module for
        the `Apache web server`_. It is designed to work together with the
        `tl.buildout_apache`_ recipes.
        
        Since the ``mod_python`` Python package needs to be available to the Python
        interpreter before it has a chance to modify the interpreter's module search
        path, this recipe writes a ``.pth`` file to Python's ``site-packages``
        directory. This means that the Python installation used must be writeable, and
        it should by all means be private to the buildout. You can include a
        custom-built Python in your buildout using some ``configure``/``make``/``make
        install`` recipe, or, as a light-weight alternative, a virtual python using
        the `tl.buildout_virtual_python`_ recipe. In any case, Python's C header files
        must be installed.
        
        This recipe appears to be reliable, but the feature set is basically
        determined by the author's immediate needs. Don't hesitate to send questions,
        bug reports, suggestions, or patches to <thomas@thomas-lotze.de>.
        
        
        Options
        =======
        
        A buildout part created by this recipe serves as a config part to be used in a
        ``tl.buildout_apache:root`` section. It adds configuration directives to load
        the mod_python shared module and configure the Python interpreters' module
        search path.
        
        None of the options described below are required: they either have sensible
        defaults or are computed by the recipe. You may override any of them.
        
        Configuration options:
        :url:
        Where to get the source distribution.
        
        :md5sum:
        MD5 checksum of the source distribution.
        
        :extra-options:
        Extra configure options, appended to the ``./configure`` command line.
        
        :extra-vars:
        Extra environment variables for ``./configure``, ``make``, and ``make
        install`` calls.
        
        ..
        
        :httpd:
        The name of a buildout section for an httpd installation, defaults to
        "httpd". This can either be a part that uses the
        ``tl.buildout_apache:root`` recipe, or a section that describes a
        system-wide installation. It must export the "apxs-path" option.
        
        :python:
        The name of a buildout section for a Python installation, defaults to
        the Python section used by the "buildout" part. It must export the
        "executable" option.
        
        ..
        
        :eggs:
        Specifications of eggs to be available on mod_python's default Python
        path.
        
        :find-links:
        See the zc.recipe.egg documentation.
        
        :index:
        See the zc.recipe.egg documentation.
        
        :extra-paths:
        Non-egg paths to be included in mod_python's default Python path.
        
        ..
        
        :config-parts:
        Names of buildout sections with further configuration. See the
        ``tl.buildout_apache:root`` recipe.
        
        Exported options:
        :so-path:
        Absolute file system path to the ``mod_python.so`` shared module.
        
        :lib-dir:
        Absolute file system path to the Python library directory that
        contains the ``mod_python`` package.
        
        :path-file:
        The path to a file that contains the paths to the configured eggs and
        all of the configured extra paths, one per line.
        
        :extra-env:
        A specification for httpd's PATH so the correct Python executable will
        be used.
        
        :extra-config:
        A piece of Apache server configuration that loads the mod_python
        shared module and sets mod_python's default Python path.
