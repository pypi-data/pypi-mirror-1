Changes between versions
========================

0.3
---

Organization:
  - deprecated project since its functionality will be included in
    tl.buildout_apache 0.2.
  - moved project in Subversion to
    <https://svn.thomas-lotze.de/repos/public/tl.buildout_apache/>


0.2
---

Bug fixes:
  - added zc.recipe.egg to the dependencies

  - actually made the recipe work without mod_python accidentally being
    installed to the system Python (blush): the mod_python Python package
    needs to go into the Python installation; adding its parent dir to the
    PythonPath makes the package available too late

  - symlink the Python executable mod_python was built against and installed
    relative to, and put it on Apache's $PATH through a config-part variable;
    mod_python would call the system Python otherwise

  - removed an ugly hack: egg locations and extra paths are now stored in and
    read from a file instead of symlinking the hell out of it

  - improved the dependency signature for detecting changes to httpd or Python

Organization:
  - set up a zc.buildout environment for a development installation


0.1.2
-----

Bug fixes:
  - put all eggs in the working set on the Python path, not only those
    installed explicitly
