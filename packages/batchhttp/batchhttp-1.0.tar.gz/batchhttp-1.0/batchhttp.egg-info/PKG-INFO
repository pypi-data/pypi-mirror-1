Description: batchhttp provides parallel fetching of HTTP resources through MIME multipart
        encoding.
        
        This package's `BatchClient` applies standard MIME multipart encoding to HTTP
        messages, providing a standards-conservant technique for making parallelizable
        HTTP requests over a single proxy connection.
        
        To make a batch request, open a new request on a `BatchClient` instance and
        add your subrequests, along with callbacks that will receive the subresponses.
        Once all parallelized requests are added, complete the request; the request is
        made and the batched subresponses are provided to your callbacks.
