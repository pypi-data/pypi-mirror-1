Description: Python bindings for Light Media Scanner.
        
        Lightweight media scanner meant to be used in not-so-powerful devices,
        like embedded systems or old machines.
        
        Provides an optimized way to recursively scan directories, handling
        the parser in a child process, avoiding breaks of the main process
        when parsers break (quite common with such bad libs and tags). One can
        opt to use the single process version, but be aware that if something
        bad happens during parsing, your application will suffer.
        
        Parsers are plugins in the form of shared objects, so it's easy to add
        new without having to recompiling the scanner.
        
        The scanner will use SQLite3 to store file-mtime association, avoiding
        parsing files that are already up-to-date. This SQLite connection and
        the file id within the master table 'files' are handled to plugins for
        relationship with other tables.
