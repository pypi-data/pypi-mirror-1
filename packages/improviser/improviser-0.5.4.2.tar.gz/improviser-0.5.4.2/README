  Automatic music generation program. 

  http://pypi.python.org/pypi/improviser/

================================================================================

  Requirements:

    * A Python runtime - http://www.python.org
    * The Python mingus library - http://mingus.googlecode.com/
    * Fluidsynth - http://www.fluidsynth.org/
    * A SF2 SoundFont. You can find those using Google. I've used the Chorium
      soundfont found on http://www.hammersound.net (go to Sounds -> Soundfont 
      Library -> Collections)

  Optional:
 
    * Pygame for the Visualizations - http://www.pygame.org/

================================================================================

  Installation: 

	* Install the required programs and libraries.
	* Run `python setup.py install`

================================================================================

  To start a simulation, you must first have a FluidSynth server listening at 
  port 9800. To do this run:

	fluidsynth -is $SOUNDFONT

  Where $SOUNDFONT is the location of your SF2 file. 
  FluidSynth has many more interesting options like jack support, etc. You 
  should check out the documentation. I believe there also is a GUI for 
  Fluidsynth called QSynth, but I haven't tried that.

  Once you have the MIDI synthesizer running, you can enter the improviser 
  directory and start:

	Improviser.py	

  There will later be an option in Improviser.py to choose different front-ends 
  so this separate program will be redundant, but for now you can also use:
 
        pygame-Improviser.py

  So you'll have a little visualization while the PC is jamming away.

    If you'd like to get in touch to ask a question or submit a patch, 
    you should contact the mingus' google group at

	http://groups.google.com/group/mingus-python

    since this application hasn't got its own page yet.
