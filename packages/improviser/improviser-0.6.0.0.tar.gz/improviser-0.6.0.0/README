  Hi!

  This is the automatic music generation program imaginatively called:
  'Improviser'. It can play and generate music in real-time and save the 
  result as a MIDI file as well. 

  http://pypi.python.org/pypi/improviser/

================================================================================

  Requirements:

    * A Python runtime - http://www.python.org
    * The Python mingus library - http://mingus.googlecode.com/
    * Fluidsynth - http://www.fluidsynth.org/
    * A SF2 SoundFont. You can find those using Google. I've used the Chorium
      soundfont found on http://www.hammersound.net (go to Sounds -> Soundfont 
      Library -> Collections)

  Optional:
 
    * Pygame for the Visualizations - http://www.pygame.org/

================================================================================

  Installation: 

	* Install the required programs and libraries.
	* Run `python setup.py install`

================================================================================

  To start a real-time simulation, run:

	Improviser.py -e jazz --sf2 soundfont.sf2

  This uses the jazz ensemble to play the default progressions with the soundfont
  you downloaded from internet. You can use
  the --list or -l switch to list progressions, ensembles, blocks, etc.
  For instance:

	Improviser.py -le

  Gives you a list of the available ensembles.

  If you want to have a little visualization while the PC is jamming away,
  use the --frontend switch:

	Improviser.py --frontend mixed

  To see more options use the --help switch.

================================================================================

  Contact:

    If you'd like to get in touch to ask a question or submit a patch, 
    you should contact the mingus' google group at

	http://groups.google.com/group/mingus-python

    since this application hasn't got its own page yet, but the author 
    is the same (hi there!).
