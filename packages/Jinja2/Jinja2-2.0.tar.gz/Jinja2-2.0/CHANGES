Jinja2 Changelog
===============

Version 2.0
-----------
(codename jinjavitus, released on July 17th 2008)

- the subscribing of objects (looking up attributes and items) changed from
  slightly.  It's now possible to give attributes or items a higher priority
  by either using dot-notation lookup or the bracket syntax.  This also
  changed the AST slightly.  `Subscript` is gone and was replaced with
  :class:`~jinja2.nodes.Getitem` and :class:`~jinja2.nodes.Getattr`.

  For more information see :ref:`the implementation details <notes-on-subscriptions>`.

- added support for preprocessing and token stream filtering for extensions.
  This would allow extensions to allow simplified gettext calls in template
  data and something similar.

- added :meth:`jinja2.environment.TemplateStream.dump`.

- added missing support for implicit string literal concatenation.
  ``{{ "foo" "bar" }}`` is equivalent to ``{{ "foobar" }}``

- `else` is optional for conditional expressions.  If not given it evaluates
  to `false`.

- improved error reporting for undefined values by providing a position.

- `filesizeformat` filter uses decimal prefixes now per default and can be
  set to binary mode with the second parameter.

- fixed bug in finalizer
