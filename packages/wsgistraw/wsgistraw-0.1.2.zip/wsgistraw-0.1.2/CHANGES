0.1.2, 2007-09-21
-----------------

A bugfix release.

* Fixed a bug in ``app_proxy`` with extending an iterable with the results of ``write()``

0.1.1, 2007-08-16
-----------------

Added ``app_proxy``, fixed a couple of inconsistencies with PEP 333.

* Added public ``app_proxy`` class (former ``_app_proxy``, thanks to Ian Bicking)
* If an app uses ``write()`` then ``app_proxy`` invokes ``response.close()`` after iterating over it
* If an app hasn't invoked ``start_resposnse()`` before returning then ``app_proxy`` forces this invocation by calling ``response.next()``
