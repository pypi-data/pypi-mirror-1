NAME
    wsgistraw - decorators for WSGI without start_response and write

DESCRIPTION
    wsgistraw is a tiny Python library that simplifies coding WSGI applications
    and middleware by removing start_response and write from signatures of
    functions. This leads to a signature like:

    def app(environ):
        return "200 OK", [("Content-Type", "text/plain")], ["Hello World!"]

    That is, return a three-tuple of (status, headers, response).

CLASSES
    app_proxy
        Replaces a WSGI application callable on the caller side, returns the
        application with the simplified signature.

FUNCTIONS
    app(app)
        Decorates WSGI application callables (both functions and methods).

    mid_factory(mid_factory)
        Decorates WSGI middleware factories, i. e. callables that accept a WSGI
        application as their first positional parameter and return a middleware
        callable.
