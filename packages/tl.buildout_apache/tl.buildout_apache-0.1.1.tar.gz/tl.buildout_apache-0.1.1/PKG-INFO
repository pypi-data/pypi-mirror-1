Description: ==================
        tl.buildout_apache
        ==================
        
        
        This is a collection of `zc.buildout`_ recipes for setting up an `Apache web
        server`_ environment. It provides the following entry points:
        
        :httpd:
        Builds the Apache HTTP server software from source.
        
        :root:
        Configures an Apache server root (an instance in Zope speak).
        
        These recipes appear to be reliable, but the feature set is basically
        determined by the author's immediate needs. Don't hesitate to send questions,
        bug reports, suggestions, or patches to <thomas@thomas-lotze.de>.
        
        
        The build recipe: ``tl.buildout_apache:httpd``
        ==============================================
        
        None of the options described below are required: they either have sensible
        defaults or are computed by the recipe. You may override any of them.
        
        Configuration options:
        :url:
        Where to get the source distribution.
        
        :md5sum:
        MD5 checksum of the source distribution.
        
        :extra-options:
        Extra configure options, appended to the ``./configure`` command line.
        
        :extra-vars:
        Extra environment variables for ``./configure``, ``make``, and ``make
        install`` calls.
        
        Exported options:
        :httpd-path:
        Absolute file system path to the ``httpd`` executable.
        
        :envvars-path:
        Absolute file system path to the ``envvars`` script.

        :module-dir:
        Absolute file system path to the shared modules directory.

        :builtin-modules:
        Space-separated list of all modules compiled into the httpd
        executable. Names are stripped of any ``mod_``, ``_module`` , and
        ``.so`` bits.
        
        
        The server root recipe: ``tl.buildout_apache:root``
        ===================================================
        
        An Apache server process configured with this recipe will run the "prefork"
        multi-processing module.
