Installing python-discount
==========================

Currently, python-discount compiles the Discount C library as a
shared object, which is bundled and installed a long with the Python
source.

This is mainly for convenience but also because, currently, the
Discount source compiles a static library file, and as far as I know,
ctypes can only load dynamic libraries.

If you have ways to improve the setup.py script, let me know!

To install the package, simply run:

    python setup.py install

The setup script will download, unpack and configure the Discount
source tarball.  Alternatively, you can point the build_ext
command to a source directory:

    python setup.py build_ext --discount-source-path=/path/to/discount
    python setup.py install

Please report any bugs with the setup.py script to the GitHub
project page, http://github.com/trapeze/python-discount/issues
