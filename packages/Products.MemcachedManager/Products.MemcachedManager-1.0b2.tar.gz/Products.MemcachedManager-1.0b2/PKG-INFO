Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        MemcachedManager is a cache similar to RAMCacheManager, using memcached for
        storage.
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        `memcached`_
        
        This needs to be set up on a server Zope can connect to. You provide the
        IP address in the MemcachedManager settings screen.
        
        
        `cmemcache`_
        
        Install this in site packages (the regular "setup.py install") to enable
        python to talk to memcached. A note of caution: while cmemcache is faster
        it is also less stable.
        
        or...
        
        `python-memcached`_
        
        Install this in site packages (the regular ``setup.py install``) to enable
        python to talk to memcached.
