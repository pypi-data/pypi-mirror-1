Introduction
------------

Welcome to PyMultimethods - the multimethods library for python, version 0.2.  This release may be considered beta.  The API should remain backwards-compatible, but this is not an absolute guarantee.

PyMultimethods major goals are to be robust and pythonic.  To this end (being pythonic), PyMultimethods provides a decorator interface for the creation of multimethods.

Installation
------------

PyMultimethods makes use of the distutil package for installation.  To install from source, simply run

    python setup.py install

from the source root directory.
