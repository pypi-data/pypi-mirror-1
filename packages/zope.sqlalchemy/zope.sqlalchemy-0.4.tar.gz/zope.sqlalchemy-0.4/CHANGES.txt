Changes
=======

0.4 (2009-01-20)
----------------

Bugs fixed:

* Only raise errors in tpc_abort if we have committed.

* Remove the session id from the SESSION_STATE just before we de-reference the
  session (i.e. all work is already successfuly completed). This fixes cases
  where the transaction commit failed but SESSION_STATE was already cleared.  In
  those cases, the transaction was wedeged as abort would always error.  This
  happened on PostgreSQL where invalid SQL was used and the error caught.

* Call session.flush() unconditionally in tpc_begin.

* Change error message on session.commit() to be friendlier to non zope users.

Feature changes:

* Support for bulk update and delete with SQLAlchemy 0.5.1

0.3 (2008-07-29)
----------------

Bugs fixed:

* New objects added to a session did not cause a transaction join, so were not
  committed at the end of the transaction unless the database was accessed.
  SQLAlchemy 0.4.7 or 0.5beta3 now required.

Feature changes:

* For correctness and consistency with ZODB, renamed the function 'invalidate' 
  to 'mark_changed' and the status 'invalidated' to 'changed'.

0.2 (2008-06-28)
----------------

Feature changes:

* Updated to support SQLAlchemy 0.5. (0.4.6 is still supported).

0.1 (2008-05-15)
----------------

* Initial public release.
