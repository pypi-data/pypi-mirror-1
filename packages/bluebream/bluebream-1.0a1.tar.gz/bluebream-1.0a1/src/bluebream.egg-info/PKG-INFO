        BlueBream
        *********
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        `BlueBream <http://bluebream.zope.org>`_ is a web framework written
        in Python programming language.  BlueBream is a free/open source
        software, owned by the `Zope Foundation
        <http://foundation.zope.org>`_, licensed under the `Zope Public
        License <http://foundation.zope.org/agreements/ZPL_2.1.pdf>`_ (BSD
        like, GPL compatible license).  BlueBream was previously known as
        **Zope 3**.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        A few of the features which distinguish BlueBream among Python web
        frameworks.
        
        - BlueBream is built on top of the `Zope Tool Kit
        <http://docs.zope.org/zopetoolkit>`_ (ZTK), a distillation of
        decades of experience in meeting demanding requirements for stable,
        scalable software.
        
        - BlueBream leverages the power of `Buildout
        <http://www.buildout.org>`_ a build system written in Python.
        
        - BlueBream uses the `ZODB <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ZODB3>`_
        transactional object database, providing extremely powerful and
        easy to use persistence.
        
        - BlueBream uses `ZCML
        <http://www.muthukadan.net/docs/zca.html#zcml>`_, an XML based
        configuration language for registering components, providing
        limitless flexibility. If you don't need the power of ZCML and the
        complexity it adds, try `Grok <http://grok.zope.org>`_, which adds
        a layer replacing the declarative configuration of ZCML with
        conventions and declarations in standard Python.
        
        - BlueBream features the `Zope Component Architecture
        <http://muthukadan.net/docs/zca.html>` (ZCA) which implements
        *Separation of concerns* to create highly cohesive reusable
        components (zope.component).
        
        - BlueBream supports `WSGI <http://www.wsgi.org/wsgi>`_ using `Paste
        <http://pythonpaste.org>`_, `PasteScript
        <http://pythonpaste.org/script>`, and `PasteDeploy
        <http://pythonpaste.org/deploy>`.
        
        - BlueBream includes a number of compenents which provide well tested
        implementation of common requirements. A few are of these are:
        
        - zope.publisher_ publishes Python objects on the web, it is geared
        towards `WSGI <http://www.wsgi.org/wsgi>` compatibility
        
        - zope.security_ provides a generic mechanism supporting pluggable
        security policies
        
        - zope.testing_ and zope.testbrowser_ offer unit and functional testing
        frameworks
        
        - zope.pagetemplate_ is an XHTML-compliant templating language
        
        - zope.schema_ and zope.formlib_ provide a schema engine and
        automatic form generation machinery

        Installation
        ------------
        
        If you have installed `setuptools
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_ or `distribute
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute>`_ an ``easy_install``
        command will be available.  Then, you can install BlueBream using
        ``easy_install`` command like this::
        
        $ easy_install bluebream
        
        Internet access to `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_ is required
        to perform installation of BlueBream.
        
        Once BlueBream is installed, run ``paster`` command to create the
        project directory.  The ``create`` sub-command provided by ``paster``
        will show a wizard to create the project directory.
        
        ::
        
        $ paster create -t bluebream
        
        You need to provide the project name and namespace package name.  The
        project name will be used as the egg name.
        
        The project name can be give given as a command line argument::
        
        $ paster create -t bluebream sampleproject
        
        The name of namespace package also can be given from the command line::
        
        $ paster create -t bluebream sampleproject namespace_package=mycompany
        
        The other variables which can be given from command line are:
        
        - ``interpreter`` -- Name of custom Python interpreter
        
        - version: Version (like 0.1)
        
        - description: One-line description of the package
        
        - long_description: Multi-line description (in reST)
        
        - keywords: Space-separated keywords/tags
        
        - author: Author name
        
        - author_email: Author email
        
        - url: URL of homepage
        
        - license_name: License name
        
        - zip_safe: ``True``, if the package can be distributed as a .zip
        file othewise ``False``.
        
        If you are in a hurry, you can simply press *Enter/Return* key and
        change the values later.  But it would be a good idea, if you provide
        good name for your project.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        The generated package is bundled with Buildout configuration and the
        Buildout bootstrap script (``bootstrap.py``).  First you need to
        bootstrap the buildout itself::
        
        $ cd sampleproject
        $ python2.6 bootstrap.py
        
        The bootstrap script will install ``zc.buildout`` and ``setuptools``
        package.  Also, it will create the basic directory structure.  Next
        step is building the application.  To build the application, run the
        buildout::
        
        $ ./bin/buidout
        
        The buildout script will download all dependencies and setup the
        environment to run your application.
        
        To run test cases::
        
        $ ./bin/test
        
        To get the debug shell::
        
        $ ./bin/paster shell debug.ini
        
        To run the server::
        
        $ ./bin/paster serve debug.ini
        
        Now you can access the main page from: http://localhost:8080
        
        You can continue reading about BlueBream from the `documentation site
        <http://bluebream.zope.org>`_.
