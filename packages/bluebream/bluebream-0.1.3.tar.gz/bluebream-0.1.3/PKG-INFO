        packages which was part of "Zope 3".
        
        2. Runnable Buildout
        
        3. Functional testing enabled by default using z3c.testsetup
        
        4. Use PasteDeploy

        Installation
        ------------
        
        To create a new project, first you need to install BlueBream::
        
        $ easy_install bluebream
        
        .. note::
        
        Access to `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org>`_ is required to perform
        the installation and bootstrapping process.
        
        Once BlueBream is installed, run ``paster`` command to create the
        project directory.  The ``create`` sub-command provided by ``paster``
        will show a wizard to create the project directory.
        
        ::
        
        $ paster create -t bluebream
        
        You need to provide the project name and namespace package name.  The
        project name will be used as the egg name.
        
        The project name can be give given as a command line argument::
        
        $ paster create -t bluebream sampleproject
        
        The name of namespace package also can be given from the command line::
        
        $ paster create -t bluebream sampleproject namespace_package=mycompany
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        The generated package include Buildout's bootstrap.py script and
        configuration file.  First you need to bootstrap the buildout::
        
        $ cd sampleproject
        $ python2.6 bootstrap.py
        
        After bootstrap, run the buildout::
        
        $ ./bin/buidout
        
        To run test cases::
        
        $ ./bin/test
        
        To run the server::
        
        $ ./bin/paster serve debug.ini
        
        For testing purpose, you can access the "hello" view registered here:
        http://localhost:8080/@hello
