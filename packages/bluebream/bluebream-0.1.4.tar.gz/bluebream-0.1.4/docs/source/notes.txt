Technical Decisions
-------------------

- BlueBream should be called as a "web framework".

- The only public API exposed by "bluebream - the package"
  is an entry point::

    "paste.paster_create_template":
        ["bluebream = bluebream.template:BlueBream"]

  The implementation of "bluebream" template is defined in
  "bluebream.template.BlueBream".  The template implementation
  location could be changed if required later.  This leaves us an
  option to change "bluebream" as a namespace package if required.

- All the framework code will be using "zope" or "zope.app" namespace
  packages.

- "bluebream" the package mainly consists

   - documentation

   - compatibility test suite

   - project template

   May be documentation and compatibility test suite could be
   separated out to separate locations/packages later.

- BlueBream 1.0 should provide an upgradation path from Zope 3.4 ZTK
