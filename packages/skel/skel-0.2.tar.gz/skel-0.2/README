= skel =

Produce a set of files and directories based on a "template" set of 
files and directories and a dict of "vars". Replace variables in file 
and directory names as well as file contents. Comes with a nice (I 
think) command line interface but is also a utility for building 
frameworks.

By default the Builder class catches x_foo_x in a directory or file name 
in the template and replaces it with the value of builder.dct['foo'] (if 
found). For file contents string.Template's safe_substitute. 

See docstrings of skel module for details.
