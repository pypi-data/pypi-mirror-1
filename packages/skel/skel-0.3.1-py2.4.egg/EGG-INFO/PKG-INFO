Description: Produce a set of files and directories based on a "template"
        set of files and directories and a some data (usually a dict of
        "vars". Replace variables in file and directory names as well as
        file contents. Comes with a nice (I think) command line interface
        but is also a utility for building frameworks and such. Supports
        pluggable "filters" so you could use Kid or Cheetah or probably
        any other templating language that you need.
