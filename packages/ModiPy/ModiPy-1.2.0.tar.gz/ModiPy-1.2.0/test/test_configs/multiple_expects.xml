<!-- A change that just looks for a bunch of strings, in order
     in the output datastream. All of them need to match, in
     order, for the change to succeed.
     This tests the data buffering code to make sure it's not
     too greedy, and doesn't muck up the stack push/pop style
     operations that are done with self.databuf in the
     ExpectSet.
