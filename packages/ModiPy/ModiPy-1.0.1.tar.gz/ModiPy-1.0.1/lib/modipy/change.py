"""
A changeset is a sequence of changes that can be applied to a managed element.
A changeset will move the element from one state, A, to a destination state, B.
A changeset may contain other changesets. These changesets will be implemented
in a specific order.
The successful implementation of a changeset must be testable.
If the test fails, implementation of the changeset has failed, and a backout can
be executed.
A changeset contains the necessary backouts.

If a sub-changeset fails implementation, the containing changeset also fails.

Imagine the following changeset:

useradd justin

This adds a user to the system. If something goes wrong, how do we back out? 
Default backout behaviour is to alert a human that something went wrong.

Backout may depend on the exact failure. The 'did it work' test should permit
selecting from a list of possible backout procedures, depending on the failure
that was detected.

This example would be a "Add User" changeset, and could be different on different
destination systems.

Note that a "Remove User" changeset would be different from the backout procedure
for a failed "Add User" changeset.

For a changeset that runs a sequence of commands (a CommandChangeset, perhaps?),
the default behaviour should be to detect if an individual command in the sequence
failed, and report the error to the backout method detection code. This will
provide the most generic way of testing for failure without having to run a mini-audit
after each command is executed. However, if such paranoid auditing is required, you
could implement the changeset as a series of changesets, rather than a single,
multi-command changeset. This would provide much finer grained error detection and
possible correction capabilities.

A changeset is a set of changes to be applied to a set of devices.
A change can be applied to multiple devices, eg: loading the same configuration file onto all 70 hosts.
Does the 'load configuration file to host list' change happen all at once, or as part of a sequence
of changes? How do the changes inter-relate? Contrast "Change all 70 hosts, then do the next thing", to
"Change the first host, then do this other thing, then change the next host".

A Change is the minimum transaction size. This is the smallest element that can be applied,
or backed out. So, to implement the above scenarios, you could:

- Define a Change that should be applied to a device list. The provisioning method may be different
  (ssh vs rsh) but only to a certain degree. A ZAPI commandset is fundamentally different to an ssh/rsh
  commandset, for example.
- Define a Change that should be applied to a device list of length 1.
- Define the order that changes should occur in.

So.. first we define a list of devices and their attributes (ssh key locations, etc). This would be
a single, global area for all devices/entities under change management.

Then, we define a changeset, which is a list of changes. Each change defines the device(s) it applies to,
and how to apply the change to it.
