Version 0.3.4 - 10 Sep 2008, by Per Øyvind Karlsen <peroyvind@mandriva.org>

- Add portability fixes for BSD. (from Anders F. Björklund)

Version 0.3.3 - 10 Sep 2008, by Per Øyvind Karlsen <peroyvind@mandriva.org>

- Rename python module name from 'liblzma' to 'lzma' as giving the module same
  name as the library would result in problems if the library were to be found
  in $PWD or $PYTHONPATH.
  Rationale behind module being named PylibLZMA and not PyLZMA is due to a
  different PyLZMA already exists, it's python module name is 'pylzma',
  so 'lzma' is available. :)
- fix code formatting that was quite messed up due to mixed usage of tab
  expansion and various tab length.
- clean out compiler flag craziness
