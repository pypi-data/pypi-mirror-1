Version 0.4.0 - 11 Sep 2008, by Per Øyvind Karlsen <peroyvind@mandriva.org>

- Add liblzma_file.[ch] implementing lzma_FILE*. (code much based on RPM's
  lzdio.c)
- renamed functions, classes, variables from liblzma* to lzma*.
- Implement LZMAFile object. (as with much of the existing code, most of the
  code is derived from Gustavo Niemeyer's bz2.c and adapted to lzma)
- Repository has now been migrated from git to bzr and is now hosted and
  publically available at http://launchpad.net/pyliblzma.

Version 0.3.4 - 10 Sep 2008, by Per Øyvind Karlsen <peroyvind@mandriva.org>

- Add portability fixes for BSD. (from Anders F. Björklund)

Version 0.3.3 - 10 Sep 2008, by Per Øyvind Karlsen <peroyvind@mandriva.org>

- Rename python module name from 'liblzma' to 'lzma' as giving the module same
  name as the library would result in problems if the library were to be found
  in $PWD or $PYTHONPATH.
  Rationale behind module being named PylibLZMA and not PyLZMA is due to a
  different PyLZMA already exists, it's python module name is 'pylzma',
  so 'lzma' is available. :)
- fix code formatting that was quite messed up due to mixed usage of tab
  expansion and various tab length.
- clean out compiler flag craziness.
