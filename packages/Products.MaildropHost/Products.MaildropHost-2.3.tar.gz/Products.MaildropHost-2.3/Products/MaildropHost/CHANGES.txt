MaildropHost change log
=======================

2.3 (2009-10-09)
----------------

- Feature: Added a method for extending the list of configuration
  file paths programatically.

2.2 (2009-05-29)
----------------

- Bug: If a configuration file path has been set, but the file is 
  removed later, Zope would no longer start up as the 
  MaildropHost code attempts to load the file but fails. Now it
  will fall back to the default file path in this case.

- Bug: Replace file paths pointing to config.py as opposed to 
  the new config in stop_maildrop and testing/start_maildrop
  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00641)

- Remove a few extraneous log file close calls in maildrop.py
  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00636)

- fix testing to detect Zope trunk


2.1 (2008-11-03)
----------------

- compatibility work for Zope 2.11


2.0 (2008-11-01)
----------------

- Switch to releasing MaildropHost as egg

- clean up Python module preambles based on the standard set by Zope
  itself.

- clean up Subversion keyword tagging to use the Id tag all over

- major test refactoring and simplifications

- The MaildropHost class is now marked to implement IMailHost, just
  like the standard Zope 2 MailHost.

- The configuration file for each MaildropHost instance can now be selected 
  in the ZMI on the 'Edit' tab. By default, the dropdown will show the file
  'config' in the MaildropHost directory. The site administrator can add
  more paths using the Zope instance configuration file zope.conf. Please 
  see README.txt to find out how.

- cleaned up the help system content and use the name "MaildropHost" as 
  opposed to "Maildrop Host" wherever possible.
