Installation requirements
=========================

- a working SMTP server

- Zope 2.8.0 or higher

- A UNIX operating system to run the maildrop daemon. It does not work
  on Windows.


Installation
============

If you do not install MaildropHost as an egg, you can manually copy the 
MaildropHost folder from Products.MaildropHost/Products/MaildropHost
into a place where Zope can find it, like the "Products" directory:

 $ cp -r Products.MaildropHost/Products/MaildropHost <zope>/lib/python/Products/

Do not forget to restart Zope afterwards.

You will find a file named "config" in the MaildropHost folder. 
This file contains all site-specific settings and you must
edit it to suit your needs. IMPORTANT: Since this file is also
sourced by a few shell scripts you must not put any whitespace
around equal (=) signs!

Startup scripts for the standalone maildrop daemon, which processes
mail items generated by the MaildropHost Zope product, can be found
inside the <MaildropHost>/maildrop/bin-folder. What these scripts
do and how to use them is described in a separate README inside that
folder.


Upgrade notes
=============

- 1.21 to 1.22: The configuration file parsing mechanism changed, it's no
  longer a Python import. The code will now look for a file named `config`
  instead of `config.py`. However, the file contents have not changed, your
  existing MaildropHost configuration file contents remain valid.
