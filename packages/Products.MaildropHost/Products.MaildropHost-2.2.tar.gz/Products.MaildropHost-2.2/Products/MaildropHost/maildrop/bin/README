Start/Stop scripts for the standalone maildrop daemon
=====================================================

This README explains what the files in this folder do and how to use
them.  All these scripts depend on you having edited the config file
in the toplevel MaildropHost folder to reflect your
environment. 

Please note: Some of them require additional editing before use! If you
use several maildrop daemons with different configurations, make sure 
to adjust the configuration file path for each daemon startup script.

start_maildrop

  Basic start script to start up the maildrop daemon. All configuration
  is taken from the config file, no additional editing needed.

stop_maildrop

  Basic stop script to stop the maildrop daemon. No additional editing
  needed.

start_maildrop.bat

  Startup script suitable for Windows. Its correctness or working order
  cannot be guaranteed since I do not use Windows.

maildrop-redhat

  Combined start/stop script that interoperates with the RedHat way of
  controlling services and daemons. This script *needs editing* at the 
  top so it knows where to locate the maildrop files when run at 
  startup and it knows what user account to run under.

  Edit the MAILDROP_USER and SOFTWARE_HOME values at the top of the script.
  Then all you need to do is copy or link it into /etc/rc.d/init.d and 
  ensure that it gets run on system start/system shutdown by using 
  the chkconfig utility, like so::

    $ /sbin/chkconfig --add maildrop-redhat

  This will take care of all activation. You can, as root, use this::

    $ /sbin/service maildrop-redhat {start|stop|restart}

  to control the service.

maildrop-suse

  Combined start/stop script that interoperates with the SuSE way of
  controlling services and daemons. This script *needs editing* at the 
  top so it knows where to locate the maildrop files when run at 
  startup and it knows what user account to run under.

  Edit the MAILDROP_USER and SOFTWARE_HOME values at the top of the script.
  Then all you need to do is copy or link it into /etc/rc.d and 
  ensure that it gets run on system start/system shutdown by using 
  the chkconfig utility, like so::

    $ /sbin/chkconfig --add maildrop-suse

  This will take care of all activation. You can, as root, use this::

    $ /etc/rc.d/maildrop-suse {start|stop|restart}

  to control the service.
