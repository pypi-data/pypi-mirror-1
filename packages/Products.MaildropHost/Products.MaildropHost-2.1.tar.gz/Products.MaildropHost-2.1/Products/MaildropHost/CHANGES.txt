MaildropHost change log
=======================

2.1 (2008-11-03)
----------------

- compatibility work for Zope 2.11


2.0 (2008-11-01)
----------------

- Switch to releasing MaildropHost as egg

- clean up Python module preambles based on the standard set by Zope
  itself.

- clean up Subversion keyword tagging to use the Id tag all over

- major test refactoring and simplifications

- The MaildropHost class is now marked to implement IMailHost, just
  like the standard Zope 2 MailHost.

- The configuration file for each MaildropHost instance can now be selected 
  in the ZMI on the 'Edit' tab. By default, the dropdown will show the file
  'config' in the MaildropHost directory. The site administrator can add
  more paths using the Zope instance configuration file zope.conf. Please 
  see README.txt to find out how.

- cleaned up the help system content and use the name "MaildropHost" as 
  opposed to "Maildrop Host" wherever possible.
