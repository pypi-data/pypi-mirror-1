To install pyhistorian you just need to have setuptools installed (it's a dependency).
But to run all tests succesfully you will need should-dsl, and it can be found at http://github.com/hugobr/should-dsl

There is just a little step to install pyhistorian, and it is:
$ python setup.py install # maybe you must be root

Or if you want to use easy_install and leave it install all dependencies to you, just type:
$ easy_install pyhistorian # maybe you must be root


Now you can use pyhistorian!

Enjoy it!
