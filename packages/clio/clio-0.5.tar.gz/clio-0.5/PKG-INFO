Description: Clio
        ****
        
        Clio is a library based on SQLAlchemy that can be used to add a
        publication workflow and archiving system to a database.
        
        The documentation is available at http://packages.python.org/clio/
        
        Note that currently MySQL is a requirement (for running the tests, and
        for the sequence support). This requirement is not a core requirement
        of Clio however, and the main Clio codebase does not depend on it, so
        it is expected to go away.
