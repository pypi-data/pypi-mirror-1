Description: Clio
        ****
        
        Clio is a library based on SQLAlchemy that can be used to add a
        publication workflow and archiving system to a database.
        
        The documentation is available at http://packages.python.org/clio/
        
        Note that currently MySQL is a requirement (for running the tests, and
        for the sequence support). This requirement is not a core requirement
        of Clio however, and the main Clio codebase does not depend on it, so
        it is expected to go away.
        
        CHANGES
        *******
        
        0.6 (2010-02-10)
        ================
        
        - userid tracking for workflow events.
        
        - change the way timestamps are recorded so that queries for older
        published items can more easily be constructed. This breaks existing
        databases. We assume nobody but the author is using Clio yet.
        
        - stop using pysqlite in the tests; the tests now depend on MySQL.
        
        - Introduce ACTUAL_STATUSES. This is what is present in the edit UI,
        except those things that were deleted. This can be handy in queries.
        
        0.5 (2009-11-16)
        ================
        
        - Initial public release.
