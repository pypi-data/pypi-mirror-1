0.6.3 (2010-02-12)
==================

- Another bugfix with revert logic. Allow reverting already published
  objects, as they may have relations that need to be reverted. Don't
  raise an error when trying to revert an archived object, instead
  just don't do anything.

0.6.2 (2010-02-12)
==================

- Fixed a bug in revert logic. Reversion of edited records should now
  work better when there are relations.

0.6.1 (2010-02-10)
==================

- Added ``_actual`` property which is like _editable, except that deleted
  items are not part of it.

- Also added is_actual method.

0.6 (2010-02-10)
================

- userid tracking for workflow events.

- change the way timestamps are recorded so that queries for older
  published items can more easily be constructed. This breaks existing
  databases. We assume nobody but the author is using Clio yet.

- stop using pysqlite in the tests; the tests now depend on MySQL.

- Introduce ACTUAL_STATUSES. This is what is present in the edit UI,
  except those things that were deleted. This can be handy in queries.

0.5 (2009-11-16)
================

- Initial public release.
