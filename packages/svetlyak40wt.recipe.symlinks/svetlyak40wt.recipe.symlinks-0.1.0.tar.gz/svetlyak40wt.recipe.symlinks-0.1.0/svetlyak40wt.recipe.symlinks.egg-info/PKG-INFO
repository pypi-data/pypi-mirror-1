        Usage
        -----
        
        This is a simple buildout recipe to collect symbolic links.
        
        For example, you have isolated buildout environment, but want
        pull some files from a standart debian's distribution os pyexiv2.
        
        In that case, you can collect all neccessary links in one directory
        and add it as 'extra-path'. Here is a minimal buildout.cfg:
        
        [buildout]
        parts = pyexiv2 python
        
        [pyexiv2]
        recipe = svetlyak40wt.recipe.symlinks
        path = parts/pyexiv2
        files =
        /usr/share/pyshared/pyexiv2.py
        /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/libpyexiv2.so
        
        [python]
        recipe = zc.recipe.egg
        interpreter = python
        eggs = ipython
        extra-paths = ${pyexiv2:path}
