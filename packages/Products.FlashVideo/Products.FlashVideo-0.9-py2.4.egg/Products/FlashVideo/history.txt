  2. For Plone 3 after installation (using portal_setup or

     Sponsored by Fry-IT

0.6 (21/03/2008) [llakomy]

  1. 'Profiles/default' directory created to store profile for Generic Setup tool.

  * import_steps.xml - Run import steps that can't be handled by XML configuration.
    (1) Call method that install FileSystemStoreage if exists.

  * propertiestool.xml - setting up some portal_properties

  * skins.xml - registering skin

  * types.xml - registering content types. Types definition in 'types' folder

  2. Fixed broken compatibility with Plone 2.1. File 'configure.zcml' is interpreted
     by Five. But because GenericSetup is not in Product folder error is raised. To
     prevent this a nasty code is added. If GS is not detected file is renamed and
     though - not interpreted.

0.5 (16/03/2008) [llakomy]

  1. 'Flash Video Playlist' added. New content type. New templates:

  * 'flashvideoplaylist_play.pt' - to play movies in the list.

  2. Basic compatibility with Plone 3. Added module 'utils' with methods that are
     not in Plone 3.0. But still uses the 'old way' using qucikinstaller.

  version 2.0.1

  2. Changed template flashvideo_view.pt to use new player.

  3. Changed mechanism to autogenerate id for FlashVideo. Instead
     filename use title (like for any other content). It is because the
     new player can't access image inside object with id that ends with '.flv'.

  * link 'movie.flv/screenshot.jpg' won't work but

  * link 'movie/screenshot.jpg' is ok

  4. Unit tests for FLVHeader class.
