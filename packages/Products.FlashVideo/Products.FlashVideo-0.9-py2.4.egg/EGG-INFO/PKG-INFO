Description: About
        
        This product's goal is to make adding videos to Plone very simple. There are
        other solutions that are offering the same functionality. But non of them
        is as simple and intuitive to use.
        
        It works in standard Plone way. Flash videos can be added as any other content,
        can have workflow, security settings ect.
        
        Flowplayer
        
        Flowplayer is a Flash application used to display Flash videos (.flv).
        More about it on "flowplayer.org":http://flowplayer.org. This product uses
        Flowplayer version 2.2.4.
        
        Installation
        
        Good practice:
        
        * Stop instance
        
        * Backup Data.fs
        
        FileSystemStorage [optional]
        
        * Copy "FileSystemStorage 2.6.2":http://plone.org/products/filesystemstorage/releases/2.6.2/filesystemstorage-2-6-2.tgz
        to Products folder. This is optional. When installed large movie files
        will be stored in filesystem (/var/fss_storage).
        
        * Warning: If you start using it don't remove it later!
        
        * Create 2 folders for external files: 'INSTANCE/var/fss_storage' and
        'INSTANCE/var/fss_backup'. For more details see FileSystemStorage
        documentation.
        
        Manual installation:
        
        * Extract archive
        
        * Copy 'FlashVideo' folder to <instance>/Products folder
        
        Buildout:
        
        * Just add 'Products.FlashVideo' to you 'buildout.conf'.
        
        Install FlashVideo in Plone. It can be done using 'portal_quickinstaller' or
        'portal_setup'. If FileSystemStorage product is detected it will be
        installed automatically too.
        
        Features
        
        * Easy to use. Creating content in standard Plone way.
        
        * Supports batch upload, integrated with "PloneFlashUpload":http://plone.org/products/ploneflashupload
        
        * Optimized. Doesn't overloads ZODB, stores FLV files in file system.
        
        * Multiplatform. Supports Plone 2.1, 2.5, 3.0, 3.1, works on Windows and *nix.
        
        * Multilingual. Can be translated to many languages.
        
        * Reliable and tested. All methods covered by unit and functional tests.
        
        Content Types
        
        * **Flash Video**. Main content type. Just upload your FLV file
        and screenshot image that should appear in player if the movie is not playing.
        Unfortunately this product cannot "extract" the first frame and do it itself.
        But it can calculate the resolution. [Thanks to FLVHeader class. I've implemented
        parser myself instead of using existing libraries to save space and number of
        files]. In "view" mode movie will be displayed in nice Flash player (FlowPlayer)
        
        * **Flash Video Playlist** This element can display many Flash Videos in consequtive
        order. This is not a folder, the videos can be selected using widget similar to
        "Related items". In "view" mode we can see all thumbnails of selected videos, to
        play them use "play" link or tab. Playlist itself does not have image but for display
        purposes it uses image from first movie on its list.
        
        * **Flash Video Folder**. Folder that can contain only Flash Videos and Playlists.
        Has special view that displays thumbnails of movies or playslists.
        
        Batch upload
        
        FTP/WebDAV
        
        If you are running FlashVideo-0.8.2 or older download recent version
        and reinstall product. This will ensure that Flash Video is registered in
        content types and MIME types registry. From now on you can use FTP or
        WebDAV to upload multiple files and all with 'video/x-flv' mime type
        will be saved as Flash Video objects.
        
        PloneFlashUpload
        
        We can use PFU to upload multiple vidoes. Just remember to update
        PloneFlashUpload settings in *SiteSetup->Flash upload*.
        Add 'Flash Video' to 'Valid Portal Types' so when '.flv' file is uploded
        can be converted to right content type instead of general File.
        
        Caveats
        
        When uploading video id of an object will be taken from the name of the file,
        but extension .flv will be removed and also all dots will be replaced by
        underscores. This is due to some bug in Flowplayer. Also title is set
        automatically from file name. All underscores and hyphens are replaced
        by spaces and first letter is capitalized.
        
        Testing
        
        Windows::
        
        <INSTANCE>/bin/test.bat -m Products.FlashVideo
        
        Linux::
        
        <INSTANCE>/bin/zopectl test -m Products.FlashVideo
