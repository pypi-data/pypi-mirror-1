pygit is (yet another) git bindings for python. It is rather low level because
it was meant to browse a git repository in terms of objects: you get a commit,
then the tree from it and you can get childs of this tree and so on.

While this doesn't make it that great to get statistical data on a repository
(you may take a look at gitpython for such things), it performs well for
repository editing, like adding a new revision, moving objects around, etc.
