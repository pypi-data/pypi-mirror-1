Description: zope.sendmail is a package for email sending from Zope 3 applications.
        Email sending from Zope 3 applications works as follows:
        
        A Zope 3 application locates a mail delivery utility
        (``IMailDelivery``) and feeds a message to it. It gets back a unique
        message ID so it can keep track of the message by subscribing to
        ``IMailEvent`` events.
        
        The utility registers with the transaction system to make sure the
        message is only sent when the transaction commits successfully.
        (Among other things this avoids duplicate messages on
        ``ConflictErrors``.)
        
        If the delivery utility is a ``IQueuedMailDelivery``, it puts the
        message into a queue (a Maildir mailbox in the file system). A
        separate process or thread (``IMailQueueProcessor``) watches the queue
        and delivers messages asynchronously. Since the queue is located in
        the file system, it survives Zope restarts or crashes and the mail is
        not lost.  The queue processor can implement batching to keep the
        server load low.
        
        If the delivery utility is a ``IDirectMailDelivery``, it delivers
        messages synchronously during the transaction commit.  This is not a
        very good idea, as it makes the user wait.  Note that transaction
        commits must not fail, but that is not a problem, because mail
        delivery problems dispatch an event instead of raising an exception.
        
        However, there is a problem -- sending events causes unknown code to
        be executed during the transaction commit phase.  There should be a
        way to start a new transaction for event processing after this one is
        commited.
        
        An ``IMailQueueProcessor`` or ``IDirectMailDelivery`` actually
        delivers the messages by using a mailer (``IMailer``) component that
        encapsulates the delivery process.  There currently is only one
        mailer:
        
        ``ISMTPMailer`` sends all messages to a relay host using SMTP.
        
        If mail delivery succeeds, an ``IMailSentEvent`` is dispatched by the
        mailer.  If mail delivery fails, no exceptions are raised, but an
        `IMailErrorEvent` is dispatched by the mailer.
