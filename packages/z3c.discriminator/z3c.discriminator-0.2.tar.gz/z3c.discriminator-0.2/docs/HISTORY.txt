Version 0.2  - November 26, 2007
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Discriminator machinery is now introduced globally by patching the global
  adapter registry and the GlobalObject configuration field.

  The ``discriminator`` method now returns an interface that is in all
  aspects equal to the discriminated interface except it's marked as a
  discriminator.
  
  Test suite have been expanded by including the entire test suite from
  ``zope.component``.
