Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Collective.portlet.map is a GMaps integration product. It leans on the Maps
        product, reading Maps configurations, and it uses adapters to extract
        geolocalizations.
        
        Using collective.portlet.map you can have a fully functional google map view in
        a portlet.
        
        How does it works
        
        Install collective.portlet.maps and Maps.
        
        Activate the "Map Portlet" and add one or more Location content in a folder.
        The Map Portlet will appear next to the folder view, showing all the Locations
        in a handy portlet map.
        
        
        Note
        
        Collective.portlet.map overrides the FolderMapView browser view for IATTopic
        and IFolder provided by Maps to enable the rendering of the portlet by Maps
        javascript code (activated only in maps_map in the original version).
        You can remove the new behavior removing the  collective.portlet.map-overrides
        directive in the buildout.
