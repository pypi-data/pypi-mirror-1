        Silva PluggableAuthService Support
        ----------------------------------
        
        This package provides a new service for PluggableAuthService (PAS)
        integration in Silva. Installing it will also create a new PAS
        *acl_user* for the Silva Root, pre-configured to add users in it.
        
        This extension require at least `Silva`_ 2.0.7 or higher.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        If you installed Silva using buildout, by getting one from the `Infrae
        SVN`_ repository, or creating one using `Paster`_, you should edit your
        buildout configuration file ``buildout.cfg`` to add or edit the
        following section::
        
        [instance]
        
        eggs = ...
        silva.pas.base
        
        zcml = ...
        silva.pas.base
        
        If the section ``instance`` wasn't already in the configuration file,
        pay attention to re-copy values for ``eggs`` and ``zcml`` from the
        profile you use.
        
        After you can restart buildout::
        
        $ ./bin/buildout
        
        
        If you don't use buildout, you can install this extension using
        ``easy_install``, and after create a file called
        ``silva.pas.base-configure.zcml`` in the
        ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  This file will
        responsible to load the extension and should only contain this::
        
        <include package="silva.pas.base" />
