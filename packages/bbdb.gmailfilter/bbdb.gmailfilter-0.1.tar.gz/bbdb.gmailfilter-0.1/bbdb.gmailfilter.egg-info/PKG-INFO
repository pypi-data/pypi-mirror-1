Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package installs a command-line python script and an emacs
        command for exporting a GMail filters Atom feed from the gnus-public
        and gnus-private fields in BBDB.
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        The package can be installed using the standard python package
        installation procedure.  Extract the tarball, then run the following
        command inside the extracted directory::
        
        $ python setup.py install
        
        This will install the command-line utility and the rpatterson-gmail.el
        emacs library.  Then add the following to your ~/.emacs::
        
        (require 'rpatterson-gmail)
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Once installed, the filters can be exported to a file simply by
        calling M-x bbdb-export-gmail-filters.  You will be prompted for a
        file to export the filters to.
        
        For every BBDB record that has a value in the gnus-private field, a
        filter will be included that matches the "To" GMail filter field on
        any BBDB net addresses for that record and applies the label specified
        in the gnus-private field value.  The same is done for BBDB records
        with values in the gnus-public BBDB field but filters on the "From"
        GMail filter field instead.
