The Twisted Spore API was created more for fun than anything else. There's
really nothing special about it, except that all resource fetching is done with
a Twisted web client (twisted.web.client.getPage).

When possible (given the async nature of the Twisted Spore API), code from the
blocking Python API was reused. This was done in an effort to maintain
functional compatibility with the synchronous Spore Python API. However, as it
turned out, there were several features missing from the other API as well as
some REST resources that don't work anymore as originally written in that API.

Note that to use this API as-in, you will need to have Twisted (Python)
installed. Downlowds for the latest release are always linked on the main page:
  http://twistedmatrix.com/

If there is interest in having a synchronous Python API updated to the latest
functionality as released by spore.com, I would be more than willing to add
explicit support for a non-Twisted API in this source code that could be used
even when Twisted is not installed.
