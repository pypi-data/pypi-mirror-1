0.10 (2009-11-26)
=================

- Add converter functionality for path segments. This makes it
  possible to ensure that a path segment is of a certain type, such as
  an integer, using ``a/:id:int``.

  Converters ``unicode``, ``str``, ``int``, ```unicodelist``,
  `strlist`` and ``intlist`` are known. ``unicode`` is the default
  converter used if no converter was specified. New converters can be
  registered using ``register_converter``. If a converter raises a
  ValueError, the path cannot be resolved.

0.9 (2009-11-16)
================

- Initial public release.
