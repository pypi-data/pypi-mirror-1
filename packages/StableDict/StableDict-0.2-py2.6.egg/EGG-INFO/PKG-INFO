Description: A dictionary class remembering insertion order.
        
        Order (i.e. the sequence) of insertions is remembered (internally
        stored in a hidden list attribute) and replayed when iterating.  A
        StableDict does NOT sort or organize the keys in any other way.
        
        Implemented as a subclass of the builtin dict type.  Very compact
        implementation (less than 150 lines of code).  Comes with a large
        testsuite derived from Python's test_dict.py in a separate test
        module.
