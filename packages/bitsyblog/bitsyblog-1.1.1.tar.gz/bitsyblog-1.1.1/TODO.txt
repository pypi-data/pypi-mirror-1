TODO
----

* DELETE posts (since browsers don't delete, maybe a POST request to
  /k0s/20080302221048 might have to be used)

* DELETE css files

* User preference:  number of links to display in nav by default

* How many posts to display by default at '/%(user)' ? 

* it would be nice if the viewed user's blog was added to the site nav

* years, months in a user's nav

* method for getting blog post title

* smarter permalinks;  should not use host_url

* blog entries now record the user so methods should not need the user
  to be passed in with the blog entry (code cleanup)

* single user bitsyblog -> BitsierBlog

* PUT to blog should edit (/k0s/20080302221048/edit should front end
  this, which renders the post form but with the text already inside
  and a datestamp specified)

* markup.form should have different layouts

* markup.form should (optionally?) use the Settings for validation, etc.

* better atom feeds?

* simple CAPTCHA auth for ephemeral users

* code cleanup (the eternal chore)

* middleware:
** CSS zen garden (samadhi)
** commenting
** tagging
