TODO
----

* POST to /k0s/20080302221048 to change permissions

* POST should fail if the body is blank

* feeds

>>> 1.0 is here

* mangled urls for sending secret and private posts to non-members

* DELETE posts (since browsers don't delete, maybe a POST request to
  /k0s/20080302221048 might have to be used)

* DELETE css files

* User preference:  number of links to display in nav by default

* How many posts to display by default at '/%(user)' ? 

* it would be nice if the viewed users' blog was added to the site nav

* PUT to blog should edit (/k0s/20080302221048/edit should front end
  this, which renders the post form but with the text already inside
  and a datestamp specified)

* markup.form should have different layouts

* markup.form should (optionally?) use the Settings for validation, etc.

* code cleanup (the eternal chore)

* middleware:
** commenting
** tagging
