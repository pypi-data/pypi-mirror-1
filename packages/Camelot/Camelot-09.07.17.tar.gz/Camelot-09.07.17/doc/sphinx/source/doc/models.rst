This section describes the various field types that can be used to construct
models. Fields from SQLAlchemy and Camelot are described.

Fields calculated by the database
=================================

Having certain summary fields of your models filled by the database has the advantage
that the heavy processing is moved from the client to the server.  Moreover if the 
summary builds on information in related records, having the database build the summary
reduces the need to transfer additional data from the database to the server.

To display fields in the table and the form view that are the result of a calculation 
done by the database, a ColumnProperty needs to be defined in the Elixir model.  In this 
ColumnProperty, the sql query can be defined using sqlalchemy statements.  Then use the 
field attributes mechanism to specify which delegate needs to be used to render the field.

As an example we will create a budget with multiple budget lines, where the total budget 
is calculated by the database ::

	from elixir.properties import ColumnProperty
	from camelot.view.controls import delegates
	from sqlalchemy import sql, and_
	
	class Budget(Entity):
	  lines = OneToMany('BudgetLine')
	  total = ColumnProperty(lambda c:sql.select([sql.func.sum(BudgetLine.amount)], and_(BudgetLine.budget_id==Budget.id)))
	
	   class Admin(EntityAdmin):
	    name = 'Budgets'
	    list_display = [ 'total', 'lines']
	    field_attributes = {'total':{'delegate':delegates.FloatColumnDelegate}} 
	
	class BudgetLine(Entity):
	  budget = ManyToOne('Budget', required=True, ondelete='cascade', onupdate='cascade')
	  amount = Field(Float(precision=2), default=0)
	
	  class Admin(EntityAdmin):
	    name = 'Budget lines'
	    list_display = ['amount',] 
	    
When the user presses F9, all data in the application is refreshed from the database, and thus
all fields are recalculated.

An explanation of the lambda function inside the ColumnProperty can be found in the ElixirColumnProperty_ and
the SqlalchemyMappers_ documentation.
