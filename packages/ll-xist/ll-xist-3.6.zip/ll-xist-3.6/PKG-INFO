Description: XIST provides an extensible HTML and XML generator. XIST is also a XML parser
        with a very simple and pythonesque tree API. Every XML element type corresponds
        to a Python class and these Python classes provide a conversion method to
        transform the XML tree (e.g. into HTML). XIST can be considered
        'object oriented XSLT'.
        
        XIST also includes the following modules:
        
        * ``ll.astyle`` can be used for colored terminal output (via ANSI escape
        sequences).
        
        * ``ll.color`` provides classes and functions for handling RGB color values.
        This includes the ability to convert between different color models
        (RGB, HSV, HLS) as well as to and from CSS format, and several functions
        for modifying and mixing colors.
        
        * ``ll.make`` is an object oriented make replacement. Like make it allows
        you to specify dependencies between files and actions to be executed
        when files don't exist or are out of date with respect to one
        of their sources. But unlike make you can do this in a object oriented
        way and targets are not only limited to files, but you can implement
        e.g. dependencies on database records.
        
        * ``ll.misc`` provides several small utility functions and classes.
        
        * ``ll.sisyphus`` provides classes for running Python scripts as cron jobs.
        
        * ``ll.daemon`` can be used on UNIX to fork a daemon process.
        
        * ``ll.url`` provides classes for parsing and constructing RFC 2396
        compliant URLs.
        
        * ``ll.ul4c`` is compiler for a templating language with similar capabilities
        to `Django's templating language`__. ``UL4`` templates are compiled to an
        internal bytecode format, which makes it possible to implement template
        renderers in other languages and makes the template code "secure" (i.e.
        template code can't open or delete files).
        
        __ http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/templates/
        
        * ``ll.xml_codec`` contains a complete codec for encoding and decoding XML.
        
        
        Changes in 3.6 (released 12/31/2008)
        ------------------------------------
        
        * The following ``Color`` class methods have been dropped: ``fromrgba``,
        ``fromrgba4``, ``fromrgba8``, ``fromint4``, ``fromint8``.
        
        * The following ``Color`` properties have been dropped: ``r4``, ``g4``,
        ``b4``, ``a4``, ``r8``, ``g8``, ``b8``, ``a8``, ``r``, ``g``, ``b``,  ``a``
        ``int4``, ``int8``, ``rgb4``, ``rgba4``, ``rgb8``, and ``rgba8`` have been
        dropped. The new methods ``r``, ``g``, ``b`` and ``a`` return the 8 bit
        component values.
        
        * The class methods ``fromhsva`` and ``fromhlsa`` have been renamed to
        ``fromhsv`` and ``fromhls``.
        
        * The property ``css`` has been dropped instead the CSS string is returned
        by ``__str__``.
        
        * Dividing color now does a scalar division. Blending colors is now done with
        the modulo operator.
        
        * Support for color objects has been added to UL4.
        
        * The XPIT templating language and ``ll.make.XPITAction``` have been
        removed.
        
        * Fixed a bug in ``ll.make.CacheAction.get``: The action must return real
        data when called with ``bigbang`` as the timestamp.
        
        * ``ll.make.UL4RenderAction``` has been fixed.
