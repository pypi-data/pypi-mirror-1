Description: XIST is an extensible HTML and XML generator. XIST is also a XML parser with a
        very simple and pythonesque tree API. Every XML element type corresponds to a
        Python class and these Python classes provide a conversion method to transform
        the XML tree (e.g. into HTML). XIST can be considered 'object oriented XSLT'.
        
        XIST also includes the following modules:
        
        * ``ll.astyle`` can be used for colored terminal output (via ANSI escape
        sequences).
        
        * ``color`` provides classes and functions for handling RGB color values.
        This includes the ability to convert between different color models
        (RGB, HSV, HLS) as well as to and from CSS format, and several functions
        for modifying and mixing colors.
        
        * ``ll.make`` is an object oriented make replacement. Like make it allows
        you to specify dependencies between files and actions to be executed
        when files don't exist or are out of date with respect to one
        of their sources. But unlike make you can do this in a object oriented
        way and targets are not only limited to files, but you can implement
        e.g. dependencies on database records.
        
        * ``ll.misc`` provides several small utility functions and classes.
        
        * ``ll.sisyphus`` provides classes for running Python scripts as cron jobs.
        
        * ``ll.daemon`` can be used on UNIX to fork a daemon process.
        
        * ``ll.url`` provides classes for parsing and constructing RFC 2396
        compliant URLs.
        
        * ``ll.xpit`` is a module that makes it possible to embed Python
        expressions in text (as XML style processing instructions).
        
        * ``ll.xml_codec`` contains a complete codec for encoding and decoding XML.
        
        
        Changes in 3.2 (released 02/01/2008)
        ------------------------------------
        
        * The core package has been moved into XIST, installing XIST now only requires
        one package.
        
        * ``ll.toxic`` has been moved into XIST and is now available as
        ``ll.xist.ns.toxic``.
        
        * When a ``ll.make.XISTParseAction`` object is executed the content of
        the pool will now be extended by the content of the pool from the
        ``XISTPoolAction`` instead of being replaced.
        
        * ``ll.make.Pool`` and ``ll.xist.xsc.Pool`` no longer use a
        ``WeakValueDictionary``, but a simple ``dict``. This means they
        can now store *any* object. A method ``clear`` has been added, which
        removes all registered objects.
        
        * Fixed a bug in ``ll.xist.css.iterrules`` that surfaced when a
        ``base`` argument was given.
        
        * Fixed a second bug in ``ll.xist.css.iterrules`` where the ``href`` of a
        ``link`` element wasn't applied to the URLs in the stylesheet.
