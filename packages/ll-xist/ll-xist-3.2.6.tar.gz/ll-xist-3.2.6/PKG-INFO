Description: XIST is an extensible HTML and XML generator. XIST is also a XML parser with a
        very simple and pythonesque tree API. Every XML element type corresponds to a
        Python class and these Python classes provide a conversion method to transform
        the XML tree (e.g. into HTML). XIST can be considered 'object oriented XSLT'.
        
        XIST also includes the following modules:
        
        * ``ll.astyle`` can be used for colored terminal output (via ANSI escape
        sequences).
        
        * ``ll.color`` provides classes and functions for handling RGB color values.
        This includes the ability to convert between different color models
        (RGB, HSV, HLS) as well as to and from CSS format, and several functions
        for modifying and mixing colors.
        
        * ``ll.make`` is an object oriented make replacement. Like make it allows
        you to specify dependencies between files and actions to be executed
        when files don't exist or are out of date with respect to one
        of their sources. But unlike make you can do this in a object oriented
        way and targets are not only limited to files, but you can implement
        e.g. dependencies on database records.
        
        * ``ll.misc`` provides several small utility functions and classes.
        
        * ``ll.sisyphus`` provides classes for running Python scripts as cron jobs.
        
        * ``ll.daemon`` can be used on UNIX to fork a daemon process.
        
        * ``ll.url`` provides classes for parsing and constructing RFC 2396
        compliant URLs.
        
        * ``ll.xpit`` is a module that makes it possible to embed Python
        expressions in text (as XML style processing instructions).
        
        * ``ll.xml_codec`` contains a complete codec for encoding and decoding XML.
        
        
        Changes in 3.2.6 (released 05/07/2008)
        --------------------------------------
        
        * A new action class ``EvalAction`` has been added to ``ll.make``.
        
        * ``ll.xist.helpers.escapetext`` and ``ll.xist.helpers.escapeattr``
        have been merged into one function that escapes all special characters
        (including ``'`` and ``"``) and has been renamed/moved to
        ``ll.misc.xmlescape``.
        
        * Python versions of all the functions in the module ``ll.misc`` have been
        added that will be used, in case the C module is not available.
