                                History
                                =======

Changes in 2.15.4 (released 07/16/2007)
=======================================

     * The Python quotes example now always parses the file from the
       original URL.
     * The Python quotes and the media example now print the result
       to stdout.

Changes in 2.15.3 (released 07/16/2007)
=======================================

     * Use a consistent license (MIT) everywhere. This should make
       XIST Debian compatible.
     * Change the Python quotes example, so that it works even if
       there's no python-quotes.xml in the current directory.

Changes in 2.15.2 (released 01/24/2007)
=======================================

     * Fixed a bug in presenters.CodePresenter.__str__.
     * Fixed base URL handling for tidy parsing.
     * Updated examples.
     * Updated xiter and xattrs implementation for Node and Namespace
       to conform to the newest version of IPython.

Changes in 2.15.1 (released 09/25/2006)
=======================================

     * Fixed a few bugs in the sgmlop function declarations.
     * Readded the spacer pixel.

Changes in 2.15 (released 09/24/2006)
=====================================

     * XIST has been made compatible with Python 2.5: Code has been
       updated to use the proper C API for memory management and PEP
       353 support has been added. XIST now includes its own fixed
       version of sgmlop.
     * The ll.xist.xsc.Attrs methods with and without have been
       renamed to withnames and withoutnames for Python 2.5
       compatibility.
     * ll.xist.ns.htmlspecials.pixel no longer handles colors via
       different GIFs. It uses the background-color in the style
       attribute instead. The same change has been implemented for
       ll.xist.ns.htmlspecials.autopixel. It's now possible to
       overwrite the default src attribute value of root:px/spc.gif
       either via the XML attribute or via the converter context.
     * The node method asText has been made a function, moved into
       the html namespace and renamed to astext. Furthermore elinks
       is used for plain text formatting now instead of w3m.

Changes in 2.14.2 (released 07/04/2006)
=======================================

     * Fixed a bug in the presentAttr method of
       ll.xist.presenters.TreePresenter.

Changes in 2.14.1 (released 06/29/2006)
=======================================

     * Fixed a bug in the presentEntity method of
       ll.xist.presenters.CodePresenter.
     * Updated installation instructions.

Changes in 2.14 (released 06/28/2006)
=====================================

     * Namespaces for RSS 0.91, RSS 2.0 and Atom 1.0 have been added.
     * A new namespace ll.xist.ns.detox has been added that is
       similar to ll.toxic but can be used to generate Python code
       instead of PL/SQL code. Using detox templates is about 50
       times faster than using XIST trees directly and about 10 times
       faster than Kid.
     * Presenters are now compatible to IPython's ipipe module. This
       means that you can browse XIST trees interactively if you have
       IPython installed. NormalPresenter and the Node methods repr
       and asrepr have been removed.
     * A new processing instruction ll.xist.ns.specials.url has been
       added that does the same URL transformation as
       ll.xist.xsc.URLAttr does.
     * On publishing ll.xist.ns.html.html now only adds a lang and
       xml:lang attribute, if neither of them exists.
     * setuptools is now supported for installation.

Changes in 2.13 (released 10/31/2005)
=====================================

     * ll.xist.xsc.Namespace.tokenize requires a unicode object as
       input now. This makes it possible to use encodings that are
       not ASCII compatible (such as UTF-16). The encoding argument
       is gone.
     * ll.xist.xsc.Node.asString uses the encoding argument to
       determine which characters have to be output as character
       references now. (You'll still get a unicode object as the
       result.)
     * A new processing instruction class ll.xist.ns.specials.literal
       has been added, that will output its content literally when
       published. This can be used for embedding preformatted XML
       (e.g. from a database) into an XIST tree.

Changes in 2.12 (released 10/13/2005)
=====================================

     * Namespaces for Relax NG and Kid have been added.
     * XIST requires version 1.0 of the core package now.
     * The class name for the DocBook DTD class has been fixed.

Changes in 2.11 (released 07/29/2005)
=====================================

     * A script xml2xsc.py has been added, that can be used to parse
       an XML file and generate a rudimentary XIST namespace from it.
     * A DocType for XHTML 1.1 has been added (suggested by Elvelind
       Grandin).
     * Line number information is now added when parsing HTML.
     * The sorted method now supports the same arguments (cmp, key
       and reverse) as list.sort and sorted in Python 2.4.
     * The walk doesn't yield the node directly, but yields a Cursor
       object now, with has several ways of referencing the node.
     * New methods walknode, walkpath and walkindex have been added.
     * Presenters use an iterator API instead of a stream API now.
       Dumping an XML tree presentation to the terminal can now start
       immediately instead of having to wait for the complete string
       to be formatted.
     * Fixed a bug with element/attribute names that contained a .
       character. (This broke ll.xist.ns.fo.)
     * Fixed a bug with xmlns attributes in nested elements. When an
       element ended the parser restored the wrong prefix mapping.
     * The python-quotes demo has been updated to use the current
       version of AMK's XML file.
     * Removed iterator stuff from ll.xist.xfind, as this is now part
       of the ll package/module.
     * The function ToNode has been renamed to tonode.
     * ll.xist.Context no longer subclasses list.
     * ll.xist.ns.doc.explain will now try to output the objects in
       the order in which they appear in the Python source.
     * The node methods find and findfirst have been removed.
     * ll.xist.ns.cond now uses a sandbox dictionary in a converter
       context for evaluating expression.

Changes in 2.10 (released 05/20/2005)
=====================================

     * The content of the processing instruction
       ll.xist.ns.code.pyexec will not be executed at construction
       time, but at conversion time. The code in
       ll.xist.ns.code.pyexec or ll.xist.ns.code.pyeval will no
       longer be executed in the ll.xist.sandbox module (which has
       been removed), but in a sandbox dictionary in the converter
       context of the ll.xist.ns.code namespace.
     * The tests have been ported to py.test.
     * The method mapped is now callable without arguments. In this
       case a converter will be created on the fly. You can pass
       constructor arguments for this converter to mapped as keyword
       arguments.
     * The publishing API has changed again:
       ll.xist.publishers.Publisher.publish no longer accepts an
       argument stream to which the byte strings are written, but it
       is a generator now. The publisher methods write and writetext
       have been renamed to encode and encodetext and return the
       encoded byte string, instead of writing it directly to the
       stream. There's a new generator method bytes for nodes now,
       which can be passed the same arguments as asBytes. These
       changes should help when using XIST in WSGI applications.
     * The iterator returned from Element.__getitem__,
       Frag.__getitem__ and the walk method now supports __getitem__
       itself, so you can write table[html.tr][0] to get the first
       row from a table or page.walk(xsc.FindTypeAll(html.td))[-1] to
       get the last table cell from a complete HTML page.
     * Several bugs in the namespaces ll.xist.ns.meta,
       ll.xist.ns.form and ll.xist.ns.specials have been fixed.
     * The namespace modules ll.xist.ns.css and
       ll.xist.ns.cssspecials have been removed.

Changes in 2.9 (released 04/21/2005)
====================================

     * XIST trees can now be pickled. The only restriction is that
       global attributes must come from a namespace that has been
       turned into a module via makemod, so that this module can be
       imported on unpickling.
     * Two arguments of the walk method have been renamed: filtermode
       has been renamed to inmode and walkmode has been renamed to
       outmode. For these modes two new values are supported:

            ll.xist.xsc.walkindex
                    The value passed to the filter function or
                    yielded from the iterator is a list containing
                    child indizes and attribute names that specify
                    the path to the node in question.

            ll.xist.xsc.walkrootindex
                    The filter function will be called with two
                    arguments: The first is the root node of the tree
                    (i.e. the node for which walk has been called),
                    the second one is an index path (just like for
                    ll.xist.xsc.walkindex). If used as an outmode a
                    tuple with these two values will be yielded.

     * Attribute mappings now support __getitem__, __setitem__ and
       __delitem__ with list arguments, i.e. you can do:

 >>> from ll.xist.ns import html
 >>> e = html.a("gurk", href=("hinz", "kunz"))
 >>> print e.attrs[["href", 0]]
 hinz
 >>> e.attrs[["href", 0]] = "hurz"
 >>> print e["href"]
 hurzkunz
 >>> del e.attrs[["href", 0]]
 >>> print e["href"]
 kunz

     * XML attributes can now be accessed as Python attributes, i.e.

 >>> from ll.xist.ns import html
 >>> e = html.a("spam", href="eggs")
 >>> print e.attrs.href
 eggs

       (Don't confuse this with e.Attrs.href which is the attribute
       class.)

     * Frag and Element now support Node subclasses as arguments to
       their __getitem__ method: An iterator for all children of the
       specified type will be returned.
     * The encoding used for parsing now defaults to None. When
       reading from an URL and no default encoding has been specified
       the one from the Content-Type header will be used. If this
       still doesn't result in a usable encoding, "utf-8" will be
       used when parsing XML and "iso-8859-1" will be used when
       parsing broken HTML.
     * All error and warning classes from ll.xist.errors have been
       merged into ll.xist.xsc. This avoids import problems with
       circular imports.
     * The attributes showLocation and showPath of
       ll.xist.presenters.TreePresenter have been lowercased and
       presenters are properly reset after they've done their job.
     * The class attribute xmlname will no longer be turned into a
       list containing the Python and the XML name, but will be the
       XML name only. You can get the Python name from
       foo.__class__.__name__.
     * DeprecationWarnings for name and attrHandlers have finally
       been removed.
     * Instances of ll.xist.xsc.Entity subclasses can now be
       compared. __eq__ simply checks if the objects are instances of
       the same class.

Changes in 2.8.1 (released 03/22/2005)
======================================

     * Added a note about the package init file to the installation
       documentation.

Changes in 2.8 (released 01/03/2005)
====================================

     * XIST requires Python 2.4 now.
     * ll.xist.ns.specials.x has been renamed to
       ll.xist.ns.specials.ignore.
     * ll.xist.utils.findAttr has been renamed to
       ll.xist.utils.findattr.
     * ll.xist.xfind.item no longer handles slices.
     * XFind has been enhanced to support item and slice operators,
       i.e. if foo is an XFind operator, foo[0] is an operator that
       will produce the first node from foo (if there is one).
       Negative values and slices are supported too.
     * Operators can be chained via division: html.a/html.b is an
       operator that can be passed around and applied to a node.
     * XIST requires the new core module and makes use of the new
       "cooperative displayhook" functionality defined there: If you
       install the displayhook you can tweak or replace
       ll.xist.presenters.hookpresenter to change the output.

Changes in 2.7 (released 11/24/2004)
====================================

     * The transparent pixel used by ll.xist.ns.htmlspecials.pixel
       has been renamed to spc.gif to avoid problems with IE.
     * Removed a debug print in ll.xist.xfind.Finder.__getitem__.
     * ll.xist.xfind now has a new function item, that can be used to
       get a certain item or slice from an iterator. xfind.first and
       xfind.last have been changed to use xfind.item, so you now
       have to pass a default value to get the old behaviour.
     * Obsolete options in ll.xist.options have been removed (and
       reprEncoding has been renamed to reprencoding).

Changes in 2.6.2 (released 06/06/2005)
======================================

     * Fixed a bug in ll.xist.parsers.Parser.parse.

Changes in 2.6.1 (released 11/02/2004)
======================================

     * Fixed a bug in ll.xist.xfind.Finder.__floordiv__.
     * Restricted characters as defined in XML 1.1 will now be
       published as character references.

Changes in 2.6 (released 10/26/2004)
====================================

     * ToNode now tries iterating through the value passed in, so
       it's now possible to pass iterators and generators (and
       generator expressions in Python 2.4) to Frag and Element
       constructors.
     * A new API named XFind has been added for iterating through XML
       trees. XFind expressions look somewhat like XPath expressions
       but are pure Python expressions. For example finding all
       images inside links in an HTML page can be done like this:

 from ll.xist import parsers, xfind
 from ll.xist.ns import html
 node = parsers.parseURL("http://www.python.org/", tidy=True)
 for img in node//html.a/html.img:
    print img["src"]

       The module ll.xist.xfind contains several operators that can
       be used in XFind expressions.

     * Parsing broken HTML is now done with the HTML parser from
       libxml2. The parsing functions no longer accept options for
       tidy, only the boolean value of the tidy argument is used.
     * The publishing API has been simplified: Publication can now be
       done with a call to ll.xist.publishers.Publisher.publish,
       passing in a ll.xist.xsc.Node. Writing strings to the
       publisher output is now done with
       ll.xist.publishers.Publisher.write. The methods
       beginPublication and endPublication have been removed.
     * The presentation API has been simplified in the same way:
       You'll get a presentation by calling: string =
       presenter.present(node). The methods beginPresentation and
       endPresentation have been removed.
     * The parser now has the option to ignore illegal elements,
       attributes, processing instructions and entities. The default
       behaviour is to raise an exception, but this can now be
       reconfigured via Python's warning framework.
     * The classmethod tokenize from ll.toxic has been moved to
       ll.xist.xsc.Namespace, so it's now possible to tokenize an XML
       string for other processing instructions as well.
     * A new class ll.xist.xsc.NSPool has been added. An NSPool
       contains a pool of namespaces from which the parser selects
       the appropriate namespace once an xmlns attribute is
       encountered.
     * The script xscmake.py (which has been unmaintained for a while
       now) has been removed.
     * Elements hostname, tty, prompt and input were add to
       ll.xist.ns.doc.
     * The method ll.xist.xsc.Attrs.set now returns the new attribute
       object.
     * The visit method has been removed.
     * ll.xist.xsc.FindOld has been removed.
     * ll.xist.ns.xml.header has been renamed to
       ll.xist.ns.xml.declaration.

Changes in 2.5 (released 06/30/2004)
====================================

     * Specifying content models for elements has seen major
       enhancements. The boolean class attribute empty has been
       replaced by an object model whose checkvalid method will be
       called for validating the element content.
     * A new module ll.xist.sims has been added that provides a
       simple schema validation. Schema violations will be reported
       via Pythons warning framework.
     * All namespace modules have been updated to use sims
       information. The SVG module has been updated to SVG 1.1. The
       docbook module has been updated to DocBook 4.3.
     * It's possible to switch off validation during parsing and
       publishing.
     * ll.xist.xsc.Frag and ll.xist.xsc.Element both have a __call__
       method with the same arguments as their constructors. Those
       methods will append content nodes (and set attributes for
       ll.xist.xsc.Element) and return self, so they can be used when
       creating an object tree. This makes it possible to put the
       attributes close to the tag name, instead of putting them at
       the end after the content.

       Instead of:

 node = html.table(
    html.tr(
       html.td("foo"),
       html.td("bar"),
    ),
    html.tr(
       html.td("spam"),
       html.td("eggs")
    ),
    class_="example"
 )

       you can now use the following:

 node = html.table(class_="example")(
    html.tr(
       html.td("foo"),
       html.td("bar"),
    ),
    html.tr(
       html.td("spam"),
       html.td("eggs")
    )
 )

     * Experimental support for Holger Krekel's XPython has been
       added. Code might look like this:

 from ll.xist import xsc, converters
 from ll.xist.ns import html, meta

 import random

 c = converters.Converter()
 <c>:
    <html.html()>:
       <html.head()>:
          <meta.contenttype()>: pass
          <html.title()>:
             xsc.append("The title")
       <html.body(class_="foo")>:
          <html.h1()>:
             flag = random.choice((0, 1))
             if flag:
                xsc.append("The foo page", class_="foo")
             else:
                xsc.append("The bar page", class_="bar")
          <html.p()>:
             if flag:
                xsc.append("The foo content")
             else:
                xsc.append("The bar content")

 print c.lastnode.asBytes()

     * Creating global attributes has been simplified. Passing an
       instance of ll.xist.xsc.Namespace.Attrs to an Element
       constructor now does the right thing:

 from ll.xist.ns import html, xml
 node = html.html(
    html.head(),
    xml.Attrs(lang="de"),
    lang="en",
 )

     * Creating skeleton implementations of XIST namespaces is no
       longer done via XML conversion (i.e. the namespace module
       ll.xist.ns.xndl), but through the new module ll.xist.xnd. The
       script dtdxsc.py will automatically generate sims information.
     * ll.xist.xsc.CharRef now inherits from ll.xist.xsc.Text too, so
       you don't have to special case CharRefs any more. When
       publishing, CharRefs will be handled like Text nodes.
     * ll.xist.ns.meta.contenttype now has an attribute mimetype
       (defaulting to "text/html") for specifying the MIME type.
     * ll.xist.ns.htmlspecials.caps has been removed.
     * Registering elements in namespace classes has been rewritten
       to use a cache now.
     * Pretty printing has been changed: Whitespace will only be
       added now if there are no text nodes in element content.
     * Two mailing lists are now available: One for discussion about
       XIST and one for XIST announcements.

Changes in 2.4.1 (released 01/05/2004)
======================================

     * Changed the xmlname of ll.xist.ns.jsp.directive_page back
       again (it's directive.page only for the XML form, which we
       don't use anyway.)
     * Drop the default value for
       ll.xist.ns.jsp.directive_page.Attrs.language, as this
       attribute can only be used once.
     * If an ll.xist.xsc.Prefixes object has a prefix mapping for a
       namespace it will return this prefix too, if asked for a
       prefix for a subclass of this namespace.

Changes in 2.4 (released 01/02/2004)
====================================

     * The class ll.xist.parsers.Handler has been renamed to Parser
       and has been made reusable, i.e. it is possible to instantiate
       a parser once and use it multiple times for parsing. All the
       classes derived from xml.sax.xmlreader.InputSource have been
       dropped and the methods for parsing strings, URLs and files
       have been implemented as methods of the parser. Most of the
       arguments that had to be passed to the various parsing
       functions are passed to the parser constructor now. The basic
       parsing functionality is implemented by parsing streams
       instead of InputSources.
     * Similar to the changes for parsing, publishers have been
       changed to be reusable and most arguments to the publishing
       functions are available as arguments to the publisher
       constructor.
     * Now converter contexts are no longer bound to an element
       class, but to the context class defined by the element class,
       i.e. the attribute Context of the argument for
       Converter.__getitem__ will be used as the dictionary key. This
       makes it possible to use a class and it subclasses
       interchangeably (as long as the base class defines its own
       Context class and the subclasses don't overwrite it).
     * Added a find functor FindTypeAllAttrs that searches content
       and attributes.
     * Fixed the XML name for ll.xist.ns.jsp.directive_page.
     * All character references in ll.xist.ns.ihtml that exist in
       ll.xist.ns.chars too have been removed.

Changes in 2.3 (released 12/08/2003)
====================================

     * It's now possible to parse XML without generating location
       information for each node, by passing loc=False to the
       constructor of the Handler.
     * The HTMLParser no longer complains about global attributes or
       xmlns.
     * XIST now supports µTidylib in addition to mxTidy. If µTidylib
       is found it is preferred over mxTidy.
     * It's possible now to pass arguments to tidy simple by passing
       an argument dictionary for the tidy argument in the parsing
       functions.
     * The methods parsed and checkvalid have been separated.
     * ll.xist.ns.htmlspecials.pixel and
       ll.xist.ns.htmlspecials.autopixel now check whether their
       color attribute is ok.
     * The base URL is now set correctly when parsing from an URL
       even if the original URL does a redirect. (This requires
       ll.url version 0.11.3).
     * Namespace handling has been rewritten again, to be more
       standards compliant: Now there is no prefixes for entities and
       processing instructions any longer. Prefix mappings can be
       created much simpler, and they no longer contain any namespace
       stack for parsing, as this is now done by the parser itself.
       xsc.NamespaceAttrMixIn is gone too.
     * The processing instructions exec_ and eval_ from
       ll.xist.ns.code have been renamed to pyexec and pyeval and
       import_ has been removed.
     * CharRefs from ll.xist.ns.html have been moved to a new module
       named ll.xist.ns.chars.
     * The method names beginPublication, endPublication and
       doPublication have been lowercased.

Changes in 2.2 (released 07/31/2003)
====================================

     * Namespace handling has been completely rewritten. Namespaces
       are now classes derived from ll.xist.xsc.Namespace. Defining
       element classes can be done inside or outside the namespace
       class. If the element classes are defined outside the
       namespace class, they can be moved inside the namespace with a
       simple attribute assignment:

 class foo(xsc.Element):
    empty = False

 class xmlns(xsc.Namespace):
    xmlname = "foo"
    xmlurl = "http://www.foo.com/ns/foo"

 xmlns.foo = foo

       The methods elementkeys, iterelementkeys, elementvalues,
       iterelementvalues, elementitems and iterelementitems can be
       used for iterating through the element classes and their
       names. You can use the method element to get an element class
       with a certain name:

 >>> from ll.xist.ns import html
 >>> html.element("div")
 <element class ll.xist.ns.html/div at 0x824363c>

       For processing instructions, entities and character references
       similar methods are available.

       The method update can be used to add many element classes to a
       namespace at once, simply by passing a dictionary with those
       classes (use vars() to add everything that's defined inside
       your module). The method updatenew does the same, but copies
       only those attributes that don't exist in the namespace,
       updateexisting copies only those that do exist. You can turn a
       namespace into a module with makemod:

 from ll.xist import xsc

 class foo(xsc.Element):
    empty = False

 class xmlns(xsc.Namespace):
    xmlname = "foo"
    xmlurl = "http://www.foo.com/ns/foo"
 xmlns.makemod(vars())

       Put the above code into foo.py and you can do the following:

 >>> import foo
 >>> foo
 <namespace foo/xmlns name=u'foo' url=u'http://www.foo.com/ns/foo' with 1 elements from 'foo.py' at 0x81bfc14>

     * getns has been dropped, so you always have to pass in a
       Namespace class where a namespace is required.
     * For the ll.xist.ns.jsp.directive_page element automatic
       generation of the correct charset option in the contentType
       attribute is only done when there is a contentType attribute,
       as contentType is optional.
     * The converter has a new property node. node can't be passed to
       conv but will be set to self by conv automatically. This makes
       it possible to access the "document root" during conversion.
     * ll.xist.ns.htmlspecials.autoimg no longer touches existing
       width and height attributes. This means that %-formatting of
       the existing attributes is no longer done.
     * Added a new class ll.xist.ns.htmlspecials.autopixel that works
       like ll.xist.ns.htmlspecials.pixel but inherits the size for
       the image specified via the src attribute.
     * Frag and Element now support extended slices.
     * Frag and Element now support the methods extend and __iadd__.
     * For walking the tree the method walk has been completely
       rewritten and a new method visit has been added. For more info
       see the docstrings.
     * Node now has two new methods copy and deepcopy and supports
       the copy module from the Python standard library.
     * Calling mapped through conv has been removed. You again have
       to call mapped directly and pass a node and a converter.
     * The HTML handling of the HTMLParser has been improved (it now
       uses code from xml.sax.drivers2.drv_sgmlop_html (which is part
       of PyXML)).
     * The core functionality found in the script dtd2xsc.py has been
       moved to a class method ll.xist.ns.xndl.fromdtd in the
       ll.xist.ns.xndl namespace.
     * ll.xist.parsers.ExpatParser is now a real subclass instead of
       an alias for xml.sax.expatreader.ExpatParser It reports
       unknown entity references to the application (if loading of
       external entities is switched off, which is done by
       ll.xist.parsers.Handler and only outside of attributes).
     * Namespaces have been added for Zope's TAL and METAL
       specifications.
     * A namespace has been added for XSL-FO.

Changes in 2.1.4 (released 06/13/2003)
======================================

     * Remove the checks for attributes in attributes and moved the
       publication code for the full element into a separate method.
       This allows JSP tag library namespaces to simply overwrite
       publish to publish the element even inside attributes. (This
       is the same fix as in release 1.5.10)

Changes in 2.1.3 (released 05/07/2003)
======================================

     * The methods sorted, reversed and shuffled have been rewritten
       so they no longer use sys.maxint. This change fixes those
       methods for 64 bit platforms (reported by Giles Frances Hall)

Changes in 2.1.2 (released 02/27/2003)
======================================

     * ll.xist.ns.struts_config11.plug_in now allows content (as the
       DTD states). (This is the same fix as in release 1.5.8.)

Changes in 2.1.1 (released 02/11/2003)
======================================

     * Added a few elements and attributes to ll.xist.ns.doc:
       username, which is used for the name of a user account, xref,
       which is used for internal cross references and the attribute
       id for section, which specifies the target for an xref.

Changes in 2.1 (released 12/09/2002)
====================================

     * Added a new namespace module ll.xist.ns.xndl that contains the
       "XIST namespace definition language", i.e. elements that
       describe an XIST namespace and can be used by various scripts
       to generate skeleton namespace modules. The first of these
       script is the DTD to namespace converter dtd2xsc.py.
     * Added a new namespace module ll.xist.ns.tld that contains the
       definition for Java Server Pages Tag Library descriptors and a
       script tld2xsc.py that uses this namespace to generate
       namespace modules from tld files.
     * Attr now supports the method filtered. This is used by without
       now. The arguments for without have changed, because handling
       global attributes was too "magic". A new method with has been
       added, with does the opposite of without, i.e. it removes all
       attributes that are not specified as parameters.
     * The Python name of each Node subclass is now available as the
       class attribute pyname.
     * To continue the great renaming withSep has been renamed to
       withsep.
     * The namespace name for the ll.xist.ns.struts_html module has
       been fixed.
     * The argument defaultEncoding for the various parsing functions
       has been renamed to encoding.

Changes in 2.0.8 (released 11/20/2002)
======================================

     * ll.xist.ns.doc.getDoc has been renamed to getdoc.
     * The CSS parser was dropping the % from percentage values. This
       has been fixed.

Changes in 2.0.7 (released 11/12/2002)
======================================

     * xsc.Element.__nonzero__ can no longer fall back to
       xsc.Frag.__nonzero__. (this is the same fix as in 1.5.7).

Changes in 2.0.6 (released 11/11/2002)
======================================

     * Performance optimizations.

Changes in 2.0.5 (released 11/11/2002)
======================================

     * Fixed a bug in ll.xist.ns.specials.autoimg: Attributes were
       not converted before the size check was done (this is the same
       fix as in 1.5.5).

Changes in 2.0.4 (released 11/08/2002)
======================================

     * Fixed a regression bug in ll.xist.ns.jsp.directive and several
       documentation issues.

Changes in 2.0.3 (released 10/30/2002)
======================================

     * Fixed a few bugs in HTMLParser.
     * Added DocBook conversion for several elements in
       ll.xist.ns.doc.
     * Now the __init__.py file for the ll package is included.

Changes in 2.0.2 (released 10/21/2002)
======================================

     * Fixed a bug in Frag.__rmul__ (by reusing __mul__).
     * Fixed a bug with the backwards compatible prefix mapping:
       Defining element classes in exec processing instructions
       didn't work, because the prefixes object used for parsing
       wouldn't be updated when the namespace object is defined
       inside the processing instruction. Now using the default for
       the prefixes argument in calls to the parsing functions uses
       one global shared Prefixes instances where all the namespaces
       that are newly defined will be registered too.

Changes in 2.0.1 (released 10/17/2002)
======================================

     * Fixed xscmake.py by removing the prefix handling. OldPrefixes
       will always be used for parsing now.

Changes in 2.0 (released 10/16/2002)
====================================

     * XIST now requires at least Python 2.2.1.
     * Attribute handling has been largely rewritten. Instead of a
       class attribute attrHandlers, the attributes are now defined
       through a nested class named Attrs inside the element. This
       class must be derived from ll.xist.Element.Attrs (or one of
       its subclasses if you want to inherit attributes from this
       class). Defining attributes is done through classes nested
       inside this attributes class and derived from any of the known
       attribute classes (like TextAttr, URLAttr etc.). The class
       name will be the attribute name (and can be overwritten with a
       class attribute xmlname. This makes it possible to have
       docstrings for attributes. Furthermore it's possible to define
       an attribute default value via the class attribute default,
       allowed values for the attribute via values, which is a list
       of allowed values, and whether the attribute is required or
       not via required.
     * XIST now has real namespace support. The new class
       ll.xist.xsc.Prefixes can be used to define a mapping between
       prefixes and namespace names. This can be used for parsing and
       publishing. Namespace support is even available for entities
       and processing instruction.
     * Global attributes are supported now. Namespace modules for the
       xml and xlink namespaces have been added (and ll.xist.xsc.XML
       was moved to ll.xist.ns.xml).
     * A new namespace module for SVG 1.0 has been added:
       ll.xist.ns.svg.
     * The HTML specific parts of ll.xist.ns.specials have been split
       off into a separate module ll.xist.ns.htmlspecials.
     * Comparison of attributes with strings has been removed. You
       have to use __unicode__ or __str__ now before comparing.
     * The HTMLParser now removes unknown attributes instead of
       complaining.
     * There is a new parser class BadEntityParser, which is a SAX2
       parser that recognizes the character entities defined in HTML
       and tries to pass on unknown or malformed entities to the
       handler literally.
     * To give all nodes a chance to do something after they have
       been parsed (e.g. to prepend the base URL for URLAttr nodes),
       the parser now calls the method parsed immediately after node
       creation. This is used for the new class StyleAttr, which uses
       the CSSTokenizer, to prepend the base URL to all URLs found in
       a style attribute.
     * The pixel images have been moved to the directory px to make
       image URLs shorter.

Changes in 1.6.1 (released 08/25/2003)
======================================

     * Updated to work with newer versions of ll.ansistyle.
     * Updated the namespaces ll.xist.ns.struts_html and
       ll.xist.ns.struts_config11 to the state of Struts 1.1 final.

Changes in 1.6 (released 07/02/2003)
====================================

     * Removed the default value for the className attribute in
       ll.xist.ns.struts_config11.action.
     * Added an attribute type to
       ll.xist.ns.struts_config11.action_mapping.

Changes in 1.5.13 (released 07/01/2003)
=======================================

     * Implemented ll.xist.xsc.Namespace.__eq__, so that replacing a
       namespace in the registry really works.
     * Added an attribute target to ll.xist.ns.html.area.

Changes in 1.5.12 (released 06/17/2003)
=======================================

     * Fixed a bug in the new ll.xist.ns.jsp.

Changes in 1.5.11 (released 06/13/2003)
=======================================

     * Updated ll.xist.ns.jsp to JSP 1.2.

Changes in 1.5.10 (released 06/13/2003)
=======================================

     * Remove the checks for attributes in attributes and moved the
       publication code for the full element into a separate method.
       This allows JSP tag library namespaces to simply overwrite
       publish to publish the element even inside attributes.

Changes in 1.5.9 (released 04/30/2003)
======================================

     * Reregistering a namespace now properly overwrites the old
       version in xsc.namespaceRegistry.

Changes in 1.5.8 (released 02/27/2003)
======================================

     * ll.xist.ns.struts_config11.plug_in now allows content (as the
       DTD states).

Changes in 1.5.7 (released 11/12/2002)
======================================

     * xsc.Element.__nonzero__ can no longer fall back to
       xsc.Frag.__nonzero__.

Changes in 1.5.6 (released 11/11/2002)
======================================

     * Performance optimizations.

Changes in 1.5.5 (released 11/11/2002)
======================================

     * Fixed a bug in ll.xist.ns.specials.autoimg: Attributes were
       not converted before the size check was done.

Changes in 1.5.4 (released 09/30/2002)
======================================

     * xscmake.py now tries to strip off a trailing xsc from the
       filename before it falls back to the extension html (The
       builtin extension mapping is still tried first).

Changes in 1.5.3 (released 09/25/2002)
======================================

     * Added new processing instruction class
       ll.xist.ns.php.expression that generates a PHP print statement
       from its content.

Changes in 1.5.2 (released 09/19/2002)
======================================

     * Removed the value magic from ll.xist.ns.form.checkbox as this
       conflicted with dynamic value values.

Changes in 1.5.1 (released 09/17/2002)
======================================

     * Comparison of attributes with strings has been removed. You
       have to use __unicode__ or __str__ instead.
     * The HTMLParser now removes unknown attributes instead of
       complaining.
     * There is a new parser class BadEntityParser, which is a SAX2
       parser that recognizes the character entities defined in HTML
       and tries to pass on unknown or malformed entities to the
       handler literally.
     * To give all nodes a chance to do something after they have
       been parsed (e.g. to prepend the base URL for URLAttr nodes),
       the parser now calls the method parsed() immediately after
       node creation. This is used for the new class StyleAttr, which
       uses the CSSTokenizer, to prepend the base url to all urls
       found in a style attribute.
     * The HTMLParser now removes unknown attributes instead of
       complaining.
     * There is a new parser class BadEntityParser, which is a SAX2
       parser that recognizes the character entities defined in HTML
       and tries to pass on unknown or malformed entities to the
       handler literally.
     * To give all nodes a chance to do something after they have
       been parsed (e.g. to prepend the base URL for URLAttr nodes),
       the parser now calls the method parsed immediately after node
       creation. This is used for the new class StyleAttr, which uses
       the CSSTokenizer, to prepend to base URL to all URLs found in
       a style attribute.

Changes in 1.4.3 (released 04/29/2002)
======================================

     * New namespace module xist.ns.struts_config11 allows to parse
       and modify Struts configuration files conforming to the Struts
       1.1 DTD.

Changes in 1.4.2 (released 03/22/2002)
======================================

     * Updated xscmake.py to be compatible with the new url module.
     * xist.ns.jsp.directive_page now automatically sets the
       contentType on publishing.

Changes in 1.4.1 (released 03/21/2002)
======================================

     * Removed TidyURLInputSource. Now it's possible to pass a tidy
       flag to the remaining functions parseString, parseFile and
       parseURL to specify whether the source should be tidied.
     * To prevent an element from being registered in a Namespace the
       class attribute register can be used now. This makes it
       possible to have a name for the element even when it's not
       registered.
     * xist.ns.form elements now have all the attributes that the
       corresponding elements from xist.ns.html have.
     * Removed the old xist.url from the Windows distribution.

Changes in 1.4 (released 03/18/2002)
====================================

     * Reimplemented URL handling again. Now the new global module
       url is used for that.

Changes in 1.3.1 (released 03/14/2002)
======================================

     * Added a method pretty to Node for generating a pretty
       printable version of the node.
     * xsc.Node.name no longer is a class method, but a class
       attribute, that will be set at class instantiation time by the
       meta class.

Changes in 1.3 (released 02/12/2002)
====================================

     * Ported to Python 2.2. Node is now derived from object, Frag
       from list and there's a new class Attrs which is derived from
       dict for the attribute mappings. All presenters have been
       adapted to work with Attrs. In addition to the usual
       dictionary methods and operators Attrs has a method without
       that returns a copy of the Attrs instance with some specified
       attributes removed.
     * All the node classes now have a new method walk that generates
       all nodes in the tree using the new generator feature of
       Python 2.2.
     * Also a new method walkPath has been added that works the same
       as walk but yields the complete path to each node as a list.
     * Added a class block to xist.ns.jsp. The content of the block
       instance will simply be enclosed in a {} block. xist.ns.php
       got such a class too.
     * Added a new module xist.ns.ihtml for i-mode HTML.
     * Added new modules xist.ns.css and xist.ns.cssspecials for
       generating CSS.
     * Now the various attributes of the Converter object are
       collected in a ConverterState object and it's possible to push
       and pop those states, i.e. it's now easy to temporarily modify
       a converter object during a convert call and revert back to a
       previous state afterwards.
     * parseURL and parseTidyURL now have an additional parameter
       headers which is a list of string pairs specifying additional
       headers to be passed in with the request.
     * parseString has an additional parameter systemId which will be
       the system id of the InputSource.
     * The distribution now includes the makefile and the XML source
       files so now the distribution can rebuild ifself.
     * Various other small bugfixes and enhancements.

Changes in 1.2.5 (released 12/03/2001)
======================================

     * Added a new element contentscripttype to xist.ns.meta that
       generates a <meta http-equiv="Content-Script-Type" ...>
       element.
     * xist.ns.doc.explain now generates anchor elements for the
       class, function and method description, so now the links on
       the XIST webpages work.
     * Docstrings and documentation has been reworked. Now
       xist.ns.doc.pyref no longer implies a font change. Use the
       classes xist.ns.doc.module, xist.ns.doc.class,
       xist.ns.doc.method, xist.ns.doc.function and xist.ns.doc.arg
       to mark up your Python identifiers.
     * Added the attributes type and key to
       xist.ns.struts_config.data_source.

Changes in 1.2.4 (released 11/23/2001)
======================================

     * Added the deprecated attributes start to xist.ns.html.ol and
       value to xist.ns.html.li.

Changes in 1.2.3 (released 11/22/2001)
======================================

     * Added missing asPlainString methods to Comment and DocType.

Changes in 1.2.2 (released 11/16/2001)
======================================

     * xist.url.URL.fileSize and xist.url.URL.imageSize now use the
       warning framework to report errors.
     * There is a new presenter named CodePresenter that dumps the
       tree as Python source code.
     * The filenames of the pixel images used by
       xist.ns.specials.pixel have changed. These images are now
       included.

Changes in 1.2.1 (released 10/08/2001)
======================================

     * URLs that are completely dynamic will now be left in peace
       when parsing or publishing.

Changes in 1.2 (released 10/03/2001)
====================================

     * xist.ns.meta.keywords and xist.ns.meta.description no longer
       call asPlainString on their content. This makes it possible to
       e.g. generate the keywords via JSP:

 >>> from xist import parsers
 >>> from xist.ns import meta, jsp
 >>> s = '<keywords>' + \
 ...     '<?jsp:expression "foo"?>' + \
 ...     '</keywords>'
 >>> e = parsers.parseString(s)
 >>> print e.conv().asBytes()
 <meta name="keywords" content="<%= "foo" %>" />

     * When an element occurs inside an attribute during publishing,
       there won't be an exception raised any more. Instead the
       content of the element will be published. This fixes problems
       with abbreviation entities inside attributes.
     * xist.parsers.TidyURLInputSource now uses the new experimental
       eGenix mx Extension package, which includes a Python port of
       tidy.
     * __repr__ now uses the new class presenters.PlainPresenter
       which gives a little more info than the default __repr__.
     * URL handling has been changed again. Upto now, URLAttr had an
       additional instance attribute base, which was the "base"
       file/URL from which the attribute was parsed. Now the base URL
       will be directly incorporated into the URL. You can pass the
       base URL to all the parsing functions. Similar to that when
       publishing you can specify a base URL. All URLs in the tree
       will be output relative to this base URL. Joining URLs is now
       done via __div__ and no longer via __add__. This makes it more
       consistent with fileutils. The plan is to make URLs string
       like immutable objects and to merge them with
       fileutils.Filename.
     * xist.ns.specials.php has been moved to its own module
       (xist.ns.php). This module provided additional convenience
       processing instructions (just like xist.ns.jsp does).

Changes in 1.1.3 (released 09/17/2001)
======================================

     * The global namespace registry now keeps a sequential list of
       all registered namespaces, which will be used by the parser
       when searching for names. This gives a predictable search
       order even without using Namespaces and its pushNamespace
       method: modules imported last will be searched first.
     * Processing instructions are now allowed inside attributes when
       publishing.
     * xist.ns.docbooklite has been renamed to xist.ns.doc. It can
       now generate HTML and Docbook output and has improved a lot.
       The XIST web pages now use this for automatic documentation
       generation. The doc example has been removed.
     * xist.url.URL now has a new method info that returns the
       headers for the file/URL.
     * xist.url.URL now has a methods fileSize and imageSize too.
     * xist.ns.jsp.directive_page now has new attribute session.

Changes in 1.1.2 (released 08/21/2001)
======================================

     * __repr__ now uses the new class presenters.PlainPresenter
       which gives a little more info than the default __repr__.

Changes in 1.1.1 (released 08/01/2001)
======================================

     * Small bugfix in presenters.strProcInst
     * fixed xist.ns.struts_html.option to allow content

Changes in 1.1 (released 07/19/2001)
====================================

     * Sequences in constructor arguments for Frag and Element are
       again expanded and it's again possible to pass dictionaries in
       an Element constructor to specify attributes. As sequences are
       always unpacked, the method extend is gone. This works for
       append and insert too.
     * Node and Frag implement __mul__ and __rmul__, so you can do
       stuff like:

 html.br()*5

       This returns a Frag with five times to same node.

     * Arguments for the converter constructor can be passed to
       xist.xsc.Node.conv now, so it's possible to do stuff like
       this:

 from xist.ns import code
 print code.Eval("return converter.lang") \
    .conv(lang="en").asBytes()

       which will print en.

     * The option XHTML for the publishers has been changed to
       lowercase.
     * xist.ns.html.html will automatically generate a lang and
       xml:lang attribute when the converter has a language set.

Changes in 1.0 (released 06/18/2001)
====================================

     * New module for WML 1.3.
     * The publishing interface has changed internally and publishing
       should be faster now.
     * Publishers now support a new parameter: usePrefix, which
       specifies if namespace prefixes should be output for the
       element names.
     * Part of the implementation of the publishing stuff has been
       moved to C, so now you'll need a C compiler to install XIST.
     * When publishing ", it will now only be replaced with &quot;
       inside attributes.
     * All the asHTML methods now have an additional argument
       converter. This makes it possible to implement different
       processing modes or stages for new elements. All currently
       implemented elements and entities ignore this argument, but
       pass it on in the call to their childrens' asHTML method. As
       the name asHTML no longer makes sense, asHTML has been renamed
       to convert.
     * There is now a tool dtd2xsc.py in the scripts directory that
       creates a skeleton XIST module from a DTD (this requires
       xmlproc from the PyXML package).
     * New preliminary module for DocBook 4.12. (Incomplete: convert
       methods and Unicode character entities are missing; any
       volunteers for implementing 375 classes?)
     * New module ruby.py that implements the W3C Ruby draft.
     * sql.py has been removed from XIST, but is available as a
       separate module.
     * The parsing interface has been changed. Parsing is now done
       with the functions parseFile, parseString, parseURL and
       parseTidyURL in the module parsers. It's now possible to
       specify which parser should be used for parsing by passing a
       SAX2 parser instance to any of these functions. XIST now
       includes a rudimentary SAX2 driver for sgmlop and a
       rudimentary HTML parser that emits SAX2 events.
     * The python-quotes example has been updated to work with expat.
     * Added a new example: media.
     * All abbreviation entities have been moved to a new module
       abbr.py.
     * All the modules that provide new elements and entitites have
       been moved to a subpackage ns.
     * Frag and Element now have new methods sorted, reversed,
       filtered and shuffled that return sorted, reversed, filtered
       and shuffled versions of the Frag/Element object.
     * New namespace modules ns/jsp.py and ns/struts_html.py have
       been added that allow you to use JSP and Struts tags with
       XIST.
     * A new method asText was added, that returns the node as a
       formatted plain ASCII text (this requires that w3m is
       installed.)
     * make.py has been renamed to xscmake.py and moved to the
       scripts directory, it will be installed as a callable script
       with python setup.py install_scripts.
     * xscmake.py has a new option --files/-f. The argument is a file
       containing a list of filenames (one name per line) that should
       be converted.
     * xscmake.py has a new option -r/--parser for specifying which
       parser to use. Allowed values are sgmlop and expat.
     * xscmake.py has a new option -n/--namespace that can be used
       for appending Namespace objects to the Namespaces object used
       by xscmake.py.

 xscmake.py -n html -n spam eggs.xsc

       With this call the parser will find element classes from the
       module with the prefix name spam before those from html and
       those before anything else.

     * xist.url.URL no longer has an attribute ext. file and ext are
       merged.
     * The special treatment of sequences as constructor arguments to
       Frag and Element has been removed, so XIST will no longer
       remove one level of nesting. If you still want that, use a *
       argument.
     * Frag and Element now have a new method mapped, that
       recursively maps the nodes through a function. This is like
       convert but via an external function.
     * Attribute handling has been improved thanks to a suggestion by
       Hartmut Goebel: Element.__getitem__ now always works as long
       as the attribute name is legal. If the attribute is not set,
       an empty attribute will be returned. All empty attributes will
       be considered as being not set and so hasAttr returns 0 for
       them, and publish doesn't publish them. This simplifies
       several very common cases:

          * Copying an attribute from one element to another works
            regardless of whether the attribute is set or not;
          * Testing for an attributes presence can now be done much
            simpler: if element["attrname"] instead of if
            element.hasAttr("attrname") (which still works, and
            should be a little faster);
          * When you construct a DOM tree and the presence or absence
            of an attribute is tied to a condition, you can construct
            the attribute in advance and use it afterwards in the
            tree construction:

 if condition:
    align = "right"
 else:
    align = None
 node = html.div("spam", align=align)

            So, when the condition is false, the node will not have
            the attribute align set.

     * xist.ns.cond.If (and xist.ns.cond.ElIf) can now be used to
       test for attributes of the converter. I.e. it's possible to
       write the following XML:

 <if lang="en">Title
 <elif lang="de">Überschrift
 </if>

     * URL handling has be completely changed and is much, much
       simpler now. There are no more path markers. To specify an URL
       that is relative to the current directory use the scheme root
       (e.g. root:main.css).

Changes in 0.4.7 (released 11/24/2000)
======================================

     * Fixed a bug in the entity handling.
     * Added a few deprecated elements and attributes to the html
       module.
     * Improved the publishing of attributes. Now all attribute
       values will be published. For boolean attributes no value will
       be published for XHTML==0 and the attribute name will be used
       for XHTML==1 or XHTML==2.
     * Element.compact now works (better) ;).
     * Incorparated many bug fixes from Hartmut Goebel.
     * Implemented xsc.Element.copyDefaultAttrs, which copies unset
       attributes over from a dictionary (simplifies implementing
       specials.plaintable and specials.plainbody)
     * providers.Provider.pushNamespace now handles multiple
       arguments which may be Namespace objects or modules (in which
       case, module.namespace will be pushed)
     * providers.Providers.popNamespace can now pop multiple
       namespaces at once.
     * providers.TidyURIProvider now uses os.popen3 for piping the
       file through tidy, so now there will be no more temporary
       files. The call to tidy now includes options that hopefully
       make the output more suited to XIST.
     * Incorparated a new url.py by Hartmut Goebel, that fixes many
       problem (e.g. optimizing http://server/foo/bar/../../baz.gif
       now works.)
     * make.py includes a new option --path for adding directories to
       sys.path.

Changes in 0.4.6 (released 11/03/2000)
======================================

     * Now uses sgmlop.XMLParser instead of sgmlop.SGMLParser, so
       case is preserved.
     * Fixed another regression from the URL to string conversion
       change.

Changes in 0.4.5 (released 11/01/2000)
======================================

     * Converting URLs to nodes is now done in ToNode, so URL objects
       can be used everywhere.
     * Fixed a few bugs in Text._strtext and URLAttr._str.

Changes in 0.4.4 (releases 10/27/2000)
======================================

     * Now testing if characters can be encoded with the specified
       encoding is done directy. This means, that escaping
       unencodable characters now works even with exotic encodings
       (tested with JapaneseCodecs-1.0.1.tar.gz).
     * The URLAttr constructor now can handle a single parameter of
       the type URL.
     * The URL to string conversion function have changed:
       URL.asString returns the URL with path markers,
       URL.asPlainString returns the URL without path markers.
     * Added the i18n attribute to the font element.
     * Fixed the clashes between the class names for the elements and
       entities sub and sup in html.py.
     * Several small enhancements and bug fixes contributed by
       Hartmut Goebel.

Changes in 0.4.3 (released 10/19/2000)
======================================

     * Now processing instruction classes are registered in the same
       way as elements and entities are.
     * The leaf nodes (Text, Comment, ProcInst) are now considered
       immutable. This means that their asHTML method can simply
       return self, because now those nodes can be shared between
       trees. Functionality for manipulation the objects is provided
       by a mixin class very similar to UserString. All this results
       in a speedup of about 10% for the python-quotes example.
     * Small optimizations in the asHTML methods of Element and Frag
       optimized away many calls to append, extend and ToNode and
       result in a speedup of about 30% for the python-quotes
       example. One consequence of this is that Null objects will no
       longer be ignored.

Changes in 0.4.2 (released 09/24/2000)
======================================

     * New elements keywords and description in meta.py.
     * Fixed a bug in Namespace.register, now setting name=None to
       prevent an element from being registered works again.

Changes in 0.4.1 (released 09/21/2000)
======================================

     * A new module named meta.py has been created, that simplifies
       generating meta tags.
     * Various small bugfixes.

Changes in 0.4 (released 09/19/2000)
====================================

     * XIST now requires at least Python 2.0b1.
     * A new bugfixed version of the sgmlop source is available from
       the FTP site.
     * XIST now completely supports Unicode. For output any encoding
       known to Python can be used, so now you can output your HTML
       in ASCII, Latin-1, UTF-8, UTF-16, ...
     * All publishers have been updated to support Unicode. The
       publishing interface has been streamlined (encoding and XHTML
       parameters are now attributes of the publisher).
     * asString will now always return a Unicode string. If you want
       a byte string use asBytes instead, where the encoding can be
       specified as an argument.
     * There an additional publisher class FilePublisher, which can
       be used for publishing to a file (or anything else that has a
       write and a writelines method, and is supported by the stream
       writer available through codecs.lookup).
     * Element and attribute names are no longer converted to
       lowercase. If you have an attribute name which clashes with a
       Python keyword (e.g. class) append an underscore (_), which
       will be removed before accessing the attribute. This is the
       "official" Python method for handling these cases.
     * Elements and entities are no longer registered one by one. Now
       you can build Namespace objects which are used for searching
       and there are pushNamespace and popNamespace functions in
       XSC.xsc. For more info, see the source.
     * Image size calculation has been removed from html.img and
       html.input. Use specials.autoimg and specials.autoinput for
       that.
     * __getitem__, __setitem__ and __delitem of Frag and Element now
       accepts a list as an argument. The method will be applied
       recursively, i.e. e[[0, 1, "foo", 2] is the same as
       e[0][1]["foo"][2].
     * The deprecated module db.py no longer exists. Useful functions
       and elements from db.py have been moved to sql.py and form.py
       respectively.
     * When using xsc.make the encoding and XHTML parameters to use
       can now be specified on the command line (e.g. --encoding
       utf-8 --xhtml 2)
     * Handling of multiline <?xsc-eval?> and <?xsc-exec?> has been
       enhanced, although, XIST will not be able to guess the correct
       indentation in all cases. As a workarround simply add a Python
       comment to the beginning:

 <?xsc-exec
    for i in xrange(10):
       do(i)
 ?>

       won't work

 <?xsc-exec
    #
    for i in xrange(10):
       do(i)
 ?>

       will.

     * Make functionality has been moved to make.py, as certain
       modules can't be used as the main script, because reimporting
       them in processing instructions won't work. Now you can simply
       call

 make.py --import xist.html --import spam eggs.xsc

     * There is a new module cond.py, that contains elements that can
       be used for conditionals:

 <?xsc-exec a=42?>
 <if cond="a==21">
    <b>foo</b>
 <elif cond="a==42"/>
    <i>bar</i>
 <else/>
    baz
 </if>

Changes in 0.3.9 (released 08/10/2000)
======================================

     * sgmlop will now be found either via import sgmlop or via from
       xml.parsers import sgmlop.

Changes in 0.3.8 (released 07/14/2000)
======================================

     * Fixed a bug in URLAttr.publish, which prevented URLAttr from
       working at all.

Changes in 0.3.7 (released 07/06/2000)
======================================

     * Fixed a bug in html.img and html.input. Now image size
       calculation works again.

Changes in 0.3.6 (released 07/04/2000)
======================================

     * Fixed a bug in Node._matches, which resulted in a non working
       find.

Changes in 0.3.5 (released 07/02/2000)
======================================

     * The documentation example has been enhanced. Now documenting
       methods works.
     * When the member elementname in the element class is set before
       calling registerElement, this element name will be used for
       the element. This allows custom names even when using
       registerAllElements.
     * Comparison of scheme and server in URLs is done case
       insensitive (as RFC 2068 requires.)
     * Image size calculation is now done in asString and not in
       asHTML. This allows to write faster code. Old method:

 e = html.div(html.img(...),gurk.hurz()).asHTML().asString()

       New method

 e = html.div(html.img(...),gurk.hurz().asHTML()).asString()

     * Image size calculation is now done for <input type="image">.
       The size attribute is set to the image width.
     * Manipulating the path in an URL is now done via the usual
       __setitem__/__getitem__ stuff, which keeps the path in a
       consistent state.

 >>> from xist.URL import URL
 >>> u = URL("/foo/*/../bar/baz.gif")
 >>> del u[1]
 >>> u
 URL(scheme='server', path=['bar'], file='baz', ext='gif')

     * findNodes (which has been shortened to find) has an additional
       argument test, which can be a test function that will be
       called when the node passes all other tests.
     * asString no longer generates a string directly, but uses the
       new method publish, which has an additional argument
       publisher, to which the strings to be output are passed.

Changes in 0.3.4 (released 05/31/2000)
======================================

     * Location information is now copied over in clone, asHTML and
       compact where appropriate, so you know even in the HTML tree
       where something came from.
     * xsc.repransi can now have three values:

          * 0: coloring is off
          * 1: coloring is on for a dark background
          * 2: coloring is on for a light background

       All repransi variables are now arrays with two strings, the
       first for dark, the second for light.

Changes in 0.3.3 (released 05/30/2000)
======================================

     * The workaround for the trailing CDATA bug in sgmlop has been
       removed, so now you'll need a newer version of sgmlop
       (included in PyXML 0.5.5.1)

Changes before 0.3.3
====================

     * These changes predate written history.
