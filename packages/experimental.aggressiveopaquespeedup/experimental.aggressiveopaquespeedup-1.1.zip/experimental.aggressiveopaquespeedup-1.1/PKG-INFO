Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This path improve overall performance of Plone. It remove opaqueitems feature
        from CMF (just keep talkback support)
        
        I have discover this issue by profiling just a simple javascript file fetch
        throw Plone document html page and discuss it throw CMF mailing list:
        http://mail.zope.org/pipermail/zope-cmf/2009-August/028559.html
        
        The result is 25% better on the total time spend in the request. Becarefull if
        you use a third part product that use opaqueitems and make me know if you it is,
        I will add it to this page. At the moment only talkback use it and are supported.
