simplon.currency Installation
=======================

 * When you're reading this you have probably already run 
   ``easy_install simplon.currency``. Find out how to install setuptools
   (and EasyInstall) here:

 * Create a file called ``simplon.currency-configure.zcml`` in the
   ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
   should only contain this::

       <include package="simplon.currency" />
