Description: Currency support for Plone
        ==========================
        
        This package adds currency handling support to a Plone site. Site managers
        can enable any of the standard currencies in a site and manage the currency
        rates.
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        This package is made to be used as a normal python package within Zope 2.10
        and needs Plone 3.0 or later.
        
        First you need to install this package in the python path for your
        Zope instance. This can be done by installing it in either your system
        path packages or in the lib/python directory in your Zope instance.
        
        After installing the package it needs to be registered in your Zope instance.
        This can be done by putting a simplon.plone.currency-configure.zcml file in the
        etc/pakage-includes directory with this content::
        
        <include package="simplon.plone.currency" />
        
        or, alternatively, you can add that line to the configure.zcml in a
        package or Product that is already registered.
        
        Installing with buildout
        ------------------------
        
        If you are using `buildout`_ to manage your instance installing
        simplon.plone.currency is even simpler. You can install it by adding
        it to the eggs line for your instance::
        
        [instance]
        eggs = simplon.plone.currency
        zcml = simplon.plone.currency
        
        The last line tells buildout to generate a zcml snippet that tells Zope
        to configure simplon.plone.currency.
        
        .. _buildout: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout
        
        
        Managing currencies
        -------------------
        
        In order to manage currencies you first need to install the package
        in your Plone site. You can do this using the standard Add/Remove Products
        page in the Plone site setup. You need to install the 'Currency support'
        product.
        
        After installing the package in your site a new Currencies option
        will be available in the site setup. This is where you can manage your
        currencies.
        
        Currencies can be added using the 'Add currency' button. You only
        need to select the currency and the conversion rate: the currency
        description and symbol will be configured automatically.
        
        You have to select a single currency as the 'main currency'. This is the
        currency against which all conversion rates are defined. You can not
        edit or remove the main currency: its rate is fixed to 1.0 as reference
        value for all rates.
