Description: silvainstall
        ============
        
        Easily install Silva >= 2.0.
        
        Do install the latest **experimental** release of Silva using
        `silvainstall`, do:
        
        easy_install silvainstall # you might want to do this as root
        
        MKZO=~/lib/Zope-2.10/bin/mkzopeinstance.py
        INSTANCE_HOME=~/mysilva2.0
        
        silvainstall $INSTANCE_HOME -m $MKZO
        
        That's it!  Just make sure that you set ``MKZO`` and ``INSTANCE_HOME``
        according to where your ``mkzopeinstance.py`` script is and where you
        want to create your instance respectively.
        
        
        The development version is available in a `Subversion repository
        <https://infrae.com/svn/silvainstall/trunk#egg=silvainstall-dev>`_.
