0.3 (2010-01-30)
----------------

 * When displaying an edit form for a file that does not exist,
   use the return value of mimetypes.guess_type as the default
   mimetype for the file in the form. If no guessable mimetype
   is found, the default is 'text/html'.

   This behavior can be overridden by subclassing SvnWikiView
   and implementing a custom `new_file_default_mimetype_policy`
   method. The method should take a `request` argument.


0.2 (2010-01-26)
----------------

 * BZR repositories are now supported. This is much faster than
   SVN. To use, simply add 'svenweb.repo_type=bzr' to your
   paste.deploy configuration.

 * Added a WSGI middleware filter to set a response's Content-type
   header based on the versioned mimetype property of a resource.
   It can be used independent of the rest of svenweb, for example
   if you want to publish the current contents of your versioned
   resources with a static file server. Use like

       [filter:contenttype]
       use = egg:svenweb#content_type
       checkout_dir = /path/to_your/checkout/
       default_content_type = text/plain
       repo_type = bzr

    The 'repo_type' and 'default_content_type' settings are optional.


0.1.1 (2010-01-03)
