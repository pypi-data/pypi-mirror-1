        You can install it with ``easy_install nose-pathmunge``
        
        What It Does
        ------------
        
        nose-pathmunge is a plugin to the nose test framework which provides a method
        to add directories to the sys.path of nose, which is inherited by the tests
        running within nose.
        
        This itch stems from in many of my own cases, the need to add modules to a
        given run (dependencies) that I don't want to install because they're synced
        from a source control system, and change frequently.
        
        This plugin is extremely simple. It's meant to be.
        
        Usage
        ----------
        
        Usage is simple - install the package, and then execute nosetests like this::
        
        nosetests --with-path=/home/jesse/src --with-path=/other/dir
        
        Remember the rules when appending directories to your path - you should add
        the directory above a module - not the module directory itself, and there
        needs to be a valid __init__.py file. For example, the following project
        layout in subversion::
        
        myproj/
        src/
        mymodule/
        __init__.py
        foobar.py
        
        You would add this like this::
        
        nosetests --with-path=/home/jesse/src/myproj/src
        
        This would add ``mymodule/...`` to the sys.path for the tests to be able to
        import.
        
        Command line options
        --------------------
        
        After it is installed, the plugin adds the following command line flags to
        nosetests::
        
        --with-path=TESTCONFIG  Additional directories to add to the nose sys.path
        [NOSE_ADDITIONAL_PATHS]
        
        You can pass in as many paths as you like. I suggest 3, as that's a pleasant
        number.
