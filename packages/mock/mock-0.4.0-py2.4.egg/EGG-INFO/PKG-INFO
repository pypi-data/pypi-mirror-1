Description: There are already several Python mocking libraries available, so why another one?
        
        Most mocking libraries follow the 'record -> replay' pattern of mocking. I
        prefer the 'action -> assertion' pattern, which is more readable and intuitive
        particularly when working with the Python `unittest module
        <http://docs.python.org/lib/module-unittest.html>`_. For a discussion of the
        merits of the two approaches, see `Mocking, Patching, Stubbing: all that Stuff
        <http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/articles/mocking.shtml>`_.
        
        ``mock`` provides a core ``Mock`` class that is intended to reduce the need to
        create a host of trivial stubs throughout your test suite. After performing an
        action, you can make assertions about which methods / attributes were used and
        arguments they were called with. You can also specify return values and set
        specific attributes in the normal way.
        
        It also provides a ``patch`` decorator that handles patching module and class
        level attributes within the scope of a test, along with ``sentinel`` for
        creating unique objects.
