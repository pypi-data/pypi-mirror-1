Introduction
============

``mock`` provides a core :class:`mock.Mock` class that is intended to reduce the need to
create a host of trivial stubs throughout your test suite. After performing an
action, you can make assertions about which methods / attributes were used and
arguments they were called with. You can also specify return values and set
specific attributes in the normal way.

It also provides a :func:`mock.patch` decorator that handles patching module and class
level attributes within the scope of a test, along with :const:`mock.sentinel` for 
creating unique objects.

Most mocking libraries follow the 'record -> replay' pattern of mocking. I
prefer the 'action -> assertion' pattern, which is more readable and intuitive;
particularly when working with the Python `unittest module
<http://docs.python.org/lib/module-unittest.html>`_. For a discussion of the
merits of the two approaches, see `Mocking, Patching, Stubbing: all that Stuff
<http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/articles/mocking.shtml>`_.
