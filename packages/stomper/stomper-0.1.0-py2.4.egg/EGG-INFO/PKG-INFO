Description: 
        This is a python client implementation of the STOMP protocol. It aims
        to be transport layer neutral. This module provides functions to create
        and parse STOMP messages in a programatic fashion.
        
        The examples package contains two examples using twisted as the transport
        framework. Other frameworks can be used and I may add other examples as
        time goes on.
        
        The STOMP protocol specification maybe found here:
        
        * http://stomp.codehaus.org/Protocol
        
        I've looked and the stomp client by Jason R. Briggs and have based the message
        generation on how his client did it. The client can be found at the follow
        address however it isn't a dependancy.

        In testing this library I run against ActiveMQ project. The server runs
        in java, however its fairly standalone and easy to set up. The projects
        page is here:
