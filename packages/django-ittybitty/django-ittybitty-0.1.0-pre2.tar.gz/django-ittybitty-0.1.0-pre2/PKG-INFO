Description: 
        This application offers those with Django-powered sites to have their very own
        URL-shortening capabilities with great ease. For an idea of what "URL-shortening"
        means, have a gander at http://mashable.com/2008/01/08/url-shortening-services/
        or just Google "url shortening". It's kind of a big deal all of the sudden.
        
        Why should you use this when all of those services already exist online? Maybe
        it's just me, but I don't like relying on 3rd party servers in order for my
        site to function, and that includes relying on other servers for people to
        follow a link to my site. With this application installed, you no longer need
        to worry about downtime on those other servers affecting your traffic at all.
        If people can't get to your site using the shortened URLs generated by this
        application, you probably have bigger problems (ie your site itself is down).
