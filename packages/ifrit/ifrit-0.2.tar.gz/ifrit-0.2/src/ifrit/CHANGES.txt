ifrit Package Changelog

  'ifrit-0.2' (2007/02/11)

    - Enabled selection of the parser (via its utility name) when creating
      a path adapter via ZCML.

    - Added sample utility implementations for lxml's etree and objectify
      (the default 'elementree.ElementTree.parse' works fine, too).

    - Broke the hard dependency on elementtree / lxml, indirecting the
      parser lookup through a utilty.

    - CVS tag, 'ifrit-0_2'
