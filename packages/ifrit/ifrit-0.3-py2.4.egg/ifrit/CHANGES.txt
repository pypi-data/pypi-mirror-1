ifrit Package Changelog

  'ifrit-0.3' (2007/02/17)

    - Added ZCML directive for creating traversal adapters.

    - Removed the marker interface stuff from "path adapters":  having the
      publishing traversal adapter mark the wrapper is all we really need.

    - Added a factory for ElementTraversalAdapters to allow marking specific
      traversal targets with interfaces.  The returned objects will actually
      be proxies, because some nodes (those returned by lxml.objectify) can't
      have intertfaces stored on the instance.

    - Added an ElementTraversalAdapter to permit URL traversal into a
      node;  fall back to view lookup if sub-node lookup fails.

    - Added 'multiple' argument to ElementMaker and related ZCML:  if passed
      as True, the maker returns a sequence of nodes, each implementing the
      marker, rather than a single node.

    - CVS tag, 'ifrit-0_3'

  'ifrit-0.2' (2007/02/11)

    - Enabled selection of the parser (via its utility name) when creating
      a path adapter via ZCML.

    - Added sample utility implementations for lxml's etree and objectify
      (the default 'elementree.ElementTree.parse' works fine, too).

    - Broke the hard dependency on elementtree / lxml, indirecting the
      parser lookup through a utilty.

    - CVS tag, 'ifrit-0_2'

  'ifrit-0.1' (2007/02/08)

    - Initial release

    - CVS tag, 'ifrit-0_1'
