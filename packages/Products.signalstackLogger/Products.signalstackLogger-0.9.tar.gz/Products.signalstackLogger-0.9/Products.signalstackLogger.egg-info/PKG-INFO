Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package is based on Products.signalstack.
        
        The one difference from the original product is a change to where
        the thread dump is output.  This version of signalstack uses
        the python logging facilities to output the thread dump, rather
        than printing to stdout.  Certain production setups don't have
        access to stdout, i.e. when `zopectl start` is used.
        
        This change allows access to the thread dump when stdout is not
        accessible, since in addition to writing to stdout, the thread dump
        is also written to the zope event log.  '
        
        Products.signalstackLogger is triggered in the same was as the
        original, i.e. by sending *USR1* to a Zope2 instance.
        
        The original Products.signalstack is intended to be used with
        supervisord, which retains stdout.
        
        From the original README:
        -------------------------
        This package is a simple debugging tool for Zope 2 instances that are
        stuck. Unlike the `z3c.deadlockdebugger`_ and `DeadlockDebugger`_ this
        package also works if all threads in an instance are stuck.
        
        If you send the *USR1* signal to a Zope2 instance with Products.signalstack
        installed it will dump a stracktrace of all threads on the console.
