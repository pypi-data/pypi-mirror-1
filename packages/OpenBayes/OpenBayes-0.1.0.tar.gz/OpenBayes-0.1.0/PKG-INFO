Description: OpenBayes is a library that allows users to easily create a bayesian network and perform inference on it.
        It is mainly inspired from the Bayes Net Toolbox (BNT) which is available for MatLAB,
        but uses python as a base language which provides many benefits : fast execution, portability
        and ease to use and maintain. Any inference engine can be implemented by inheriting a base
        class. In the same way, new distributions can be added to the package by simply defining the
        data contained in the distribution and some basic probabilistic operations.
        
        The project is mature enough to be used for static bayesian networks and we are currently
        developping the dynamical aspect.
