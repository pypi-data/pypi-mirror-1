About
=====

This extension  allow Mscgen_\ -formatted :abbr:`MSC` diagrams to be included in
Sphinx-generated documents inline.

Mscgen_ is a small program (inspired by `Graphviz Dot`_) that parses
:abbr:`MSC` descriptions and produces images as the output. :abbr:`MSC`\ s are
a way of representing entities and interactions over some time period, very
similar to UML sequence diagrams.

.. _`Graphviz Dot`: http://www.graphviz.org/


Usage
=====

The Mscgen_ program is used to render the :abbr:`MSC`, so you should refer
to its documentation for details on how to specify the diagram. You should
have the program installed for this extension to work. If you need LaTeX
output, you'll need the epstopdf_ program too.

.. _epstopdf: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/epstopdf/

This extension adds the ``mscgen`` and ``msc`` directives. The former let
you specify a full diagram, the later let you omit the ``msc { ... }``
bits so you can jump right to the important stuff.


Example
-------

The most common way to inline a :abbr:`MSC` diagram is to use the ``msc``
directive::

   .. msc::

      hscale = "2";

      a,b,c;

      a->b [ label = "ab()" ] ;
      b->c [ label = "bc(TRUE)"];
      c=>c [ label = "process()" ];

If you need full control over the :abbr:`MSC` diagram you can use the
``mscgen`` directive::

   .. mscgen::

      msc {
         hscale = "2";

         a,b,c;

         a->b [ label = "ab()" ] ;
         b->c [ label = "bc(TRUE)"];
         c=>c [ label = "process()" ];
      }


Configuration
=============

A few configuration options are added (all optional):

``mscgen``:
   location of the *mscgen* program. It's expected to be in the PATH by
   default. The full path, including the binary, should be given if that's
   not the case.

``mscgen_args``:
   extra command line arguments for *mscgen* (should be a list of
   strings).

``mscgen_epstopdf``:
   location of the *epstopdf* program. It's expected to be in the PATH by
   default. The full path, including the binary, should be given if that's
   not the case.

``mscgen_epstopdf_args``:
   extra command line arguments for *epstopdf* (should be a list of
   strings).


Requirements
============

* mscgen_ (tested with 0.14).
* epstopdf_ for LaTeX/PDF output.
