        *************
        
        If you want to use YUI in Grok or Zope, you add a dependency to this
        package in your setup.py. You can then import from ``hury.yui`` and
        ``need`` the resources you want to use.
        
        This is a very thin integration layer between Zope and
        ``hurry.yui``. Right now it only publishes the YUI code
        (``yui-build``) in ``hurry.yui`` as a Zope 3 resource directory.
