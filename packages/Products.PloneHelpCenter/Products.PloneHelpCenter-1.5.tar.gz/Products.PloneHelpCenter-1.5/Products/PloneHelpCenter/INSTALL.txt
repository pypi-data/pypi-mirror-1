Requirements
------------

PloneHelpCenter requires:

* Plone 2.5 or later


Installation
============

See the `Installing an Add-on Product`_ tutorial for more detailed product installation instructions.

.. _Installing an Add-on Product: http://plone.org/documentation/tutorial/third-party-products/installing

Optional
--------

AddRemoveWidget -- PLEASE NOTE: if AddRemoveWidget is installed
as a Zope product, you *must* also install it in Plone. If it is
present without being installed, errors will occur.


Installing with buildout
------------------------

If you are using `buildout`_ to manage your instance installing Ploneboard
is very simple. You can install it by adding it to the eggs line for your
instance::

  [instance]
  eggs = Products.PloneHelpCenter


If another egg package depends on Products.Ploneboard you do not need
to specify anything in the buildout configuration: buildout will detect this
automatically.

After updating the configuration you need to run the ''bin/buildout'', which
will take care of updating your system.

.. _buildout: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout

Installing without buildout
---------------------------

Move (or symlink) the ``PloneHelpCenter`` folder of this project
(``Products.PloneHelpCenter/Products/PloneHelpCenter``) into the ``Products`` directory of
the Zope instance it has to be installed for, and restart the server.

You may also download a traditional tarball that you unpack into Products
from http://plone.org/products/PloneHelpCenter .
