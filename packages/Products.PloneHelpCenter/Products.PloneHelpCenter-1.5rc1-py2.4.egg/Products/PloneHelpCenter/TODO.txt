Bugs

    o Content type portlets ('latest faqs', 'latest how-tos', etc.) don't actually 
      sort by most recent.

Clean-up

Process improvements
--------------------

Template improvements
---------------------

    o In addition to appearing at the top level (helpcenter_view) the 
      documentation search box should also appear in the sub level view
      (howtofolder_view, etc) but not the document view (howto_view).

New functionality
-----------------

    o Pre-defined values for existing content type fields.

        - In-your-face guideline we want to encourage people to follow.

        - Show up as text in the body of a newly created document.

        - Vague example: http://www.openplans.org/projects/plone-documentation/an-example-of-a-pre-defined-structure/

    o Rate-able doc types. 

        - More than just a Y/N type thing but at the same time it needs to be short.

        - Rates if the document is useful, correct, tells you what you thought it was going to, etc.

        - Extends existing PHC stats tools to make it easier to search for 
          "bad" documentation that is flagged up.

        - Option to trace back who made what rating so we can contact that 
          person and discuss. Facilities to link these traces together and show 
          traces that a document belongs to.

        - Official blessing indicator. For when there are two docs on the same 
          subject, to indicate which one is preferred.

    o Alerts.

        - Notification sent via email when a document is submitted for review or
          published.
    
        - Configurable, to be sent to either a mailing-list or individual.


    o Automated Review Cycle
        - Some sort of cycle that every, let say, 6 months, boots out an email to 
            the author of a doc and says, hey review this!                                                                                  
    o Trails. 

        - Take some smaller pieces of documentation and link them together to
          form something bigger.

        - See initial idea here: http://www.openplans.org/projects/plone-documentation/map/ 

        - Should be prioritized last in this TODO list because it needs to be
          thought about carefully before implementing. There are already a lot of 
          content types in the PHC. For now, possibly use the reference manual type for
          this which should be more than adequate. We may call it a "trail", but to the reader
          it's just another style of constructing a reference on some topic.
