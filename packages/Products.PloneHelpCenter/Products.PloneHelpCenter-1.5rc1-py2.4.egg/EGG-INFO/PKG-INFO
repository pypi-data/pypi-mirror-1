Description: ========================
        Products.PloneHelpCenter
        ========================
        
        Overview
        ========
        
        Plone Help Center is an application designed to aid the documentation of
        Plone, and is used on plone.org to categorize and keep documentation up to
        date. It should be usable for documenting other open source products
        (such as Plone Product add-ons) or even for other documentation projects.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Plone Help Center has inline documentation, just add a help center.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        PloneHelpCenter requires:
        
        * Plone 2.5 or later
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        See the `Installing an Add-on Product`_ tutorial for more detailed product installation instructions.
        
        .. _Installing an Add-on Product: http://plone.org/documentation/tutorial/third-party-products/installing
        
        Optional
        --------
        
        - AddRemoveWidget -- PLEASE NOTE: if AddRemoveWidget is installed
        as a Zope product, you *must* also install it in Plone. If it is
        present without being installed, errors will occur.
        
        
        Installing with buildout
        ------------------------
        
        If you are using `buildout`_ to manage your instance installing Ploneboard
        is very simple. You can install it by adding it to the eggs line for your
        instance::
        
        [instance]
        eggs = Products.PloneHelpCenter
        
        
        If another egg package depends on Products.Ploneboard you do not need
        to specify anything in the buildout configuration: buildout will detect this
        automatically.
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run the ''bin/buildout'', which
        will take care of updating your system.
        
        .. _buildout: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout
        
        Installing without buildout
        ---------------------------
        
        Move (or symlink) the ``PloneHelpCenter`` folder of this project
        (``Products.PloneHelpCenter/Products/PloneHelpCenter``) into the ``Products`` directory of
        the Zope instance it has to be installed for, and restart the server.
        
        You may also download a traditional tarball that you unpack into Products
        from http://plone.org/products/PloneHelpCenter .Credits

        HISTORY
        =======
        
        History of changes to PHC (name of developer listed in brackets)::
        
        PloneHelpCenter 1.5
        
        Beta 7
        
        - Add link to api.plone.org in list of additional resources. This
        fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7898.
        [vinsci]
        
        Beta 6
        
        - Restored getAudiencesVocab method to PHCFolder. It had been accidentally
        deleted in a recen refactoring. Fixes #93.
        [kteague]
        
        - The latest Archetypes changed the defaults for text fields, creating the
        possibility that content types other than plain text might be allowed
        for some text-only fields. Fixed by specifying allowable and default
        content types. Fixes #99.
        [kteague]
        
        Beta 5 and earlier
        
        - Remove "statistics" tab from subfolders. I don't know if it
        was ever meant to be there, but it's useless and doesn't work.
        [stevem]
        
        - Move presentation support from PHCFolder.py to browser view.
        [stevem]
        
        - Items without sections were not showing in phcfolder_view.
        [stevem]
        
        - Revise utils.discussionNotify() to use secureSend.
        [stevem]
        
        - Plone 3 doesn't allow discussion of content without dynamic layouts,
        so migrate all the FTIs to dynamic view.
        [stevem]
        
        - Fixed issue #41, Content accessible when container is hidden.
        [stevem]
        
        - Consolidate ad-hoc topic css into stylesheet. (issue #78)
        [stevem]
        
        - Made it possible to use non-ASCII section titles (issues #80, #81, #83).
        [stevem]
        
        - Started building browser support; shifted much of the presentation
        logic for the PHC views to browser views.
        [stevem]
        
        - Fixed broken install under 2.5.x.
        [stevem]
        
        - A bug in CMF 1.2's DiscussionTool prevents setting a default
        allow_discussion via class attribute. (Archetypes used to work
        around this by catching the exception. That was lost in Archetypes
        1.5. Until fixed, commented out the code that sets allow_discussion.
        [stevem]
        
        - Add rudimentary test for comment mailing.
        [stevem]
        
        - Test and install cleanup targetting Plone 3.
        [stevem]
        
        PloneHelpCenter 1.0
        
        - Hide several visual artifacts that aid navigation on printed
        media.
        [servilio]
        
        - Using the stylesheet registry to include the custom styles,
        instead of including them directly from the templates.
        [servilio]
        
        - Fix issue #64: Topic area listings should be restricted to the HelpCenter
        [stevem].
        
        - Make import of CMFCorePermissions compatible with later versions of CMF
        [mj]
        
        - PHC tracker cleanup [stevem]:
        Fix issue #59: Images don't show in highest level nonpaginated view
        for a PloneHelpCenter manual.
        Fix for issues #44 and 52. Make view actions Plone 2.5 friendly.
        Fix issue #55 by adding contributed spanish .po files
        Fix issue #54: German Umlaute by updating .po files
        Fix issue #54: German Umlaute by updating .po file
        Fix issue #31: Token 'ATOM' required, 'Not' found in searches.
        Fix issue #62: Duplicated listings on content-type folders
        Fix issue #35, Contents fail to display if no section value assigned
        
        - Rephrase all-content-in-one-page view's note for reference
        manuals and tutorials to make it simple/shorter and avoid the
        ambiguity-prone "page" term (simple users might think it refers
        to print media, and might be surprised :O when it doesn't
        actually fit in one page).
        [Kathryn Hryb, servilio]
        
        - Added full contents view option to TOC drop-down for section
        views of reference manual and tutorial.
        [servilio]
        
        - Fixed some templates that weren't honouring the setting of
        site_properties.allowAnonymousViewAbout
        [servilio]
        
        - Fixed document actions placement for some templates that have
        them after the title.
        [servilio]
        
        - Make getRelatedItems return an empty list when no relatedItems
        property is present.
        [servilio]
        
        - Added search template for searches by topic, audience, version.
        [stevem]
        
        - Added option to make PHC searches be global rather than local-only.
        This will support including product-area documentation in searches
        on plone.org.
        [stevem]
        
        - Added HelpCenter templates to support browsing by section (topic).
        Added some support for using the section field for a
        "topic : subtopic" taxonomy. Added portlets to support these
        pages.
        [stevem, templates by vedawms, joelburton, and limi]
        
        - Added default sections at HelpCenter folder level. These may be
        overridden in folders.
        [stevem]
        
        - Added 'Start Here' flag for key documentation
        [aclark and stevem]
        
        PloneHelpCenter 0.9
        
        - i18n improvements and general fixes in some templates
        [ferri]
        
        - Added plone-pt-br.po and plonehelpcenter-pt-br.po
        [ferri]
        
        - Another template / i18n update.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Made it possible to have standalone objects outside the Help Center
        (very useful for reference manuals, for example)
        [limi]
        
        - Major overhaul of all i18n files.
        [hannosch]
        
        - actually start using the ADD_HELP_AREA_PERMISSION as the
        add permission for HelpCenter, instead of the generic
        'Add Portal Content' permission
        [rafrombrc]
        
        - fixed lots of failing and erroring unit tests.  got all
        tests to pass w/ plones 2.0 and 2.1
        [rafrombrc]
        
        - Made Glossary's getItemsBySection() return sorted list.
        [optilude]
        
        - Made reference manual and todo navigation drop-downs select current page
        [optilude]
        
        - Removed Help Center workflow from TutorialPages for now. They should
        probably just have a simple in-progress/finished marker workflow that
        doesn't really affect permissions, but just whether they are listed
        or not in the index/page navigation. Had to remove it because of permission
        problems right now (if any pages are not published in a Tutorial, you get
        permission denied on the entire Tutorial).
        [limi]
        
        PloneHelpCenter 0.2
        
        - Added Help Center portlet, this will aggregate published entries
        from all the available Help Centers, and display links to the published
        help centers.
        [limi]
        
        - Added Glossary types, updated Help Center view
        [limi]
        
        - Added Link types
        [Joel]
        
        - Added ErrorReference types
        [Joel]
        
        - Added helpcenter_workflow & associate installation stuff.
        [Joel]
        
        - Cleaned up FAQFolder, HowtoFolder, TutorialFolder displays
        [Joel]
        
        - Folders now only list visible-to-users content
        [Joel]
        
        - Changed how versions are printed on pages: uses getVersions method
        rather than macro. Also, only prints a versions: line if there is
        anything in versions vocabulary--so, to create a help center that
        doesn't really use versions, just leave the vocab for this blank.
        It will still appear on Archetypes' forms, but won't show up
        one view modes
        [Joel]
        
        - Cleaned up and refactored text/doc files.
        [Joel]
        
        - Made many small API changes throughout. Sorry, but now this
        means that any existing Plone Help Centers will have to be migrated.
        I doubt if there are enough out there to justify making a
        migration script. The API should be fairly stable from now on,
        but keep in mind this is still only a 0.2 release ;)
        [Joel]
        
        - added an optional ReferenceField (controlled in config.py) to cross-
        reference from a PHC-type to another Archetype in the portal. This
        shouldnt affect existing code. If you have ATReferenceBrowserWidget
        installed its used instead of the dumb default ReferenceWidget.
