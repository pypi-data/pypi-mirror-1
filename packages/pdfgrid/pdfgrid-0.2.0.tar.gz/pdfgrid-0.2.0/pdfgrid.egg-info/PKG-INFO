Description: `Pdfgrid` is a Python command-line tool and module for adding a regular
        grid on top of all pages of an existing PDF document. It will mostly be
        used for measuring individual parts of PDF pages like graphics or paragraph
        widths. For the time being, only a rectangular grid with major and minor
        lines is supported, and their colour and line widths can be set individually.
        
        NOTE: This is an initial release. The API is likely to change and for the
        time being the grid size is limited to A4, but this will change in future
        releases.
        
        `Pdfgrid` depends on two Open Source libraries, namely
        `pyPdf <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyPdf>`_, a package written by
        Mathieu Fenniak and `reportlab <http://www.reportlab.org/downloads.html>`_
        by ReportLab, Ltd.
        
        This version fixes an issue with the manual installation.

        Examples
        ++++++++
        
        You can use *pdfgrid* as a Python module e.g. like in the following
        interactive Python session::
        
        >>> from reportlab.lib.colors import red
        >>> from reportlab.lib.units import cm
        >>> from pdfgrid import grid
        >>> grid("foo.pdf", origin=(0, 0), styles=[(1*cm, 0.1, red)])
        written: foo-grid.pdf
        
        In addition there is a script named ``pdfscript``, which can be used
        from the system command-line e.g. like this::
        
        $ pdfgrid -h
        $ pdfgrid -v
        $ pdfgrid --origin "0,0" --styles "1*cm,0.1,colors.red" foo.pdf
        written: foo-grid.pdf
