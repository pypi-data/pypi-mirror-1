FunkLoad is a functional and load web tester, written in Python, whose
main use cases are:

* Functional testing of web projects, and thus regression testing as well.

* Performance testing: by loading the web application and monitoring
  your servers it helps you to pinpoint bottlenecks, giving a detailed
  report of performance measurement.

* Load testing tool to expose bugs that do not surface in cursory testing,
  like volume testing or longevity testing.

* Stress testing tool to overwhelm the web application resources and test
  the application recoverability.

* Writing web agents by scripting any web repetitive task, like checking if
  a site is alive.


Main FunkLoad features are:

* FunkLoad is free software distributed under the `GNU GPL`.

* Functional test are pure Python scripts using the pyUnit framework like
  normal unit test. Python enable complex scenarios to handle real world
  applications.

* Truly emulates a web browser (single-threaded) using Richard Jones'
  webunit:

  - basic authentication support
  - cookies support
  - referrer support
  - fetching css, javascript and images
  - emulating a browser cache
  - file upload and multipart/form-data submission
  - https support

* Advanced test runner with many command-line options:

  - set the target server url
  - display the fetched page in real time in your browser
  - debug mode
  - green/red color mode
  - select test case using a regex
  - can launch normal unit test
  - can launch doctest from a plain text file or embedded in python docstring

* Turn a functional test into a load test: just by invoking the bench runner
  you can identify scalability and performance problems.

* Detailed bench reports in ReST or HTML (and PDF via ps2pdf)
  containing:

  - the bench configuration
  - tests, pages, requests stats and charts.
  - the 5 slowest requests.
  - servers cpu usage, load average, memory/swap usage and network traffic
    charts.
  - an http error summary list

* Easy test customization using a configuration file or command line options.

* Easy test creation using TCPWatch as proxy recorder, so you can use your web
  browser and produce a FunkLoad test automatically.

* Provides web assertion helpers.

* Provides a funkload.CPSTestCase to ease Zope and Nuxeo CPS testing.

* Easy to install (EasyInstall) and use, see examples in the demo folder.
