Description: FunkLoad is a functional and load web tester, written in Python, whose
        main use cases are:
        
        * Functional testing of web projects, and thus regression testing as well.
        
        * Performance testing: by loading the web application and monitoring
        your servers it helps you to pinpoint bottlenecks, giving a detailed
        report of performance measurement.
        
        * Load testing tool to expose bugs that do not surface in cursory testing,
        like volume testing or longevity testing.
        
        * Stress testing tool to overwhelm the web application resources and test
        the application recoverability.
        
        * Writing web agents by scripting any web repetitive task, like checking if
        a site is alive.
        
        
        Main FunkLoad features are:
        
        * FunkLoad is free software distributed under the `GNU GPL`.
        
        * Functional test are pure Python scripts using the pyUnit framework like
        normal unit test. Python enable complex scenarios to handle real world
        applications.
        
        * Truly emulates a web browser (single-threaded) using Richard Jones'
        webunit:
        
        - basic authentication support
        - cookies support
        - referrer support
        - http proxy support
        - fetching css, javascript and images
        - emulating a browser cache
        - file upload and multipart/form-data submission
        - https support
        
        * Advanced test runner with many command-line options:
        
        - set the target server url
        - display the fetched page in real time in your browser
        - debug mode
        - green/red color mode
        - select test case using a regex
        - support normal pyUnit test
        - support doctest from a plain text file or embedded in python docstring
        
        * Turn a functional test into a load test: just by invoking the bench runner
        you can identify scalability and performance problems.
        
        * Detailed bench reports in ReST or HTML (and PDF via ps2pdf)
        containing:
        
        - the bench configuration
        - tests, pages, requests stats and charts with percentiles.
        - the 5 slowest requests.
        - servers cpu usage, load average, memory/swap usage and network traffic
        charts.
        - an http error summary list
        
        * Easy test customization using a configuration file or command line options.
        
        * Easy test creation using TCPWatch as proxy recorder, so you can use your web
        browser and produce a FunkLoad test automatically.
        
        * Provides web assertion helpers.
        
        * Provides a funkload.CPSTestCase to ease Zope and Nuxeo CPS testing.
        
        * Easy to install (EasyInstall) and use, see examples in the demo folder.
