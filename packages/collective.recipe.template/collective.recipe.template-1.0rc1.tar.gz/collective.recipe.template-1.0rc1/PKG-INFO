Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This recipe can be used to generate textfiles from a (text) template.
        
        A short example::
        
        [buildout]
        parts = zope.conf
        
        [message]
        recipe = collective.recipe.template
        input = templates/message.in
        output = /message
        
        mymessage = Hello, World!
        
        
        In the template you can use the exact same variables as you can use
        in the buildout configuration. For example an input file can look like this::
        
        My top level directory is ${buildout:directory}
        Executables are stored in ${buildout:bin-directory}
        
        
        As an extension to the buildout syntax you can reference variables from
        the current buildout part directly. For example::
        
        My message is: ${mymessage}
        
        
        Why another template recipe?
        ----------------------------
        
        Both `iw.recipe.template`_ and `inquant.recipe.textfile`_ claim to do the
        same thing. I have found them to be undocumented and too buggy for real
        world use, and neither are in a public repository where I could fix them. In
        addition this implementation leverages the buildout variable substitution
        code, making it a lot simpler.
