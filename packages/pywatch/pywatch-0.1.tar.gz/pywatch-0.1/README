pywatch
=======
A python clone (almost) of the Linux watch command.

The pywatch.watcher.Watcher class can be told to watch a set of files,
and given a set of commands to run whenever any of those files change.

It was inspired by Ruby's ZenTest, but while it can be used for testing,
pywatch is intended to run any command when files change... test runners
or otherwise.

See pywatch.autotest for an example of a continously running
watch-and-runner.
