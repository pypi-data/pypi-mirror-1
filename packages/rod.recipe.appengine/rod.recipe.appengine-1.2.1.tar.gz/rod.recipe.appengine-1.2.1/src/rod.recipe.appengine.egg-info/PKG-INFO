        ====================
        
        Buildout recipe for setting up a google appengine development environment.
        
        The rod.recipe.appengine is a zc.buildout recipe to build, test and deploy
        projects for the google appengine. It makes it easy to use eggs and resolve
        their dependencies automatically.
        
        To be honest, this is a recipe for scrambled eggs. It produces a zip file
        containing all configured external packages in a traditional folder hierarchy.
        
        A brief documentation
        =====================
        
        This recipe takes a number of options:
        
        appengine-lib
        Path to an already installed appengine library
        
        eggs
        List of required eggs
        
        packages
        A list of packages to be included into the zip archive, which will be
        uploaded to the appspot.
        
        src
        The directory which contains the project source files.
        
        url
        The url for fetching the google appengine distribution
        
        zip-name
        The name of the zip archive containing all external packages ready
        to deploy.
        
        
        Tests
        =====
        
        We will define a buildout template used by the recipe:
        
        >>> buildout_template = """
        ... [buildout]
        ... develop = %(egg_src)s
        ... parts = sample
        ...
        ... [sample]
        ... recipe = rod.recipe.appengine
        ... eggs = foo.bar
        ... url = http://googleappengine.googlecode.com/files/google_appengine_1.2.3.zip
        ... """
        
        We'll start by creating a buildout:
        
        >>> import os.path
        >>> import rod.recipe.appengine.tests as tests
        >>> egg_src = os.path.join(os.path.split(tests.__file__)[0], 'foo.bar')
        >>> write('buildout.cfg', buildout_template % {'egg_src': egg_src})
        
        Running the buildout gives us:
        
        >>> output = system(buildout)
        >>> if output.endswith("Google App Engine distribution...\n"): True
        ... else: print output
        True
        
        And now we try to run the appserver script:
        
        >>> print system(os.path.join('bin', 'sample'))
        <BLANKLINE>
        ...
        Invalid arguments
        <BLANKLINE>
        
        There should be a configuration script in bin as well:
        
        >>> print system(os.path.join('bin', 'appcfg'))
        Usage: appcfg [options] <action>
        <BLANKLINE>
        ...
        <BLANKLINE>
