Description: The rod.recipe.appengine is a zc.buildout recipe to build, test and deploy
        projects for the google appengine. It makes it easy to use eggs and resolve
        their dependencies automatically.
        
        To be honest, this is a recipe for scrambled eggs. It produces a zip file
        containing all configured external packages in a traditional folder hierarchy.
