==================
DocFinderTab 1.0.2
==================

This product owes nearly everything to Dieter Maurer's DocFinder
product (version 1.0.3).

http://www.dieter.handshake.de/pyprojects/zope/DocFinder.html

I just put some sugar on it ;-)

Egg Installation
----------------

Just use easy_install or add Products.DocFinderTab to the eggs
section of your buildout.cfg and run buildout.

Traditional Zope Product Installation
-------------------------------------

Copy or symlink the DocFinderTab subdirectory of this package
into your Products directory.

Final Steps
-----------

Restart Zope. This will add a "Doc" tab to every object's managment
screens. Now go to an object's management screen, click the "Doc"
tab and start exploring.

See the online help for a detailed explanation of what you can
do with DocFinderTab (or read help/README.txt).
