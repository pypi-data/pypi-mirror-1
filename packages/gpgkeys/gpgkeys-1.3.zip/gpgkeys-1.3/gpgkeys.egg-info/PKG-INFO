        Command line shell for GnuPG

        Introduction
        ============
        
        **gpgkeys** is a Python program that allows to conveniently
        manage GnuPG keys and keyrings.
        
        While probably not very interesting in itself, it serves as example
        application and testbed for the development of the rl_ library.
        In particular, gpgkeys contains a sophisticated implementation of
        `filename completion`_, which may one day find its way into a standalone
        package or rl_ add-on.

        Repository Access
        -----------------
        
        gpgkeys development is hosted on github_.

        Installation
        ============
        
        gpgkeys depends on the rl_ library. Since rl_ contains a C extension, it
        is a good idea to install it independently first.
        
        Once rl is installed, type::
        
        /path/to/easy_install gpgkeys
        
        to install the ``gpgkeys`` script. Then put it on your system PATH by e.g.
        symlinking it to ``/usr/local/bin``.
        
        Example Session
        ===============
        
        Everything in gpgkeys can be tab-completed: commands, help
        topics, userids, option flags, keyids, filenames, shell
        commands, and keyserver URLs (not shown).
        ::
        
        $ gpgkeys
        gpgkeys 1.0 (type help for help)
        
        gpgkeys> help
        
        Available commands (type help <topic>):
        =======================================
        EOF       del   export  genkey     import   lsign  refresh  shell
        checksig  dump  fdump   genrevoke  list     quit   search   sign
        clear     edit  fetch   help       listsig  recv   send     version
        
        Shortcut commands (type help <topic>):
        ======================================

        Usage: export <keyspec>
        Options: --armor --output --secret
        
        Export keys to stdout or to a file

        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.3 - 2010-01-03
        ----------------
        
        - Cut down on infrastructure slack in filename completion. The
        individual strategies are very small.
        [stefan]
        
        - Remove logging as it clutters up the code.
        [stefan]
        
        - Add an example session to the README.
        [stefan]
        
        
        1.2 - 2009-11-24
        ----------------
        
        - Extend keyid completion to also complete userids and names.
        [stefan]
        
        - Extract filename completion functionality into functions,
        as it is useful in other places as well.
        [stefan]
        
        
        1.1 - 2009-11-16
        ----------------
        
        - Allow to specify the filename quoting style on the command line
        to ease experimentation.
        [stefan]
        
        - Filename completion: By dequoting early on we can skip a problematic
        hook and regain control over tilde expansion. Also see rl `issue/3`_.
        [stefan]
        
        .. _`issue/3`: http://github.com/stefanholek/rl/issues#issue/3
        
        
        1.0 - 2009-11-08
