        Command line shell for GnuPG
        ----------------------------
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        **gpgkeys** is a Python program that allows to conveniently
        manage GnuPG keys and keyrings.
        
        While probably not very interesting in itself, it serves as example
        application and testbed for the development of the rl_ library.
        In particular, gpgkeys contains a sophisticated implementation of
        `filename completion`_ which may one day find its way into a standalone
        package or rl_ add-on.

        Repository Access
        -----------------
        
        gpgkeys development is hosted on github_.

        Installation
        ============
        
        gpgkeys depends on the rl_ library. Since rl_ contains a C extension, it
        is a good idea to install it independently first.
        
        Once rl is installed, type::
        
        /path/to/easy_install gpgkeys
        
        to install the ``gpgkeys`` script. Then put it on your system PATH by e.g.
        symlinking it to ``/usr/local/bin``.
        
        Example Session
        ===============
        
        Everything in gpgkeys can be tab-completed: commands, help
        topics, userids, option flags, keyids, filenames, shell
        commands, and keyserver URLs (not shown).
        ::
        
        $ gpgkeys
        gpgkeys 1.6 (type help for help)
        
        gpgkeys> help
        
        Available commands (type help <topic>):
        =======================================
        EOF       del   export  genkey     import   lsign  refresh  shell
        checksig  dump  fdump   genrevoke  list     quit   search   sign
        clear     edit  fetch   help       listsig  recv   send     version
        
        Shortcut commands (type help <topic>):
        ======================================
        e  ll  ls
        
        gpgkeys> help export
        Usage: export <keyspec>
        Options: --armor --clean --minimal --output --secret
        
        Export keys to stdout or to a file
        
        gpgkeys> ls Stefan
        pub   1024R/E1F438AD 1995-10-03
        uid                  Stefan H. Holek (RSA) <stefan@epy.co.at>
        
        pub   1024D/355A2D28 2001-11-04
        uid                  Stefan H. Holek <stefan@epy.co.at>
        sub   2048g/A27E0DBC 2004-10-27
        
        gpgkeys> export --armor E1F438AD > stefan.asc
        gpgkeys> .ls
        alice.asc             stefan.asc
        
        gpgkeys understands shell pipes and input/output redirects. This
        allows things like::
        
        gpgkeys> export E1F438AD | pgpdump | less
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.6 - 2010-01-31
        ----------------
        
        - Add --clean and --minimal import/export options to respective commands.
        [stefan]
        
        - Fix --merge-only import option of keyserver commands.
        [stefan]
        
        - Remove the --yes option again since it has no apparent effect.
        [stefan]
        
        
        1.5 - 2010-01-26
        ----------------
        
        - Remove obsolete --secret option from the import command.
        [stefan]
        
        - Userid completion is now triggered by any kind of quoting.
        [stefan]
        
        - Allow to specifiy command line options after the argument.
        [stefan]
        
        
        1.4 - 2010-01-20
        ----------------
        
        - Extend the quoting and dequoting API to make it more (re)usable.
        [stefan]
        
        - Dequoting didn't work right when the default quoting character
        was single quote.
        [stefan]
        
        - Tildes in quoted filenames could cause quotes to be closed even
        if the tilde-expanded name matched a directory.
        [stefan]
        
        
        1.3 - 2010-01-03
        ----------------
        
        - Cut down on infrastructure slack in filename completion. The
        individual strategies are very small.
        [stefan]
        
        - Remove logging as it clutters up the code.
        [stefan]
        
        - Add an example session to the README.
        [stefan]
        
        
        1.2 - 2009-11-24
        ----------------
        
        - Extend keyid completion to also complete userids and names.
        [stefan]
        
        - Extract filename completion functionality into functions,
        as it is useful in other places as well.
        [stefan]
        
        
        1.1 - 2009-11-16
        ----------------
        
        - Allow to specify the filename quoting style on the command line
        to ease experimentation.
        [stefan]
        
        - Filename completion: By dequoting early on we can skip a problematic
        hook and regain control over tilde expansion. Also see rl `issue/3`_.
        [stefan]
        
        .. _`issue/3`: http://github.com/stefanholek/rl/issues#issue/3
        
        
        1.0 - 2009-11-08
        ----------------
        
        - Initial release.
