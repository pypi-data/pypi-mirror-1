        Introduction
        ============
        
        The **gpgkeys** program is a Python application that allows to conveniently
        manage GnuPG keys and keyrings.
        
        While probably not very interesting in itself, it serves as example
        application and testbed for the development of the rl_ library.
        
        In particular, gpgkeys contains a sophisticated implementation of
        `filename completion`_, which may one day find its way into a standalone
        package or rl_ add-on.

        Installation
        ============
        
        gpgkeys depends on the rl_ library. Since rl_ contains a C extension, it
        is a good idea to install it independently first.
        
        Once rl is installed, type::
        
        /path/to/easy_install gpgkeys
        
        to install the gpgkeys script. Then put it on your system PATH by e.g.
        symlinking it to ``/usr/local/bin``.
