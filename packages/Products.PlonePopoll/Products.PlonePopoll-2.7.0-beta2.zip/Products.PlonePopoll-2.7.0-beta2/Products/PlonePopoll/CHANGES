Considered future features
##########################

New types of polls may be interesting (Idea from
http://www.apwiz.com/flexivote.htm):

* open poll lets you see results before voting
* in a blind vote you must vote first, but can see all details
* In private poll you see results but not how people voted
* In a secret vote only the owner can see results and voting pattern.

To do
#####

* Test SQL back-end (find volunteers, we don't want to support this in
  the future).

* Cleanup and spread in appropriate external methods what's in
  Extensions/Install.py. We install with GenericSetup from now.

* Provide zconfig features to select and configure the votes back-end
  (see note about SQL back-end above)

* Use a Zope 3 view for the poll to speed up

* Should we keep migrations ? (useless for old AT based Popoll).

* Notify translators about new msgids.

* Why are the entries of the combo in portlet configuration untranslated when the code (browser/popoll.py)
