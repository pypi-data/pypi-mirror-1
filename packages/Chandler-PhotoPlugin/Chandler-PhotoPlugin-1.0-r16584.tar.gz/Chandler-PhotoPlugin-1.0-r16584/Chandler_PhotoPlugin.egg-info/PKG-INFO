Description: The Photo Plug-in is an experimental plug-in, created early on to
        demonstrate some of the things that are possible in Chandler Desktop's
        plug-in framework. However, as we've made changes and improvements to the app,
        plug-ins such as this one have not been updated or tested. As a result, to
        safeguard against data corruption, we recommend that you run a separate, clean
        version of Chandler when installing plug-ins.
        
        
        This plugin provides support for photo loading in Chandler.
        
        To download and install the plugin from the Chandler UI,
        use the "Plugins -> Download" and "Plugins -> Install" menus.
        
        To download and install the plugin from the command line, use Chandler's
        InstallPlugin script and restart Chandler::
        
        InstallPlugin Chandler-PhotoPlugin
        
        If you want to work on its code, you can use::
        
        RunPython setup.py develop
        
        to install it in development mode (where you can make changes and have them
        take effect whenever Chandler is restarted), or you can use::
        
        RunPython setup.py install
        
        to install it as an ``.egg`` file.
        
        Note that when installed as an egg file, changes made to the source code will
        not affect Chandler execution, until you run ``setup.py install`` or ``setup.py
        develop`` again.
        
        After making changes to this plugin, you should update its version number in
        ``setup.py`` and in the chandler/Makefile, so that people using "quick builds"
        of Chandler will use your new version.
        
        If you want to run this plugin's tests use::
        
        RunPython setup.py test
