Description: The rod.recipe.py2app helps to create standalone Mac OS X application bundles
        using py2app and PyObjC. It aims to provide handling eggs within a zc.buildout
        environment.
        
        To be honest, this is a recipe for scrambled eggs. The current py2app version
        lacks of supporting python eggs, especially namespace packages. This recipe
        reconstructs a directory tree from the contents of the given eggs.
