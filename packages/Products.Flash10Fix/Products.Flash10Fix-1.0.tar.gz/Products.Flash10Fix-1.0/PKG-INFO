Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Adobe Flash 10 introduced an additional security check such that it will only
        play files served with the "Content-Disposition: inline" header.  Current
        versions of Plone do not set this header correctly for .swf files stored
        as ATFiles.  (See http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8624 for more information.)
        
        This package corrects that by augmenting ATFile's list of mimetypes that
        should be served with the inline content disposition.
        
        This patch will no longer be necessary in the first version of Plone that
        incorporates ATContentTypes 1.2.7
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        If using buildout, simply add Products.Flash10Fix to your buildout's list of
        eggs, rerun buildout, and restart Zope.
        
        If not using buildout, unpack the product tarball in your Products directory
        and restart Zope.
        
        No additional steps are required.  If the patch was successful, you should
        see "Flash10Fix Patched the following classes: ATFile" on the console when
        running Zope in the foreground.
