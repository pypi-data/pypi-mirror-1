        Django Math Captcha is an easy way to add mathematical captcha verification to your already existing forms.
        It asks you a simple math question (eg ``'1 + 2 ='``) and validates the form if your response is correct.
        All you have to do is subclass either ``MathCaptchaForm`` or ``MathCaptchaModelForm`` in your own forms.
        
        Use it in your forms::
        
        from math_captcha import MathCaptchaModelForm
        from myapp.models import Blog
        
        class MyExistingForm(MathCaptchaModelForm): # instead of forms.ModelForm
        #... extra fields here
        
        class Meta:
        model = Blog
        
        
        Now you can be certain that the only users who create blogs are humans
