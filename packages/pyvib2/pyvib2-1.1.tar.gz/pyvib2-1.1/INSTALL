INTRODUCTION

    PyVib2 requires at a minumum Python 2.3 and depends on several external
    packages, which are to be installed prior to the program itself.

DEPENDENCIES

    These packages are available in the binary form for the most operating
    systems. Debian users can use apt-get to install them from the repositories.

    1) Python Megawidgets - a library for a flexible GUI building,
    based on Tkinter.

    See http://sourceforge.net/projects/pmw.
    To test if the installation was successful, execute in a Python shell :
        
    >>> import Pmw
    
    2) NumPy 1.0+ - the fundamental package for scientific computing.

    See http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy.
    To test if the installation was successful, execute in a Python shell :
        
    >>> import numpy
    
    3) VTK 4.4+ - Visualization ToolKit, a high-level 3D rendering library.

    See http://vtk.org.
    Do not forget to install the Python bindings to VTK. To test if the
    installation was successful, execute in a Python shell :
        
    >>> import vtk
    
    4) Matplotlib 0.86+ - a 2D plotting library for producing publication
    quality figures.

    See http://sourceforge.net/projects/matplotlib.
    To test if the installation was successful, execute in a Python shell :
        
    >>> import matplotlib
    
OPTIONAL UTILITIES

    PyVib2 enables the user to produce animations of vibrations in the
    Animated GIF and FLI format. For that the following external utilities are
    needed : 
        1) Animated GIF
            Netpbm - graphics tools and converters.
                See http://sourceforge.net/projects/netpbm.
                
            Gifsicle - a UNIX command-line tool for creating, editing,
            and getting information about GIF images and animations.
                See http://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/.
            
        2) FLI
            ppm2fli - producing FLI animation files.
                See http://vento.pi.tu-berlin.de/ppm2fli/main.html.
            
    To produce spectra in the PDF format the ps2pdf program must be installed.
    See http://www.ps2pdf.com.

PYVIB2

    To install the program itself (administrator privileges are required) :

    1) Unpack the installation archive :
      
       # tar xvfz pyvib2-1.0.tar.gz

    2) Change to the installation directory :
      
       # cd pyvib2-1.0

    3) Execute the setup script :

       # python setup.py install

    Upon a successful installation, start the pyvib2 script :
      
       $ pyvib2
