This package contains a sequence widget for Zope 3's form framework
(zope.app.form and also zope.formlib).  It's both simpler and more
user-friendly than the standard sequence widget. The widget originally
appeared in the World Cookery application, the demo application for
Philipp von Weitershausen's book "Web Component Development with Zope 3"
(http://worldcookery.com).
