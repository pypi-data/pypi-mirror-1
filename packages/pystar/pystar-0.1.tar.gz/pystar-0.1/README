PyStar -- A* graph search implementation
****************************************

This package implements the A* graph search algorithm.  I tried to find a
decent one for Python on the Interweb, but the only one I found (at
http://arainyday.se/projects/python/AStar) was just too cryptic for me to
understand and use.  So I knocked this up from pseudocode on the Wikipedia
A* page.

Installation
============

To build it:

    python setup.py build

To install it:

    python setup.py install

Type

    python setup.py --help

for other things you can do.

Note: if you're on a Linux box you can just type 'make' and 'make install'
in the usual manner.

Examples
========

There's one example, in the 'demo' directory.  It reimplements the example
given on the original AStar page, but in Tkinter instead of pygame.

Problems, bugs, etc
