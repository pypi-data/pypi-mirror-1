=============

django-ticker is a reusable Django_ application that provides a ticker like
news section including row level permissions. What does this mean?

In django-ticker you have a fine grained permission control what the
(administrative) user can do and what not. Besides the default Django
permissions -- add, change, delete -- there are some extra permissions:

- change_foreign
- publish

Originally this was created for the news section of the `German Django community`_ 
where foreign users could add articles but had no permission to publish
them, cause a moderator must check these articles first. 

It's easy to create a pressroom like workflow, assumed we have different
people with different permissions:

The freelance journalist:
    Granted permissions: add, change
    
    - can add articles
    - can change his articles (only his own)
    - can not delete his articles
    - can set the status of the article to "closed" or "draft". Draft means,
      that the article is ready for check by a moderator.
    - in the admin list of articles, they see only they own

The journalist:
    Granted permissions: add, change, delete, publish
    
    - can add articles
    - can change and delete his articles (only his own)
    - can set the status of the article to "closed", "draft" or "published"
    - in the admin list of articles, they see only their own

The chief editor (or moderator):
    Granted permissions: add, change, delete, publish, change_foreign
    
    - can add articles
    - can change and delete all (!) articles
    - can set the status of the article to "closed", "draft" or "published"
    - in the admin list of articles, they see all articles
    
The proofreader (or subject specialist):
    Granted permissions: change, change_foreign
    
    - can not add articles
    - can not delete articles
    - can not publish articles
    - can change all articles (e.g. for correction)
    - in the admin list of articles, they see all articles
    
So, you can mix these permissions and create a workflow that perfectly 
fits your needs.
