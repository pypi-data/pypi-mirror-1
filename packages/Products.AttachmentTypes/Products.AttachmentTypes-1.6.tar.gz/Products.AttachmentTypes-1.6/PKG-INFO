Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Several Plone products have a need to handle simple attachments: content
        types that do not have a workflow and no view of their own but will reuse the
        permissions on their container. AttachmentTypes implements simple link, image
        and file attachment types that can serve this need.
        
        Installation
        
        Install in the usual way, using the QuickInstaller.
        
        Acknowlegements
        
        These types were taken from the RichDocument product.
