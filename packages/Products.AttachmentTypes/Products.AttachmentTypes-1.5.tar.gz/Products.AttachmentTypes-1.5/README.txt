Introduction
============

Several Plone products have a need to handle simple attachments: content
types that do not have a workflow and no view of their own but will reuse the
permissions on their container. AttachmentTypes implements simple link, image
and file attachment types that can serve this need.

Installation

    Install in the usual way, using the QuickInstaller.

Acknowlegements

    These types were taken from the RichDocument product.
