        Example usage
        =============
        
        The value of this recipe is that its part can be referenced from other parts
        using the ${...} syntax. The recipe mirrors the current environment variables
        into its section, so that e.g. ${env:USER} will give the current user.
        
        In addition to whatever is in the environment, `UID` and `GID` will be set to
        the effective user id and group id as reported by Python's `os` module.
        
        Let's look at how this works:
        
        >>> write('buildout.cfg',
        ... """
        ... [buildout]
        ... parts = env
        ...
        ... [env]
        ... recipe = gocept.recipe.env
        ... """)
        
        This configuration references an environment variable called
        `buildout-test-info`. Lets set it so we know its value:
        
        >>> import os
        >>> os.environ['buildout-test-info'] = '42'
        
        Running the buildout gives us::
        
        >>> print 'start', system(buildout) # doctest:+ELLIPSIS
        start...
        Installing env.
        <BLANKLINE>
        
        And the `installed.cfg` recorded the corresponding environment value:
        
        >>> cat('.installed.cfg')
        [buildout]
        ...
        [env]
        ...
        GID = ...
        ...
        UID = ...
        ...
        buildout-test-info = 42
        ...
