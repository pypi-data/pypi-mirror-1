WSGI proxy for transforming hAtom to Atom via hAtom2Atom.xsl.

Thanks to Robert Bachmann for suggesting improvements.

== License ==

This license does not apply to hAtom2Atom.xsl itself, which
has its own license (w3). I (Luke Arno) wrote the original version
of hAtom2Atom.xsl (very simple and lame) but Robert Bachmann 
<http://rbach.priv.at/> and Benjamin Carlyle <http://soundadvice.id.au/> 
have really run with it (and they created all the test html/atom files
and uri.xsl).

The current hAtom2Atom.xsl is at http://rbach.priv.at/hAtom2Atom/

As for the rest of this package:
