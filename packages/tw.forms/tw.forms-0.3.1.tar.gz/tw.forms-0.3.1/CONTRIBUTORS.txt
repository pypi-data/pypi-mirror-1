twForms Contributors
=========================

* Michele Cella did the original implementation of many form fields in TG
  widgets which were copied almost verbatim into twForms.
* Max Ischenko wrote the original DataGrids.
* Pauli Virtanen implemented the SecureFormMixin and contrubuted some good
  patches.
* Roger Demetrescu has provided Mako templates for all Form fields (and has 
  uncoverded on the process some bugs in ToscaWidgets which made life
  unnecesarily difficult for Mako users)
* Timothy Sweetser has contributed fieldfactory.py

I must not forget all of those who've contributed to TurboGears' widgets which
TG owes it's whole existence (you know who you are ;)

Many thanks to all! :)
