Using twForms with Pylons. Part 1
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Introduction
------------

twForms is a form generation library built using ToscaWidgets. Since it is the
most used Tosca "widget", twForms is commonly believed to *be* ToscaWidgets
(even I often use the terms interchangeably).

ToscaWidgets is a framework to package and
distribute chunks of html templates, javascript, css and the python code that
makes them tick. When properly configured, widgets built with ToscaWidgets can
be used in any python framework or application that can use WSGI middleware.

This tutorial will focus on its usage on Pylons, however, the core concepts
apply equally to any python web framework. The only difference is how TW's
middleware is integrated and the detailed steps provided (file paths, etc...)

Scope
-----

This tutorial will cover:

 * How to configure ToscaWidgets in Pylons.
 * How to build a simple web form using simple fields.
 * How to add validators to the form's fields.
 * How to use fancy fields which require javascript.

Requirements
------------

This tutorial has been tested with Pylons 0.9.6.1 and Toscawidgets
0.1a2dev_r3534. Any version later than those should work fine too.

Since Mako is the official template language used by Pylons, this tutorial
will use Mako templates too. Any python templating engine that implements a
``python.templating.engine`` entry-point should be usable too. Both to create
custom widgets and to display them on. ToscaWidgets has been tested on Mako,
Genshi, Kid and Cheetah.

To make installation easier and better separate the controller layer from the
view layer, this tutorial will use lxml to inject resources (css and javascript
links) into the html page.

Installation
------------

Use ``easy_install`` to install twForms, this should pull ToscaWidgets and all
required dependencies too::
    
    easy_install twForms


Pylons >= 0.9.6.1 is assumed to be already instaled.

Configuring ToscaWidgets
------------------------

Bootstrap an empty Pylons project to follow the rest of the tutorial::

    paster create --template=pylons TWTutorial

Now you should edit ``twtutorial.config.middleware`` to stack TW's middleware.

First of all, at the beginning of the module, import TW's middleware and
Pylons' HostFramework object:

.. code-block:: python

   from toscawidgets.middleware import TGWidgetsMiddleware
   from toscawidgets.mods.pylonshf import PylonsHostFramework

Now, after the line that says "CUSTOM MIDDLEWARE HERE" inside ``make_app()``, 
add:

.. code-block:: python

    host_framework = PylonsHostFramework(default_view="mako")
    app = TGWidgetsMiddleware(app, host_framework)

You should now be able to launch your app with
``paster serve --reload development.ini``, point your browser to
http://localhost:5000/ and see Pylons's default welcome page.

Building your first twForms form
--------------------------------

Create a file called ``widgets.py`` inside the ``twtutorial`` package and type
or paste the following code:

.. code-block:: python

    from toscawidgets.widgets import forms
    from toscawidgets.api import WidgetsList

    forms.FormField.engine_name = "mako"

    class PostForm(forms.ListForm):
        class fields(WidgetsList):
            title = forms.TextField()
            author = forms.SingleSelectField(
                options = ["Peter", "Lucy"]
                )
            content = forms.TextArea()

    post_form = PostForm("post_form")

The above code should be, more or less, self-explanatory:

We create a ListForm subclass (a form which renders its fields in an unordered
list) which has three fields:

 * a ``TextField``, which is a, surprise, single-line text entry field
 * a ``SingleSelectField``, which is a drop-down kind of field
 * a ``TextArea``, which is a multi-line text entry field

Then we initialize the form class as a module level instance and give it a
*post_form* id. This id will be useful later when we apply CSS selectors or
attach javascript event handlers.

Notice that the form is instantiated at import time. This is how widgets are
usually instantiated and used (but not neccesarily so). There is no
thread-safety issues with the above code because widgets are **state-less**,
that is, once it's initial state is fixed when initialized, it's attributes are
**never** modified again. This does not mean we cannot modify how they're
rendered on every request. We can do it by overriding their *params* when
rendering them, more on this later.

One special detail worth mentioning: Notice the line where we modify the
``engine_name`` of the ``FormField`` class attribute? Well, this is because
twForms was initially built using Genshi templates so ``genshi`` remains the
default template engine used. Roger Demetrescu has kindly ported all twForms'
templates to Mako so, in order to avoid the Genshi dependency and obtain a
significant speed boost, you can change this class attribute to ``mako`` and
all widgets inside the twForms package will use their Mako templates.

Displaying the form
-------------------

To see the markup that the form produces when rendered we can do it directly
from the command-line, just import the ``widgets`` module we just created and
call the ``post_form`` instance:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from twtutorial.widgets import post_form
    >>> print post_form()

Produces:

.. code-block:: html

    <form id="post_form" action="" method="post" class="postform">
        <div>
        </div>
        <ul class="field_list" >
            <li class="even">            
                <label id="post_form_title.label" for="post_form_title" class="fieldlabel required">Title</label>
                <input type="text" name="title" class="textfield required" id="post_form_title" value="" />
            </li>
            <li class="odd">            
                <label id="post_form_author.label" for="post_form_author" class="fieldlabel">Author</label>
                <select name="author" class="singleselectfield" id="post_form_author">
            <option value="Peter">Peter</option>
            <option value="Lucy">Lucy</option>
    </select>
            </li>
            <li class="even">            
                <label id="post_form_content.label" for="post_form_content" class="fieldlabel">Content</label>
                <textarea id="post_form_content" name="content" class="textarea" rows="25" cols="79"></textarea>
            </li>
            <li class="odd">            
                <input type="submit" class="submitbutton" id="post_form_submit" value="Submit" />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </form>

I hope the above hints at one of the benefits twForms provides over writting
forms using plain old HTML: Valid, accesible, easily maintainable markup with
just a little over 5 lines of code.

As you can see, the ``ListForm`` generates an unordered list of fields and
their labels. For the vast majority of forms it will suffice to add a stylesheet
to customize the visual appeatance of the form. If more control over the
generated layout is needed, the template can be overriden so each field can
be precisely positioned. This will be covered in an upcoming tutorial.

Using the form in your application
----------------------------------

Lets create a new controller and a mako template to use the this form in our
application. First the controller::

    paster controller tutorial

Now edit ``twtutorial.controllers.tutorial`` so it looks like:

.. code-block:: python

    import logging

    from twtutorial.lib.base import *

    log = logging.getLogger(__name__)

    class TutorialController(BaseController):

        def index(self):
            return render('/tutorial.mako')

And add a file called ``tutorial.mako`` inside the ``templates`` folder with
the following code:

.. code-block:: html+mako

    <%!
        from twtutorial.widgets import post_form
    %>

    <html>
        <head>
            <title>ToscaWidgets Tutorial</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>Welcome to the ToscaWidgets tutorial!</h1>
            ${post_form()}
        </body>
    </html>


You should now be able to point your browser to http://localhost:5000/tutorial
and see the form we just created.

Using the form to validate input
--------------------------------

What we have just covered doesn't provide much more value than what using mako
functions or webhelpers to generate the fields markup would have provided.

However, twForms integrates nicely with FormEncode (does **not** replace it!) to
have the objects which will validate our input near the fields they're
validating.

Edit the ``PostForm`` widget
============================

Lets edit the form we created before and make it look like this:

.. code-block:: python

    from toscawidgets.widgets.forms.validators import UnicodeString, Email
    # All other imports...

    class PostForm(forms.ListForm):
        class fields(WidgetsList):
            title = forms.TextField(
                validator = UnicodeString(not_empty=True)
                )
            email = forms.TextField(
                validator = Email(not_empty=True)
                )
            author = forms.SingleSelectField(
                options = ["Peter", "Lucy"]
                )
            content = forms.TextArea()

Notice that:

* We're importing the validators from the twForms' ``validators`` module. This 
  module includes all validators from FormEncode but overrides ``UnicodeString``
  so it doesn't encode strings when converting from python.
  This is needed because Genshi and Mako need all strings to be unicode
  internally (or at least be ascii encodable). twForms fully supports unicode
  which should be no surprise since I speak Espa√±ol and write with funny
  decorated characters :).

* We added an email field (which makes little sense in a blog post form) for the
  sake of showing off the ``Email`` validator.

Edit the template
=================

To pass an ``action`` parameter when displaying the form. Edit the template
so that the line where the form is displayed looks like::

    ${post_form(action=h.url_for(controller='tutorial', action='save'))}
    
This is the "params-overriding" I talked about a few lines ago...

Edit the controller
===================

To implement the ``save`` method. Edit the controller to add a method that looks
like:

.. code-block:: python

    @validate(form=post_form, error_handler="index")
    def save(self):
        response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'text/plain'
        if hasattr(self, 'form_result'):
            return pformat(self.form_result)
        else:
            return "You must POST to this method, dummy!"

Note that:

* The ``validate()`` decorator being used is **not** the one provided
  by Pylons's but one provided by ``toscawidgets.mods.pylonshf``
  (``from toscawidgets.mods.pylonshf import validate``).

* ``post_form`` is the form instance in the ``widgets`` module
  (``from twtutorial.widgets import post_form``).

* The ``error_handler`` parameter is the name of the method that should be
  called when validation fails. When a form is validated and validation fails
  the resulting ``formencode.api.Invalid`` exception is stored for the duration
  of the current request, along with the invalid input, so the form can be
  redisplayed with user-friendly error messages and previous input.

* ``pformat`` belongs in the ``pprint`` module of the standard library
  (``from pprint import pformat``).


Try it out!
===========

You should now be able to point your browser to http://localhost:5000/tutorial
and see the form with the new ``email`` field. Fill the form with invalid input
and submit it. You should see the error messages beside the fields with your
previous input pre-filled so you don't have to type it again (your users will
love you!).

When you finally fill it right you should see the dict the ``validate()``
decorator leaves at ``self.form_result``. Try to put some accented characters at
the ``title`` field, you should see that the field value is decoded into a
useful unicode value that your application can handle internally.

Using fancy fields
------------------

I'll finally cover in this tutorial how we can enhance our form with some fancy
fields which use Javascript to enhance the user's experience.

A little theory
===============

ToscaWidgets tracks the javascript (and CSS) dependencies of every widget so
whenever they're displayed on a page the appropiate links are included. The
middleware intercepts those requests that ask for one of these static files and
automatically serves them.

It has two mechanisms to "inject" these resources:

* The "official" one which is copied from the way TurboGears' widgets injects
  them. This method involves a "master" or "base" template which is inherited
  by every template you want to display widgets on, a special container in
  which you pass widgets to the template from the controller and a wrapper
  around the (deprecated I believe) ``render_response`` Pylons' function.

* The (now not so much) "experimental" one which is based on an idea that
  Ian Bicking expressed in his `blog <http://blog.ianbicking.org/lxml-transformations.html>`_.
  This method is the recommended approach for two important reasons:

  #. It's **much** easier to set up.
  #. It lets you import the widgets directly from your template, freeing
     your controller from view code hence offering a better separation
     between the MVC layers.

  It has one downside though: Only HTML (not XHTML) output is currently
  supported. This is due to a limitation in libxslt (used internally by lxml)
  which doesn't support XSLT2 (the only version which can serialize XHTML.
  Please, please, please correct me if I'm wrong!). Since I personally always
  render HTML in my apps due to current browsers' limitations I condider this
  to be a non-issue :)

In this tutorial I will only cover the second mechanism. For instructions on how
to use the first one consult this `sample app <http://svn.turbogears.org/projects/ToscaWidgets/trunk/examples/PylonsTWSample/>`_.

Install lxml
============

Easy-cheesy thanks to setuptools::
    
    easy_install lxml

You'll need a compiler and libxml and libxslt in Mac OSX or Linux, I believe
there are pre-compiled eggs for Windows. Consult lxml's
`web page <http://codespeak.net/lxml/>`_ for details.

Enable resource injection in the middleware
===========================================

Just set a flag when initializing it. Change the line where it's stacked in
middleware.py so it looks like:

.. code-block:: python

    app = TGWidgetsMiddleware(app, host_framework, inject_resources=True)

Add your fancy fields to the form
=================================

Ok, a plain textarea is not the coolest way to edit a blog post... lets use a
rich text editor! First install the egg::

    easy_install twTinyMCE

Now import it in your widgets module:

.. code-block:: python

    from toscawidgets.widgets.tinymce import TinyMCE

Finally edit the ``content`` field so it looks like this:

.. code-block:: python

    class PostForm(forms.ListForm):
        class fields(WidgetsList):
            # Other fields...
            content = TinyMCE()

You should now be able to point your browser to http://localhost:5000/tutorial/
an see a full-featured rich text editor!
