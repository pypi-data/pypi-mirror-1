"""babtools_EXAMPLE - Example structure for babtools.

Plans: 
   - None. At the moment I'm happy with this structure.


Ideas: 
   - Adding information, how to use Mercurial to use this structure 
     in your own project and keep it up to date while keeping your changes. 
   - Get the version information from the Changelog. -> i.e.: First line.split()[-1] 
     => One less point where I have to change things when updating.
