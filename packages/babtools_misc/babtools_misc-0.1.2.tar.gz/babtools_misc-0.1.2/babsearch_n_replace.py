"""Search and replace text strings inside text files. 

usage: 
	- babsearch_n_replace.py [options] "Search String" "Replace String" file1 dir1 file2 file3 
	  replace the text string in every text file
...

options: 
	--verbose 
	  print the files in which we found the search string. 
	--dry-run 
	  don't change any files. 
	--suffixes a list of suffixes seperated by commas. 
	  Examples: 
              "--suffixes=.txt,.html" - only .txt and .html 
              "--sufixes=" - match all files.
          Default: .txt,.mdwn,.yml,.xml,.htm,.html,.py

Decisions: 
	- No undoing, because undoing could do more harm than just replacing back 
          (would remove all new file changes -> damn unexpected!). 

Ideas: 
	- Treat linebreaks as whitespace.
