                     Pitch Class Sets for Python

                         version 2.0.0 beta 1

                               TESTING

You can test this package to see if it works on your system before
you install it. I used pure Python throughout, so it shouldn't be a
problem, but I was using Python 2.5.1, and I run Linux. Hopefully this
will work on Windows. But hey, you can find out if pcsets works on
your platform by running the test suite. Try this:

    python runtest.py

The 'catalog' module will take a while to do its thing (on my system,
4.3 seconds) because it has to sort through 4096 possible unordered
pitch class sets and narrow them down to 224 prime forms.

It should run all 4 test suites. If you encounter a problem on a
particular module, it would be helpful if you'd rerun the specific
test and send the output to me, along with details about your Python
version, platform, etc.

Here's how to rerun a specific module test: if you had a failure in,
say, the module 'pcset', you'd just run:

    python runtest.py pcset

It will go into specific detail about what worked and what failed.

Want to see some demos? Try this:

    python pcsets/catalog.py

    python pcsets/noteops.py


                             INSTALLATION

If you run:

    python setup.py install

This should place the pcsets package in your Python distribution's
site-packages.  Provided your distro is properly configured, that is.
