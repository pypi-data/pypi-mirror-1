MOAI Metadata Module
====================

The metadata module contains some OAI metadataprefix implementations.

Normally you would not need to import these classes directly, unless 
you want to subclass them. 

When you create your own metadataprefixes, you don't have to put them in this
module, just use the 'name' method on the class, and the metadataprefix will
automaticly be registeren under that name


.. automodule:: moai.metadata

   .. autoclass:: moai.metadata.OAIDC
      :members:
      :undoc-members:
   
   .. autoclass:: moai.metadata.MODS
      :members:
      :undoc-members:


Some additional metadata prefix extensions are located
in the `extensions directory`:

.. automodule:: moai.extensions
   
   .. autoclass:: moai.extensions.dare_didl.DIDL
      :members:
      :undoc-members:
