MOAI Codebase
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MOAI Codebase consists of a number of modules, :ref:`interfaces`, and an extension mechanism.

The :ref:`interfaces` can have several implementations, and
can be plugged into the MOAI server, by using specific configuration profiles.

Besides the code, there are also some unittests. You can run them by calling the `test` script in the `bin` directory. Most of the tests are in the form of unittests, but there's also a nice doctest in the `README.txt` file. This gives a nice birdseye overview of the whole MOAI system.
