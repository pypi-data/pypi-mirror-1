Standards for Web Content Interoperability

From the Open Archives website [#f1]_:

        The Open Archives Initiative develops and promotes interoperability standards that aim to facilitate the efficient dissemination of content. 
        OAI has its roots in the open access and institutional repository movements. 
        Continued support of this work remains a cornerstone of the Open Archives program. Over time, however, the work of OAI has expanded to promote broad access to digital resources for eScholarship, eLearning, and eScience. 


The MOAI Server produces output using the OAI-PMH (Open Archives Initiative, Protocol for Metadata Harvesting) 2.0 specification [#f2]_.
