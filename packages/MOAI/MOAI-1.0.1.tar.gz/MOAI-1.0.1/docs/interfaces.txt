.. _icontentprovider:

IContentProvider
================

MOAI is a server platform, but to be a server you need stuff to be served.
This is where the ContentProviders come into play. They provide content, that
can come from different sources.

A content provider can be asked to update it's list of ids. 
Afterwards, the actual content can be retrieved by id.

.. _icontentobject:

IContentObject
==============

Content itself should implement the IContentObject interface.
This makes sure that every content object has some specific
attributes that are needed to be able to serve them in an oai
feed.

Besides these required attributes, the CotentObject also has a
field_names and get_values method that can be used to return additional
field names and their values.

If you need to serve content coming from your custom XML files, or database schemas, then you will probably need to create an implementation of this object.
