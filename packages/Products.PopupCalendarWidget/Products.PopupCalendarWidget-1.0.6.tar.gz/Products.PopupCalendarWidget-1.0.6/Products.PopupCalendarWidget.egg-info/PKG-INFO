        About
        
        The PopupCalendarWidget is meant to replace the default calendar widget
        with a javascript popup calendar based on The DHTML Calendar that is
        included with Plone.
        
        Usage
        
        You can set up the popup calendar using these options in your widget:
        
        ifFormat
        
        date format that will be stored in the input field.  The default value
        is localLongTimeFormat from site_properties.
        
        default: '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'
        
        showsTime
        
        if true the calendar will include a time selector
        
        default: 'true'
        
        timeFormat
        
        the time format can be "12" or "24"
        
        default: '24'
        
        weekNumbers
        
        if it's true the calendar will display week numbers
        
        default: 'false'
        
        firstDay
        
        numeric: 0 to 6.  "0" means display Sunday first, "1" means display
        Monday first, etc.
        
        default: '0'
        
        range
        
        range of years in an array, ex. [1999,2010].  The default value is
        derived from site_properties calendar_starting_year and
        calendar_starting_year + calendar_future_years_available.
        
        default (in the year 2007): [1999, 2012]
        
        singleClick
        
        whether the calendar is in single click mode or not
        
        default: 'true'
        
        electric
        
        if true (default) then given fields/date areas are updated for each move
        otherwise they're updated only on close
        
        default: 'true'
        
        step
        
        configures the step of the years in drop-down boxes
        
        default: '1'
        
        showOthers
        
        if "true" it will show days from other months too
        
        default: 'false'
        
        calendar_icon
        
        select an icon for the edit page popup button
        
        default: 'popup-calendar.gif'
        
        helper_css
        
        the css used to render the calendar.  some of the other stock css are

        1.0.6 - 2009-04-30
        
        - Minor bug fixes to checkForDate.py.  Now if the date cannot be converted, returns original value. If cannot be formatted, returns date formatted as "mm/dd/yyyy"
        
        1.0.3 - 2007-08-17
        
        - Changed the helper_css for the widget to be a tuple as this is what is
        expected.  This was causing some strange style issues in Safari and IE
        since the string was getting split up and creating erroneous style sheets
        
        1.0.2 - 2007-06-21
        
        - Made the date range and ifFormat configurable via the widget.  See the
        README for details.
        
        - Not installing the demo type by default anymore.  Set the DEMO_TYPE
        variable in the config.py to True to use it.
        
        1.0.1 - 2006-04-09
        
        - Minor bug fix to the popup_calendar.pt edit macro.  There was a missing $
        for the call to the portal_url variable.  Thanks to Jim Baack for the fix.
        
        1.0 - 2006-03-23
        
        - initial import into the Plone Software Center
