1.0.3 - 2007-08-17

    - Changed the helper_css for the widget to be a tuple as this is what is
      expected.  This was causing some strange style issues in Safari and IE
      since the string was getting split up and creating erroneous style sheets

1.0.2 - 2007-06-21

    - Made the date range and ifFormat configurable via the widget.  See the
      README for details.
    
    - Not installing the demo type by default anymore.  Set the DEMO_TYPE
      variable in the config.py to True to use it.

1.0.1 - 2006-04-09

    - Minor bug fix to the popup_calendar.pt edit macro.  There was a missing $
      for the call to the portal_url variable.  Thanks to Jim Baack for the fix.

1.0 - 2006-03-23

    - initial import into the Plone Software Center
