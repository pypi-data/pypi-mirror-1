Description: MCREPOGEN generates random version control histories. It uses a Markov Chain
        model to generate successive states of a directory tree. You can generate as
        many revisions as you want and the output is in the standard fast-import
        format. This means that MCREPOGEN-generated histories can be imported into many
        different version control systems to provide examples for testing.
