Notes on Creating a Release
===========================

These are intended to record the steps necessary to put out a release of
MCREPOGEN, a surprisingly long multi-step process.  They were developed from
the 0.2 release and will be used (and updated) starting with the 0.3 release.

Lanchpad
--------

1. Make a local release branch: mcrepogen-x.y
2. Push that to Launchpad lp:~<username>/mcrepogen/release-x.y
3. Make a release series x.y on Launchpad
4. Associate the series with the release-x.y branch
5. Add an x.y milestone to the x.y series

Building Packages
-----------------

1. On the release branch, update the version info to no longer be "dev".
2. Run ``python setup.py sdist`` in a clean export of the branch.
3. Push the release branch to Launchpad

Registering and Uploading
-------------------------

1. Run ``python setup.py register``.
2. Add the .tar.gz to the Launchpad milestone
3. Upload the .tar.gz to PyPI

Announcing
----------

1. Make a Launchpad announcement
2. For major improvements, consider a bazaar-announce message

Preparing for Further Development
---------------------------------

1. Bump the version number on the trunk
2. Push to Launchpad
