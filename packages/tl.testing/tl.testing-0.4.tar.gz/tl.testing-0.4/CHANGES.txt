=========================
Change log for tl.testing
=========================


0.4 (2009-09-14)
================

Cairo testing:
  - Updated to using manuel 1.0.0b3, restoring Python 2.5 compatibility.

  - Allowed for text in addition to the expression in figure captions, as well
    as multi-line captions.

  - Interpret an option for excluding one or more rectangular areas of a
    surface from comparison with the expected image.


0.3 (2009-07-23)
================

Cairo testing:
  - Updated to using manuel 1.0.0b2, implying the requirement of Python 2.6
    and a refactoring of the DocFileSuite that loses encoding support.

  - Improved the behaviour in the case that a result cannot be written to an
    image file.

  - Write the test result to an image file also in the case that the expected
    image cannot be loaded.

  - Disallowed absolute image paths as they would only work on Unix-like
    systems because of the requirement to use / as the path separator.

  - Fixed DocFileSuite to accept multiple test file names, renamed the
    ``manuel_object`` parameter to just ``manuel``, only include the doc test,
    footnote and cairo Manuels by default.

  - Require a cairo.ImageSurface instead of a Surface as the value of an
    example's Python expression.

  - Report ImageSurface format mismatches, avoid false mismatches with
    FORMAT_RGB24 surfaces.

Organisation:
  - Moved the project to the Mercurial version control system.

  - Build documentation using Sphinx.

  - Improved documentation, in particular added doc strings to the code.


0.2.2 (2009-06-24)
==================

- Updated to using the manuel 1.0.0b1 API.

- Made the cairo test runner recognize the CAIRO_TEST_RESULTS environment
  variable as a place to dump failed test results as png images.


0.2.1 (2009-06-09)
==================

- Use new ``manuel.codeblock`` functionality in cairo image doc-testing.

- Simplified the cairo testing code a little due to a bug fix in manuel.


0.2 (2009-05-15)
================

- Added a manuel test runner that compares cairo surfaces to images included
  as ReST figures in doc test files.


0.1 (2008-11-11)
================
