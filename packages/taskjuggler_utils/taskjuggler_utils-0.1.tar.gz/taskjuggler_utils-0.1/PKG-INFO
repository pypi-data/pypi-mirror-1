Description: Tools to help use "taskjuggler" without its GUI and produce nice reports.
        
        This package provides tools that will provide nice reports
        (taskjuggler-report), gantt charts (taskjuggler-gantt) and time shift
        the whole taskjuggler project file (taskjuggler-timeshift).
        
        The best thing is that you don't need to use Graphical User Interfaces
        for that, so these can be automated from cron jobs, web servers and
        makefiles.
        
        Reports are generated using LaTeX syntax since I use them in my LaTeX
        files easily, but we can easily add code to generate HTML reports as
        well in future.
