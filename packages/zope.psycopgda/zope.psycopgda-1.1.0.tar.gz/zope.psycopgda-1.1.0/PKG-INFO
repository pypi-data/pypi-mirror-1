        =========
        
        This file outlines the basics of using Zope3 with PostgreSQL via PsycopgDA.
        
        Installing PsycopgDA
        --------------------
        
        1. Check out the psycopgda package into a directory in your
        PYTHONPATH.  INSTANCE_HOME/lib/python or Zope3/src is usually the
        most convenient place:
        
        svn co svn://svn.zope.org/repos/main/psycopgda/trunk/psycopgda psycopgda
        
        2. Copy `psycopg-configure.zcml` to the `package-includes` directory
        of your Zope instance.
        
        
        You can also use the eggified version, by installing it sitewide:
        
        easy_install -U psycopgda
        
        If you're using buildout, just by listing psycopgda in the 'eggs' key
        of your buildout.cfg, then buildout should be able to find and fetch it.
        
        Creating Database Connections
        ------------------------------
        
        It is time to add some connections. A connection in Zope 3 is
        registered as a utility.
        
        3. Open a web browser on your Zope root folder (http://localhost:8080/
        if you use the default settings in zope.conf.in).
        
        4. Click on the 'Manage Site' action on the right side of the
        screen. You should see a screen which reads 'Common Site Management
        Tasks'
        
        5. Around the middle of that page, you should see a link named 'Add
        Utility'. Click on it.
        
        6. Select 'Psycopg DA' and type in a name at the bottom of the page.
        
        7. Enter the database connection string.  It looks like this:
        
        dbi://username:password@host:port/databasename
        
        8. Click on the 'Add' button.
        
        9. You should be on a page which reads 'Add Database Connection
        Registration'. There you can configure the permission needed to use
        the database connection, the name of the registration and the
        registration status. You can use any name for 'Register As' field,
        as long as it doesn't clash with an existing one. Choose a
        permission. Choose between 'Registered' and 'Active' for the
        'Registration Status'. Only one component of a kind can be 'Active'
        at a time, so be careful.
        
        10. You should be redirected to the 'Edit' screen of the connection
        utility.
        
        11. If you want to, you can go to the Test page and execute arbitrary
        SQL queries to see whether the connection is working as expected.
        
        
        Using SQL Scripts
        -----------------
        
        You can create SQL Scripts in the content space.  For example:
        
        12. Go to Zope root.
        
        13. Add an SQL script (you can use the Common Tasks box on the left,
        or the Add action on the right).
        
        14. Click on the name of your new SQL script.
        
        15. Choose a connection name (the one you entered in step 29) from the
        drop-down.
        
        16. Enter your query and click on the 'Save Changes' button.
        
        17. You can test the script in the -- surprise! -- Test page.
