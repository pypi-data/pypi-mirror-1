The enclosure class is a representation of an attachment for an item in a feed_entry.  This will be used for things like files.

If this doctest fails, you have probably changed the interface.

Create an enclosure that implements the IEnclosure interface.

>>> from vice.outbound.interfaces import IEnclosure
>>> from zope.interface import implements
>>> import datetime

>>> class Enclosure(object):
...     implements(IEnclosure)
...
...	def __init__(self, context):
...	    self.context = context
...     def mimeType(self):
...         return "text/plain"
...     def URL(self):
...         return "http://demente.dk"
...     def size(self):
...         return 45

>>> enc = Enclosure(object)

Make sure that the new object implements the IEnclosure interface, including all the methods in the interface.

>>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyObject
>>> verifyObject(IEnclosure, enc)
True
