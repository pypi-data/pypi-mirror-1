Description: 
        EatLint is a Trac__ plugin that adds a lint report summarizer and a lint chart to
        Bitten__.  This means that when a Bitten build that includes a lint step
        the output can not only be captured but reported on. The report shows
        the number of problems per file by category: convention, refactor,
        error, and warning as well as showing the totals for each file, for each
        category, and a grand-total showing the state of the entire project.
        Similarly the chart plugin charts the total number of problems as well
        as individual lines for each category. This gives you an idea of the
        readability of your project's code over time.

        Installation:
        
        Installation is done just as for any other Trac plugin.  Using the
        easy_install command from setuptools is the easiest (provided you have
        already setuptools installed)::
        
        easy_install eatlint
        
        After that you must configure your Trac project to use the plugin.  Edit
        conf/trac.ini in your Trac directory to include this::
        
        [components]
        eatlint.* = enabled
