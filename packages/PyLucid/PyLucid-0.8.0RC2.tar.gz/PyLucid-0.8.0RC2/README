PyLucid is a Open Source content management system (CMS) written in Python
using Django. A web based install is implemented, so no shell account is needed!
You only need a standard webserver with Python (at least v2.4) CGI and one of
the supported database engines (MySQL, SQLite3, Postgre, Oracle and MS-SQL) to
run PyLucid. Nearly all output can be customized.

PyLucid/django are WSGI conform, so you can run it as CGI, fastCGI, mod_Python
and others...
