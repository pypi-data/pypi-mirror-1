Documentation:

  * talk about py2exe and pyGTK issues
  * investigate myspell->hunspell move, check windows install and
    docs on installing dictionaries

PyEnchant:

  * implement a tkSpellCheckerDialog to compliment the wx one
  * Expand CmdLineChecker and make it ispell-compatible
  * try things out on OSX
  * pretty up the wxSpellCheckerDialog
  * try implementing the shared library with PyRex instead of SWIG,
    see if we get better performance/memory handling/etc
  * create/fillin README.txt in folders in the Windows distribution

Misc:

  * OSX install procedure:
       - http://www.tenon.com/resources/revised/X_apps_1.shtml for glib?
         Or possibly the gtk+osx project?
       - compile for oneself?
       - Needs:
            - libiconv?
            - pkg-config
            - glib
            - enchant
       - distribute as a .mpkg, build using py2app.
       - seems like most of the tools only available for >=10.3 ??

       * install pkgconfig
       * install libiconv
       * install gettext - ho-hum, crashes PearPC
