0.9.4 - Bugfix [20090709] [Daniel Kraft]

    - Forgot locales dir in packaging

0.9.3 - Feature release [20090709] [Oliver Roch, Daniel Kraft]

    - Fixed translation for batch_x_items_matching_your_criteria. Broken at least since 3.0 ("fuzzy").

0.9.2 - Feature release [20090709] [Oliver Roch, Daniel Kraft]

    - Removed the advanced search ("search_form") completely and traverse to search.
      This is because the search_form is just broken. It shows all portal_types
      even if they're configured not to be searched. This is especially ugly if you
      use ploneformgen or topics.

0.9.1 - Feature release [20090709] [Oliver Roch, Daniel Kraft]

    -  Added fix for livesearch. The "show all" and the "advanced search" links linked
       to the current context, which produces very small search results, because
       search is context sensitive. Now, the portal_url is used for the link.
       This was a bug, because the live-search IS NOT context sensitive usually.
       TODO: An even better bugfix would test if the checkbox (search here only) is active.

0.9 - Initial release [20090630] [Oliver Roch, Daniel Kraft]
