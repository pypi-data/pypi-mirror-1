Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Plone3 has many annoying style bugs. This package tries to fix as many as possible.
        
        The included fixes are:
        
        - Remove "* html" hacks from IEFixes.css to allow IE7 and IE8 to benefit
        from the fixes there.
        - Add the IE7ish behavour declaration into the main template to have IE8 to
        behave like IE7
        - Fix the order of the resourceregistries to have js after css to have a
        beautiful rendering in Firefox and to have a _real_ DomReady event in JS.
        - Fix livesearch. The "show all" and the "advanced search" links linked
        to the current context, which produces very small search results, because
        search is context sensitive. Now, the portal_url is used for the link.
        This was a bug, because the live-search IS NOT context sensitive usually.
        - Removed the advanced search ("search_form") completely and traverse to search.
        This is because the search_form is just broken. It shows all portal_types
        even if they're configured not to be searched. This is especially ugly if you
        use ploneformgen or topics.
        - Fixed translation for batch_x_items_matching_your_criteria. Broken at least since 3.0 ("fuzzy").
        
        
        Reasons
        =======
        
        The reason why we don't write bugreports is that nobody seems to care about them.
        Yes, we tried before.
