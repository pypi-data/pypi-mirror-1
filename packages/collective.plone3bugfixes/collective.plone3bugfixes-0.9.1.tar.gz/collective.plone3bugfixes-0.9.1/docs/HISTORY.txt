0.9.1 - Feature release [20090709] [Oliver Roch, Daniel Kraft]

    -  Added fix for livesearch. The "show all" and the "advanced search" links linked
       to the current context, which produces very small search results, because
       search is context sensitive. Now, the portal_url is used for the link.
       This was a bug, because the live-search IS NOT context sensitive.

0.9 - Initial release [20090630] [Oliver Roch, Daniel Kraft]
