engal

Engal is a simple photo gallery for TurboGears.

This is a TurboGears (http://www.turbogears.org) project. It can be
started by running the start-engal.py script.

Set the ENGAL_PATH environment variable to the directory in which your
prod.cfg lives.  Create an images directory and a cache directory in
that path.
