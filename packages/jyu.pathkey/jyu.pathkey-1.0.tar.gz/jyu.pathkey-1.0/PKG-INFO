Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        *Jyu.pathkey* was developed to situations where users have some content in Plone
        what they don't want to publish for whole world to see, but still want to share
        it with a number of people who doesn't necessarily have an user account to the
        plone site. With *jyu.pathkey* contents owner can set a pathkey for the folder
        and then share that with the people.
        
        *Jyu.pathkey* is not a bullet proof solution and was never intended to be. It simply
        adds user specified password (pathkey) as a new property of given folder and adds
        a hook to AfterTraverseEvent to check if user is trying to access protected content
        and request the pathkey when needed.
