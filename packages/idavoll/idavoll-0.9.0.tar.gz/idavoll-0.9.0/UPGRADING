Upgrading
=========

To 0.8.0
========

This release includes an optional HTTP interface with a gateway to subscribe
to remote nodes. The subscriptions and associated callbacks are stored in
the database if the PostgreSQL storage backend is used. This requires a new
table, of which the schema is in db/gateway.sql:

    psql -e pubsub <db/gateway.sql

The schema of the other tables has also changed significantly compared to
0.7.3 and older. For these changes, there is an upgrade script in the form
of a series of SQL statements to be run against an database with the older schema: db/to_idavoll_0.8.sql, like so:

    psql -e pubsub <db/to_idavoll_0.8.sql
