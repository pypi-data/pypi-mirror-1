p4a.file
========

p4a.file provides a field/widget pair for dealing with file-type objects.

File Field
----------

We begin by constructing a schema which uses the file field.

  >>> from zope import interface, schema
  >>> from p4a.fileimage import file
  >>> class IFoo(interface.Interface):
  ...     field1 = schema.TextLine(title=u'field1')
  ...     filefield = file.FileField(title=u'File Field')
