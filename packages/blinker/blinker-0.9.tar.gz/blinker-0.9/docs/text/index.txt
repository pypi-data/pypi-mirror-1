Blinker Documentation
*********************

Blinker provides fast & simple object-to-object and broadcast
signaling for Python objects.

The core of Blinker is quite small but provides powerful features:

   * a global registry of named signals

   * anonymous signals

   * custom name registries

   * permanently or temporarily connected receivers

   * automatically disconnected receivers via weak referencing

   * sending arbitrary data payloads

   * collecting return values from signal receivers


Requirements
============

Python 2.4 or later.  No other modules are required.

As of Blinker 0.8, Python 3.1 passes all tests except for weakly
binding to instance methods.
