If you are using Oracle 10g XE, use the "universal" version,
since the smaller Western European version has minimal support
for Unicode and will not pass all of the RelStorage tests.

Docs:

Excellent setup instructions:

Work around session limit (fixes ORA-12520):
    ALTER SYSTEM SET PROCESSES=150 SCOPE=SPFILE;
    ALTER SYSTEM SET SESSIONS=150 SCOPE=SPFILE;
    (then restart Oracle)

Manually rollback an in-dispute transaction:
    select local_tran_id, state from DBA_2PC_PENDING;
    rollback force '$local_tran_id';

It might be necessary to add the following lines to adapters/oracle.py,
before all imports, to solve Oracle encoding issues.  (Let me know
if you have to do this!)

    import os
    os.environ["NLS_LANG"] = ".AL32UTF8"
