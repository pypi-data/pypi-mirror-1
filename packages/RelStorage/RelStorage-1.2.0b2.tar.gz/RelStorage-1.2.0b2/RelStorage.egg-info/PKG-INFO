Description: 
        RelStorage is a storage implementation for ZODB that stores pickles in
        a relational database. PostgreSQL 8.1 and above (via psycopg2), MySQL
        5.0.32+ / 5.1.34+ (via MySQLdb 1.2.2 and above), and Oracle 10g (via
        cx_Oracle) are currently supported. RelStorage replaces the PGStorage
        project.

        Features
        ========
        
        * It is a drop-in replacement for FileStorage and ZEO.
        * There is a simple way to convert FileStorage to RelStorage and back again.
        You can also convert a RelStorage instance to a different relational database.
        * Designed for high volume sites: multiple ZODB instances can share the same
        database. This is similar to ZEO, but RelStorage does not require ZEO.
        * According to some tests, RelStorage handles high concurrency better than
        the standard combination of ZEO and FileStorage.
        * Whereas FileStorage takes longer to start as the database grows due to an
        in-memory index of all objects, RelStorage starts quickly regardless of
        database size.
        * Supports undo and packing.
        * Free, open source (ZPL 2.1)
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        You can install RelStorage using easy_install::
        
        easy_install RelStorage
        
        If you are not using easy_install (part of the setuptools package), you can
        get the latest release at PyPI (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/RelStorage), then
        place the relstorage package in the lib/python directory of either the
        SOFTWARE_HOME or the INSTANCE_HOME.  You can do this with the following
        command::
        
        python2.4 setup.py install --install-lib=${INSTANCE_HOME}/lib/python
        
        RelStorage requires a version of ZODB with the invalidation polling patch
        applied.  You can get versions of ZODB with the patch already applied here:
        
        http://packages.willowrise.org
        
        The patches are also included in the source distribution of RelStorage.
        
        You need the Python database adapter that corresponds with your database.
        Install psycopg2, MySQLdb 1.2.2+, or cx_Oracle 4.3+.  Note that Debian Etch
        ships MySQLdb 1.2.1, but that version has a bug in BLOB handling that manifests
        itself only with certain character set configurations.  MySQLdb 1.2.2 fixes the
        bug.
        
        Finally, modify etc/zope.conf of your Zope instance.  Remove the main mount
        point and add one of the following blocks.  For PostgreSQL::
        
        %import relstorage
        <zodb_db main>
        mount-point /
        <relstorage>
        <postgresql>
        # The dsn is optional, as are each of the parameters in the dsn.
        dsn dbname='zodb' user='username' host='localhost' password='pass'
        </postgresql>
        </relstorage>
        </zodb_db>
        
        For MySQL::
        
        %import relstorage
        <zodb_db main>
        mount-point /
        <relstorage>
        <mysql>
        # Most of the options provided by MySQLdb are available.
        # See component.xml.
        db zodb
        </mysql>
        </relstorage>
        </zodb_db>
        
        For Oracle (10g XE in this example)::
        
        %import relstorage
        <zodb_db main>
        mount-point /
        <relstorage>
        <oracle>
        user username
        password pass
        dsn XE
        </oracle>
        </relstorage>
        </zodb_db>
        
        
        Migration
        =========
        
        Migrating from FileStorage
        --------------------------
        
        You can convert a FileStorage instance to RelStorage and back using a utility
        called ZODBConvert.  See http://wiki.zope.org/ZODB/ZODBConvert .
        
        
        Migrating from PGStorage
        ------------------------
        
        The following script migrates your database from PGStorage to RelStorage 1.0
        beta:
        
        migrate.sql_
        
        .. _migrate.sql: http://svn.zope.org/*checkout*/relstorage/trunk/notes/migrate.sql
        
        After you do this, you still need to migrate from 1.0 beta to the latest
        release.
        
        
        Migrating to a new version of RelStorage
        ----------------------------------------
        
        Sometimes RelStorage needs a schema modification along with a software
        upgrade.  Hopefully, this will not often be necessary.
        
        Version 1.2.0b1 does not require a schema migration from version 1.1.3.
        
        To migrate from version 1.1.1 to version 1.1.2 or 1.1.3, see:
        
        migrate-to-1.1.2.txt_
        
        .. _migrate-to-1.1.2.txt: http://svn.zope.org/*checkout*/relstorage/trunk/notes/migrate-to-1.1.2.txt
        
        To migrate from version 1.1 to version 1.1.1, see:
        
        migrate-to-1.1.1.txt_
        
        .. _migrate-to-1.1.1.txt: http://svn.zope.org/*checkout*/relstorage/trunk/notes/migrate-to-1.1.1.txt
        
        To migrate from version 1.0.1 to version 1.1, see:
        
        migrate-to-1.1.txt_
        
        .. _migrate-to-1.1.txt: http://svn.zope.org/*checkout*/relstorage/trunk/notes/migrate-to-1.1.txt
        
        To migrate from version 1.0 beta to version 1.0c1 through 1.0.1, see:
        
        migrate-to-1.0.txt_
        
        .. _migrate-to-1.0.txt: http://svn.zope.org/*checkout*/relstorage/trunk/notes/migrate-to-1.0.txt
        
        
        Optional Features
        =================
        
        Specify these options in zope.conf, as parameters for the RelStorage
        constructor, or as attributes of a relstorage.Options instance.
        In the latter two cases, use underscores instead of dashes in the
        parameter names.
        
        poll-interval
        
        Defer polling the database for the specified maximum time interval,
        in seconds.  Set to 0 (the default) to always poll.  Fractional
        seconds are allowed.  Use this to lighten the database load on
        servers with high read volume and low write volume.
        
        The poll-interval option works best in conjunction with
        the cache-servers option.  If both are enabled, RelStorage will
        poll a single cache key for changes on every request.
        The database will not be polled unless the cache indicates
        there have been changes, or the timeout specified by poll-interval
        has expired.  This configuration keeps clients fully up to date,
        while removing much of the polling burden from the database.
        A good cluster configuration is to use memcache servers
        and a high poll-interval (say, 60 seconds).
        
        This option can be used without the cache-servers option,
        but a large poll-interval without cache-servers increases the
        probability of basing transactions on stale data, which does not
        affect database consistency, but does increase the probability
        of conflict errors, leading to low performance.
        
        pack-gc
        
        If pack-gc is false, pack operations do not perform
        garbage collection.  Garbage collection is enabled by default.
        
        If garbage collection is disabled, pack operations keep at least one
        revision of every object.  With garbage collection disabled, the
        pack code does not need to follow object references, making
        packing conceivably much faster.  However, some of that benefit
        may be lost due to an ever increasing number of unused objects.
        
        Disabling garbage collection is also a hack that ensures
        inter-database references never break.
        
        pack-dry-run
        
        If pack-dry-run is true, pack operations perform a full analysis
        of what to pack, but no data is actually removed.  After a dry run,
        the pack_object, pack_state, and pack_state_tid tables are filled
        with the list of object states and objects that would have been
        removed.
        
        pack-batch-timeout
        
        Packing occurs in batches of transactions; this specifies the
        timeout in seconds for each batch.  Note that some database
        configurations have unpredictable I/O performance
        and might stall much longer than the timeout.
        The default timeout is 5.0 seconds.
        
        pack-duty-cycle
        
        After each batch, the pack code pauses for a time to
        allow concurrent transactions to commit.  The pack-duty-cycle
        specifies what fraction of time should be spent on packing.
        For example, if the duty cycle is 0.75, then 75% of the time
        will be spent packing: a 6 second pack batch
        will be followed by a 2 second delay.  The duty cycle should
        be greater than 0.0 and less than or equal to 1.0.  Specify
        1.0 for no delay between batches.
        
        The default is 0.5.  Raise it to finish packing faster; lower it
        to reduce the effect of packing on transaction commit performance.
        
        pack-max-delay
        
        This specifies a maximum delay between pack batches.  Sometimes
        the database takes an extra long time to finish a pack batch; at
        those times it is useful to cap the delay imposed by the
        pack-duty-cycle.  The default is 20 seconds.
        
        cache-servers
        
        Specifies a list of memcache servers.  Enabling memcache integration
        is useful if the connection to the relational database has high
        latency and the connection to memcache has significantly lower
        latency.  On the other hand, if the connection to the relational
        database already has low latency, memcache integration may actually
        hurt overall performance.
        
        Provide a list of host:port pairs, separated by whitespace.
        "127.0.0.1:11211" is a common setting.  The default is to disable
        memcache integration.
        
        cache-module-name
        
        Specifies which Python memcache module to use.  The default is
        "memcache", a pure Python module.  There are several alternative
        modules available through PyPI.  This setting has no effect unless
        cache-servers is set.
        
        Development
        ===========
        
        You can checkout from Subversion using the following command::
        
        svn co svn://svn.zope.org/repos/main/relstorage/trunk RelStorage
        
        You can also browse the code:
        
        http://svn.zope.org/relstorage/trunk/
        
        The best place to discuss development of RelStorage is on the zodb-dev
        mailing list.
        
        
        
        FAQs
        ====
        
        Q: How can I help improve RelStorage?
        
        A: The best way to help is to test and to provide database-specific
        expertise.  Ask questions about RelStorage on the zodb-dev mailing list.
        
        Q: Can I perform SQL queries on the data in the database?
        
        A: No.  Like FileStorage and DirectoryStorage, RelStorage stores the data
        as pickles, making it hard for anything but ZODB to interpret the data.  An
        earlier project called Ape attempted to store data in a truly relational
        way, but it turned out that Ape worked too much against ZODB principles and
        therefore could not be made reliable enough for production use.  RelStorage,
        on the other hand, is much closer to an ordinary ZODB storage, and is
        therefore much safer for production use.
        
        Q: How does RelStorage performance compare with FileStorage?
        
        A: According to benchmarks, RelStorage with PostgreSQL is often faster than
        FileStorage, especially under high concurrency.
        
        Q: Why should I choose RelStorage?
        
        A: Because RelStorage is a fairly small layer that builds on world-class
        databases.  These databases have proven reliability and scalability, along
        with numerous support options.
        
        Q: Can RelStorage replace ZRS (Zope Replication Services)?
        
        A: In theory, yes.  With RelStorage, you can use the replication features
        native to your database.  However, this capability has not yet been tested.

        Change History
        ==============
        
        
        Version 1.2.0b2 (2009-05-05)
        ----------------------------
        
        - RelStorage now implements IMVCCStorage, making it compatible with
        ZODB 3.9.0b1 and above.
        
        - Removed two-phase commit support from the PostgreSQL adapter. The
        feature turned out to be unnecessary.
        
        - Added MySQL 5.1.34 and above to the list of supportable databases.
        
        - Fixed minor test failures under Windows. Windows is now a supportable
        platform.
        
        
        Version 1.1.3 (2009-02-04)
        --------------------------
        
        - In rare circumstances, ZODB can legitimately commit an object twice in a
        single transaction.  Fixed RelStorage to accept that.
        
        - Auto reconnect to Oracle sometimes did not work because cx_Oracle was
        raising a different kind of exception than expected.  Fixed.
        
        - Included LICENSE.txt in the source distribution.
        
        
        Version 1.1.2 (2009-01-27)
        --------------------------
        
        - When both cache-servers and poll-interval are set, we now poll the
        cache for changes on every request.  This makes it possible to use
        a high poll-interval to reduce the database polling burden, yet
        every client can see changes immediately.
        
        - Added the pack-dry-run option, which causes pack operations to only
        populate the pack tables with the list of objects and states to pack,
        but not actually pack.
        
        - Refined the pack algorithm.  It was not removing as many object states
        as it should have.  As a bonus, there is now a method of adapters called
        fill_object_refs(), which could be useful for debugging.  It ensures the
        object_ref table is fully populated.
        
        - Began using zc.buildout for development.
        
        - Increased automated test coverage.
        
        - Fixed KeyError reporting to not trip over a related KeyError while logging.
        
        
        Version 1.1.1 (2008-12-27)
        --------------------------
        
        - Worked around MySQL performance bugs in packing.  Used temporary
        tables and another column in the pack_object table.  The
        other databases may benefit from the optimization as well.
        
        - Applied an optimization using setinputsizes() to the Oracle code,
        bringing write speed back up to where it was in version 1.0.
        
        
        Version 1.1 (2008-12-19)
        ------------------------
        
        - Normalized poll-invalidation patches as Solaris' patch command would not
        accept the current format. The patches now apply with:
        patch -d lib/python/ZODB -p0 < poll-invalidation-1-zodb-3-X-X.patch
        
        - In MySQL, Use DROP TABLE IF EXISTS instead of TRUNCATE to clear 'temp_store'
        because:
        
        - TRUNCATE has one page of caveats in the MySQL documentation.
        - TEMPORARY TABLEs have half a page of caveats when it comes to
        replication.
        - The end result is that 'temp_store' may not exist on the
        replication slave at the exact same time(s) it exists on the
        master.
        
        - Implemented the database size query in MySQL, based on a patch from
        Kazuhiko Shiozaki.  Thanks!
        
        - Optimized Oracle object retrieval by causing BLOBs to be sent inline
        when possible, based on a patch by Helge Tesdal.  By default, the
        optimization is activated automatically when cx_Oracle 5 is used.
        
        - Updated the storage iterator code to be compatible with ZODB 3.9.
        The RelStorage tests now pass with the shane-poll-invalidations branch
        of ZODB 3.9.
        
        - Added a translation of README.txt to Brazilian Portuguese by
        Rogerio Ferreira.  Thanks!
        
        
        Version 1.1c1
        -------------
        
        - Added optional memcache integration.  This is useful when the connection
        to the relational database has high latency.
        
        - Made it possible to set the pack and memcache options in zope.conf.
        
        - Log more info when a KeyError occurs within RelStorage.
        
        
        Version 1.1b2
        -------------
        
        - Made the MySQL locks database-specific rather than server-wide.  This is
        important for multi-database configurations.
        
        - In the PostgreSQL adapter, made the pack lock fall back to table locking
        rather than advisory locks for PostgreSQL 8.1.
        
        - Changed a query for following object references (used during packing)
        to work around a MySQL performance bug.  Thanks to Anton Stonor for
        discovering this.
        
        
        Version 1.1b1
        -------------
        
        - Fixed the use of setup.py without setuptools.  Thanks to Chris Withers.
        
        - Fixed type coercion of the transaction extension field.  This fixes
        an issue with converting databases.  Thanks to Kevin Smith for
        discovering this.
        
        - Added logging to the pack code to help diagnose performance issues.
        
        - Additions to the object_ref table are now periodically committed
        during pre_pack so that the work is not lost if pre_pack fails.
        
        - Modified the pack code to pack one transaction at a time and
        release the commit lock frequently.  This should help large pack
        operations.
        
        - Fixed buildout-based installation of the zodbconvert script.  Thanks to
        Jim Fulton.
        
        
        Version 1.0.1
        -------------
        
        - The speedtest script failed if run on a test database that has no tables.
        Now the script creates the tables if needed.  Thanks to Flavio Coelho
        for discovering this.
        
        - Reworked the auto-reconnect logic so that applications never see
        temporary database disconnects if possible.  Thanks to Rigel Di Scala
        for pointing out this issue.
        
        - Improved the log messages explaining database connection failures.
        
        - Moved poll_invalidations to the common adapter base class, reducing the
        amount of code to maintain.
        
        
        Version 1.0
        -----------
        
        - Added a utility for converting between storages called zodbconvert.
        
        
        Version 1.0c1
        -------------
        
        - The previous fix for non-ASCII characters was incorrect.  Now transaction
        metadata is stored as raw bytes.  A schema migration is required; see
        notes/migrate-1.0-beta.txt.
        
        - Integrated setuptools and made an egg.
        
        
        Version 1.0 beta
        ----------------
        
        - Renamed to reflect expanding database support.
        
        - Added support for Oracle 10g.
        
        - Major overhaul with many scalability and reliability improvements,
        particularly in the area of packing.
        
        - Moved to svn.zope.org and switched to ZPL 2.1.
        
        - Made two-phase commit optional in both Oracle and PostgreSQL.  They
        both use commit_lock in such a way that the commit is not likely to
        fail in the second phase.
        
        - Switched most database transaction isolation levels from serializable
        to read committed.  It turns out that commit_lock already provides
        the serializability guarantees we need, so it is safe to take advantage
        of the potential speed gains.  The one major exception is the load
        connection, which requires an unchanging view of the database.
        
        - Stored objects are now buffered in a database table rather than a file.
        
        - Stopped using the LISTEN and NOTIFY statements in PostgreSQL since
        they are not strictly transactional in the sense we require.
        
        - Started using a prepared statement in PostgreSQL for getting the
        newest transaction ID quickly.
        
        - Removed the code in the Oracle adapter for retrying connection attempts.
        (It is better to just reconfigure Oracle.)
        
        - Added support for MySQL 5.0.
        
        - Added the poll_interval option.  It reduces the frequency of database
        polls, but it also increases the potential for conflict errors on
        servers with high write volume.
        
        - Implemented the storage iterator protocol, making it possible to copy
        transactions to and from FileStorage and other RelStorage instances.
        
        - Fixed a bug that caused OIDs to be reused after importing transactions.
        Added a corresponding test.
        
        - Made it possible to disable garbage collection during packing.
        Exposed the option in zope.conf.
        
        - Valery Suhomlinov discovered a problem with non-ASCII data in transaction
        metadata.  The problem has been fixed for all supported databases.
        
        
        PGStorage history
        =================
        
        Version 0.4
        -----------
        
        - Began using the PostgreSQL LISTEN and NOTIFY statements as a shortcut
        for invalidation polling.
        
        - Removed the commit_order code.  The commit_order idea was intended to
        allow concurrent commits, but that idea is a little too ambitious while
        other more important ideas are being tested.  Something like it may
        come later.
        
        - Improved connection management: only one database connection is
        held continuously open per storage instance.
        
        - Reconnect to the database automatically.
        
        - Removed test mode.
        
        - Switched from using a ZODB.Connection subclass to a ZODB patch.  The
        Connection class changes in subtle ways too often to subclass reliably;
        a patch is much safer.
        
        - PostgreSQL 8.1 is now a dependency because PGStorage uses two phase commit.
        
        - Fixed an undo bug.  Symptom: attempting to examine the undo log revealed
        broken pickles.  Cause: the extension field was not being wrapped in
        psycopg2.Binary upon insert.  Solution: used psycopg2.Binary.
        Unfortunately, this doesn't fix existing transactions people have
        committed.  If anyone has any data to keep, fixing the old transactions
        should be easy.
        
        - Moved from a private CVS repository to Sourceforge.
        See http://pgstorage.sourceforge.net .  Also switched to the MIT license.
        
        - David Pratt added a basic getSize() implementation so that the Zope
        management interface displays an estimate of the size of the database.
        
        - Turned PGStorage into a top-level package.  Python generally makes
        top-level packages easier to install.
        
        
        Version 0.3
        -----------
        
        - Made compatible with Zope 3, although an undo bug apparently remains.
        
        
        Version 0.2
        -----------
        
        - Fixed concurrent commits, which were generating deadlocks.  Fixed by
        adding a special table, "commit_lock", which is used for
        synchronizing increments of commit_seq (but only at final commit.)
        If you are upgrading from version 0.1, you need to change your
        database using the 'psql' prompt:
        
        create table commit_lock ();
        
        - Added speed tests and an OpenDocument spreadsheet comparing
        FileStorage / ZEO with PGStorage.  PGStorage wins at reading objects
        and writing a lot of small transactions, while FileStorage / ZEO
        wins at writing big transactions.  Interestingly, they tie when
        writing a RAM disk.
