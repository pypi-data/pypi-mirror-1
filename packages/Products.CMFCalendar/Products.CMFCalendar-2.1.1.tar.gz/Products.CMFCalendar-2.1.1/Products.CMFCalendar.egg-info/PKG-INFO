        CMFCalendar README
        
        The CMFCalendar product is an example of creating a CMF
        Product.  The CMFCalendar product is also expected to be a
        generally useful out of the 'box' and skinnable to accomodate
        customization within your existing CMF instance.  To see how to
        go about building a CMF product, this hopefully allows a
        developer to follow through the process of registering their
        product, skins, and help with the CMF by example.  It shows how
        an object is created and registered with the types_tool,
        necessary skins added to the skins_tool, with the Calendar
        skins directory added to the skin paths, and providing
        portal_metadatool with an Element policy for the content_type
        of the object.
        
        The event portal_type is complete, and can be stand alone, but
        now accompanyied by the CMFCalendar which is fully functional
        and tested.
        
        For installing set the 'active site configuration' of your site's
        setup tool to the CMFCalendar profile and import all steps.
        
        After installing the CMFCalendar you should notice a calendar
        appear in your CMF.  This is fully customisable to your portals
        needs.
