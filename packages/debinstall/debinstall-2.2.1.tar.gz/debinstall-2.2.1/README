Tool to manipulate Debian package repositories.


Before creating repositories; please edit the /etc/debinstall/debinstallrc file.
Here are the description of the fields:

		[debinstall]
		group=<system group which packages will belong to>
		origin=<set an informative message>

		[create]
		destination=<where the remote repositories are>
		configurations=<where the configuration files are/var/lib/debinstall
		default_distribution=<the default distribution if option is missing>

		[upload]
		check_signature=<check gpg signature of the .changes files>
		checkers=<list of debian checkers as lintian, ...>

		[publish]
		sign_repo=<sign the repository by the publisher>
		keyid=<gpg id of the publisher>
		check_signature=<check gpg signature of the .changes files>
		checkers=<list of debian checkers as lintian, ...>

		[archive]
		archivedir=<not used>

Then, you need to invoke `ldi configure` to create initial directories. Then, if you change some values, please re-run this command and you have to clean up old directory yourself.

	% ldi configure


Now, you can add new repositories::

	% ldi create $REPOSITORY -d unstable,stable
	% ldi create $REPOSITORY -d hardy


To upload new packages in incoming queue, use::

	% ldi upload $REPOSITORY <debian_changes_file>.changes


Finally, the publisher can now refresh the public repository with::

	% ldi publish $REPOSITORY


Read `man ldi` and read documentation in doc/ for more information.
