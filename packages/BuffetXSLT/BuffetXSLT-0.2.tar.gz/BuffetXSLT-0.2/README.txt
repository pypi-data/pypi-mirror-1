This is a templating plugin that enables XSL templating.  

The original code was from Buffet 0.4 and was written by Sylvain Hellegouarch.  I (Christian Wyglendowski) converted the code to the templating plugin.

The plugin requires the Amara package available at http://4suite.org/index.xhtml.

Version History:

0.2 - made sure that a new processor was instantiated after each run of the plugin.
0.1 - initial conversion of Sylvain's code to a plugin.
