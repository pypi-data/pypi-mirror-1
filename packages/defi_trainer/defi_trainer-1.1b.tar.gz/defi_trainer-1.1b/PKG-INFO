Description: DefiTrainer is a light-weight definition trainer. I created it to learn definitions and facts for university. DefiTrainer parses RestructuredText and asks for definition basedon definiitons and low-level section elements.
        My intention was to reuse my notes which I usually write in RST.  I didn't want to create a second file which can be used by a training program.
