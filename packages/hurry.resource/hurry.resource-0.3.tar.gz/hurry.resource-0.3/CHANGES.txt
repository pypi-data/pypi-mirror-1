0.3 (2008-10-15)
================

Features added
--------------

* Consolidating resources into rollups is now disabled by
  default. This is to help developers with debugging; rollups are
  typically minified for optimization purposes, and libraries such as
  YUI do not offer rollups in non-minified form. Since rollups must
  now be explicitly enabled by the application developer
  (``hurry.resource.rollup()``), an application developer who needs to
  debug can choose not to call it (or call
  ``hurry.resource.rollup(disable=True``).

* Added an optimization section to the documentation.

* Added some more details about how modes are expected to be used to
  the documentation.

Bug fixes
---------

* ``hurry.resource.bottom`` now takes a second optional ``disable``
  parameter.

0.2 (2008-10-13)
================

* Changed the API to set the mode. Instead of passing it to ``render``
  and ``inclusions``, the requested mode can be set with the ``mode``
  method on ``INeededInclusions``. For convenience there is a ``mode``
  function as well that can be imported directly from
  ``hurry.resource`` that sets the mode for the current needed
  inclusions.

* Added support for rendering resources into two fragments, one to
  be included at the top of the HTML page in the ``<head>`` section,
  the other to be included just before the ``</body>`` section. In 
  some circumstances doing this can `speed up page load time`_.
