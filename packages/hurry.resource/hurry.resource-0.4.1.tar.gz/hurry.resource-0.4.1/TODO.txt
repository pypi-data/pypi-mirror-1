* Sometimes it would be nice to be able to *replace* a resource
  entirely with another. An example is ``z3c.listjs.listjs_css``,
  which only defines the CSS for the up and down button. You can
  currently define a new resource that depends on this which uses CSS
  rules to override things, and perhaps that's all right, but
  sometimes replacing the resource entirely would be better (and more
  efficient for page load times).

* For performance reasons it would be nice if we could somehow support
  auto-rollup for resources. See also Malthe's ``repoze.squeeze``.
