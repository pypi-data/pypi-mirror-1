0.2 (2008-10-13)
================

* Changed the API to set the mode. Instead of passing it to ``render``
  and ``inclusions``, the requested mode can be set with the ``mode``
  method on ``INeededInclusions``. For convenience there is a ``mode``
  function as well that can be imported directly from
  ``hurry.resource`` that sets the mode for the current needed
  inclusions.

* Added support for rendering resources into two fragments, one to
  be included at the top of the HTML page in the ``<head>`` section,
  the other to be included just before the ``</body>`` section. In 
  some circumstances doing this can `speed up page load time`_.
