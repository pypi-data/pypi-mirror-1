1.3b1 (2009-03-16)
------------------

* Changed the implementation of OrderedDict to store the order in buckets
  using zc.blist. At present, this improves performance only for those
  operations that add or remove single items of an OrderedDict. Reordering the
  existing items still results in the order being rewritten as a whole. A
  better, more granular reordering API is planned for a future release.

1.2.1 (2007-3-5)
----------------

* documented, fixed, and tested intended subclassing story

* documented and tested support for old DBs with instances of OrderedDict

1.2 (2007-3-5)
--------------

* bug fix: ``pop`` and ``setdefault`` did not correctly adjust _len

* bug fix: ``setdefault`` did not return value

* feature: ``update`` now supports full dict behavior

* feature: ordered dict now has all dict methods

* tests: added fuller test suite for ordered dict

* docs: mentioned some performance and behavior characteristics of Dict and
  OrderedDict

* change: moved OrderedDict into dict.py and made it a subclass.  Left a stub
  for old ZODBs in ordered.py.

* change: ``__del__`` defers to ``pop``.

1.1 (2007-12-16)
----------------

* Added OrderedDict class that maintains the order in which items are added.
