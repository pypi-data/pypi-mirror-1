    - Fixed viewing of maps if the workflow state was 'private'. There is a
      new interface and view which only has the 'enabled' attribute and which
      is accessible without restriction. This is now used as the condition in
      portal_javascripts.

      widget for it now uses two input fields.

Maps 1.0 - May 03, 2007

    - Changed the markup. All markers are in one definition list instead of
      one marker in one list. A dt with class="title" marks the beginning of
      a new marker.
      [fschulze]

    - Added support for layers. The default is to take keywords as the name
      of the layer in which a marker is visible. Then you get a map control
      with checkboxes for each keyword and you can view/hide the markers with
      that.
