Description: This module supports the calculation of ISBN checksums with
        ``calculate_checksum()``, the conversion between ISBN-10 and ISBN-13 with
        ``convert()`` and the validation of ISBNs with ``validate()``.
        
        All the ISBNs must be passed in as ``str`` types, even if it would seem
        reasonable to accept some ``int`` forms.  The reason behind this is English
        speaking countries use ``0`` for their group identifier, and Python would treat
        ISBNs beginning with ``0`` as octal representations producing incorrect results.
        While it may be feasible to allow some cases as non-``str`` types the complexity
        in design and usage isn't worth the minimal benefit.
        
        The functions in this module also support 9-digit SBNs for people with older
        books in their collection.
