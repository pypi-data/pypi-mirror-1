List of changes since 0.1 release:

* Make page existence and setPageInfo() checks more consistent.
* Use **kwargs in Page.edit() rather than dozen keyword arguments all False by default,
  this is a breaking change for anything didn't explicitly use the keyword arguments 
  for some reason. If the first param isn't a keyword, its treated as "text" for partial BC,
  arguments are now all the same as the API action=edit params, "newtext" and "basetime" 
  still work for BC 
* Fix broken User.page 
* APIRequest now makes a copy() of params rather than using it directly 		
* reduce calls to setPageInfo() by using the title if pageid isn't available
* Make redirect following less random on calls to setPageInfo in Page - 
  note that this removes the followRedir param from setPageInfo, replacing it with
  a followRedir member variable	
* set maxlag directly in the query params for temporary raises for login/siteinfo queries
  rather than using setmaxlag(), which could reset it back to 5 if the user set it to 120
  before logging in
* fix maxlag bug that changed it to 120 but didn't reset it back to 5		
* rewrite most of __longQuery and improve resultCombine		
* add missing module import in api.py	
* use pickle for cookie files, add an option to login() to verify the cookies are correct
  with isLoggedIn(), set to True by default	
* fix User.isIP check - several non IPs were treated as IP addresses	
* support reblock option for user blocks		
* improve namespace guessing/title normalization, include namespace aliases,
  add the namespace prefix to category objects if its not already there
