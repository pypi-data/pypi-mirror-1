   (name of developer listed in brackets)

statusmessages 3.0.1 - Released October 7, 2007

    - Added the IAttributeAnnotatable interface assignment for the request

      rely on it.

statusmessages 3.0rc1 - Released July 10, 2007

      [hannosch]

statusmessages 3.0b2 - Released March 23, 2007

    - Fixed duplicate message bug. Showing identical messages to the end user
      more than once, doesn't make any sense. This closes
      http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6109.
      [hannosch]

    - Added 's support for statusmessages without a redirect. This uses
      annotations on the request instead of direct values, so we avoid the
      possibility of sneaking those in via query strings.

statusmessages 3.0b1 - Released March 5, 2007

    - Converted to a package in the Products namespace.
      [hannosch]

    - Added explicit translation of statusmessages before storing them in the
      cookie. This makes sure we have a reasonable context to base the
      translation on.
      [hannosch]

    - Changed license to BSD, to make it possible to include it as a dependency
      in Archetypes.
      [hannosch]

statusmessages 2.1 - Released October 25, 2006

    - Updated test infrastructure, removed custom testrunner.
      [hannosch]

    - Fixed deprecation warning for the zcml content directive.
      [hannosch]

statusmessages 2.0 - Released May 15, 2006

    - Total reimplementation using cookies instead of a server-side in-memory
      storage to store status messages. The reasoning behind this change is that
      the former approach didn't play well with web caching strategies and added
      an additional burden in ZEO environments (having to use load-balancers,
      which are able to identify users and keep them connected to the same ZEO
      server).

    - Added tests for ThreadSafeDict.
      [hannosch]

    - Fixed serious memory leak and did some code improvements.
      [hannosch] [alecm]

statusmessages 1.0 - Released January 26, 2006
