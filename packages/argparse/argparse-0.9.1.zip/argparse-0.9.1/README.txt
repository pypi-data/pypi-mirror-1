argparse 0.9.1
==============

The argparse module makes writing command line tools in Python easy.
Just briefly describe your command line interface and argparse will
take care of the rest, including:

* parsing the arguments and flags from ``sys.argv``
* converting arg strings into objects for your program
* formatting and printing any help messages
* and much more ... 

For those familiar with the optparse module from the Python standard
library, argparse improves on this module in a number of ways,
including:

    * handling positional arguments
    * supporting sub-commands
    * allowing alternative option prefixes like ``+`` and ``/``
    * handling zero-or-more and one-or-more style arguments
    * producing more informative usage messages
    * providing a much simpler interface for custom types and actions
