        - Handle case of egg contained types if no product is set on fti at
        getDefaultAddableTypes.

        - Switched __getitem__ to __getattr__ in FauxArchetypeTool. This makes it look
        up attributes on the real tool, which makes acquisition work again.

        - Added _setObject method from OFS, don't fire events by default.
