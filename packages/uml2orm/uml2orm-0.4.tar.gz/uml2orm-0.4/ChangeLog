v0.4:
    UML Classes that are generalized from others are correctly the last
    classes written at generated code now, before this would case NameError;

    uml2orm_cg script has been updated, now it supports passing output files
    and passing what ORM code to generate aswell what SQL code to generate;

    Fixed a wrong check done in uml2orm/umlparser/xmi.py;

    Fixed wrong syntax for SQLite error messages;

v0.3:
    Fixed wrong class generation in case there were no attributes to 
    be initialized;

    Added support for XMI files (tested only with XMI files generated 
    by Umbrello);

    Operations defined as "pk" at UML design are not an argument at class
    initialization anymore (supposing they are auto-incremented). This may
    change in the future by adding something more explicit to the "pk"
    operation (like "auto-increment" or "ai" or something like that).
