Description: It requires `pysvn` which you will probably want to install system-wide[1].
        
        Alternatively, you can use Sven with mercurial. This is highly experimental
        at present. Look at ./sven/hg-doctest.txt for details. Sven's hg interface
        is (mostly) the same as the svn interface.
        
        Basic usage:
        
        from sven.backend import SvnAccess
        client = SvnAccess(my_svn_server_repo_uri, my_local_checkout_dir)
        
        client.write('path/to/a/file/to/write', "Lovely content to be versioning!")
        client.write('path/to/another/file', "Aw shucks, I'll version this too..",
        msg="My commit message", kind='text/plain')
        
        last_rev_int = client.last_changed_rev('path/to/another/file')
        
        last_rev_int = last_rev_int - 1
        from sven.exc import ResourceUnchanged
        try:
        earlier_version = client.read('path/to/another/file', rev=last_rev_int)
        except ResourceUnchanged, exc:
        last_rev_int = exc.last_change
        earlier_version = client.read('path/to/another/file', rev=last_rev_int)
        
        changelog = client.log('path/to/another/file', rev=last_rev_int)
        
        Each `.write` writes the content to the path on the local filesystem's checkout
        and then commits it to the repository. The workflow of one-write-per-commit is
        by design and is not likely to change soon; if you need a different workflow,
        you probably ought to just be using svn clients directly, anyway.
        
        Currently sven does not help you set up an svn client or server.  It assumes
        you've already got a repository and checkout set up.
        
        The formats returned by some of its methods (particularly .log and .ls) are
        totally ad-hoc right now and strange; they'll probably be formalized sooner
        or later.
        
        For more detailed usage documentation please see ./sven/doctest.txt (which
        can be run as a test suite by `python sven/backend.py`)
        
        [1] If you start to experience Segmentation faults while using sven, especially
        during .write operations, your versions of ``svn`` and ``pysvn`` are likely
        incompatible (e.g. svn 1.5 with pysvn compiled against your earlier svn 1.4)
        If this happens, you should uninstall pysvn, then compile it from source.
        You might want to test for this upfront by running the test suite:
        python sven/backend.py
        
        
        New in version 0.6:
        
        * SvnBackend.__init__ no longer takes a 'svnuri' argument to the
        remote repository as its first positional argument; it's not
        used anywhere. This is a backwards-incompatible change.
        
        * The strange ad-hoc JSONish object returned by SvnAccess.ls had an
        extra `/` prefixed to the object's 'href' erroneously; now fixed.
        
        * Experimental implementation of the Sven API for Mercurial backends
        now lives in sven.hg.HgAccess; it is documented in hg-doctest.txt
        and has a few small differences from the SvnAccess backend. It is
        highly incomplete (think of it as an alpha stage) and requires
        `mercurial` to be installed. Sven does not install mercurial, just
        like it doesn't install pysvn.
        
        
        History:
        
        0.5
        ===
        
        The 0.5 release does not exist. Sven went straight to 0.6 after 0.4.1
        with some backwards-incompatible changes.
        
        0.4.1 (2009-08-10)
        ==================
        
        * Fixed several embarrassing typos in the 0.4 release
        
        0.4 (2009-08-10)
        ================
        
        * Added simple_backend.FSAccess class, which partially implements
        the SVNAccess API, but on a plain old filesystem. Needs tests
        and documentation, among other things (e.g. justification)
        
        * Refactored SvnAccess to split out recently-added options for
        update_before/after_write into logically separate component
        
        * SvnAccess.set_kind and .write now return the pysvn.Revision of
        the (last) commit instead of None
        
        * Added SvnAccessEventEmitter class which executes a list of callback
        functions at the end of every successful .write and .set_kind action
        
        Callbacks should have the signature
        (uri, contents, msg, kind, (pre_rev, post_rev))
        
        
        0.3.1 (2009-07-28)
        ==================
        
        * Fixed bug: SvnAccess.ls was returning its contents with absolute URIs,
        rather than URIs relative to the root of the repository.
        
        
        0.3 (2009-07-25)
        ================
        
        * Removed `SvnAccess.update_after_write` knob and instead set default value of True
        to the `update_after_write` argument to `SvnAccess.write`; callers can implement
        alternatives trivially by subclassing.
        
        * Added `update_before_write` argument to .write with default value of True. Turn
        this off as well as `update_after_write` if you want to manage synchronicity in
        exchange for potentially significant performance improvements.
        
        * Added `default_commit_message` argument to `SvnAccess` constructor. The default
        is "foom".
        
        * Throw `exc.ResourceChanged` exceptions when a file is found to be out of date
        during a write operation (which will only happen if `update_before_write` is
        unset by the caller) and revert local changes if this happens, to restore the
        checkout to an unconflicting state.
        
        
        0.2 (2009-07-25)
        ================
        
        * Now with doctests!
        
        * `SvnAccess.write` now supports an optional `update_after_write` argument.
        If set to a True value, calls to .write will end with an `svn up` to
        resynchronize the checkout with the repository. Default is False.
        
        * `SvnAccess.__init__` now supports an optional `update_after_write` argument.
        If set to a True value, all calls to .write will end with an `svn up`
        even if .write is not sent a True `update_after_write` value. Default
        is True, so if you are concerned with performance and willing to maintain
        synchronicity on your own, you should explicitly set this to False.
        
        * `SvnAccess.__init__` no longer executes a silent `os.chdir`.
        
        
        0.1.2 (2009-07-24)
        ==================
        
        First release.
