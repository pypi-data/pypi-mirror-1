=====================================
       membrane installation
=====================================

There are 2 ways to install membrane into your Zope instance.  The first is to
copy the "membrane" directory from the distribution's "Products" folder into
one of you Zope instance's "Products" folders.  The second is to use setuptools
to install membrane into your python environment.  In either case, you'll need
to restart Zope for the installation to take effect.

Once membrane is installed into Zope, you can use the portal_quickinstaller
to install the membrane product into your Plone site.
