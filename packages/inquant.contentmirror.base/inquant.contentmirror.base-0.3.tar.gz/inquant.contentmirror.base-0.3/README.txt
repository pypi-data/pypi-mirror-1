Abstract
--------

This package adds some basic views and adapters to allow Plone
content to be mirrored multiple times in a Plone site. This
mirroring is transparently and the mirrored content does not need
to know anything about it.

For more information, see the doctest in the inquant.contentmirror.base egg.
