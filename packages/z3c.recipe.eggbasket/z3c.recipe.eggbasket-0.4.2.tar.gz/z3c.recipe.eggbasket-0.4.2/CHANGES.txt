0.4.2 (2009-06-09)
==================

* Made the automated tests work when running bin/test.

* Fixed Windows problem: sometimes on Windows temporary dirs/files
  cannot be removed while installing. Now a warning is issued and the
  process continues. Fix contributed by Ben Dadsetan.
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/362833

* Fixed another annoyance with duplicate output lines.
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/321178

* When the download-cache has been set in buildout.cfg or in
  .buildout/default.cfg in the user's home directory, download the

  was not respected on Mac.

0.4.1 (2009-01-12)
==================

* Fixed temp dir removal error on Windows (fix makes the code saner
  for other systems too).  Fixes
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/315227

* Windows compatibility fix: use ``'wb'`` for writing to make downloading
  of the egg tarball succeeds on Windows.

0.4.0 (2008-09-22)
==================

* When the download fails, do not say "Continuing with buildout
  instead" as the downloader just exits then and it is up to the
  calling code or the user to continue the buildout if so wished.

* When installing the requirements from the tarball, we now look in
  the default index (python cheese shop usually) when the requirements
  can not be met by only the tarball.  This should not happen, but it
  does.  [maurits]

==================

* Got rid of annyoing "Unused options for basket: url" warning.

0.3.0 (2008-05-30)
==================

* Now also downloading extra Windows specific eggs when creating the
  tarball, as long as they are on the cheese shop.  [maurits]

0.2.0 (2008-05-22)
==================

* Created script around create_source_tarball function with the
  z3c.recipe.eggbasket:creator recipe.  Removed the releasemaker
  console script from setup.py for now as it was not handling command
  line arguments (yet).  [maurits]

* Added function create_source_tarball for creating the kind of source
  tarball that we are expecting.  The releasemaker console script
  calls this.  [maurits]

0.1.0 (2008-05-06)
==================

* Added tests.  [maurits]
