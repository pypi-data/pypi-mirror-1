Description: Change history
        **************
        
        .. Note: when releasing a new version of this package, also update the
        .. versions.cfg templates in grokproject as z3c.recipe.eggbasket is
        .. pinned there.
        
        
        0.4.2 (2009-06-09)
        ==================
        
        * Made the automated tests work when running bin/test.
        
        * Fixed Windows problem: sometimes on Windows temporary dirs/files
        cannot be removed while installing. Now a warning is issued and the
        process continues. Fix contributed by Ben Dadsetan.
        https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/362833
        
        * Fixed another annoyance with duplicate output lines.
        https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/321178
        
        * When the download-cache has been set in buildout.cfg or in
        .buildout/default.cfg in the user's home directory, download the
        tarball there and do not throw it away afterwards.
        
        * Fixed an issue with Windows interaction in the urllib module.
        https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/362833
        
        * Fixed minor doctest issue where the expected output order
        was not respected on Mac.
        
        0.4.1 (2009-01-12)
        ==================
        
        * Fixed temp dir removal error on Windows (fix makes the code saner
        for other systems too).  Fixes
        https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/315227
        
        * Windows compatibility fix: use ``'wb'`` for writing to make downloading
        of the egg tarball succeeds on Windows.
        
        0.4.0 (2008-09-22)
        ==================
        
        * When the download fails, do not say "Continuing with buildout
        instead" as the downloader just exits then and it is up to the
        calling code or the user to continue the buildout if so wished.
        [maurits]
        
        * When installing the requirements from the tarball, we now look in
        the default index (python cheese shop usually) when the requirements
        can not be met by only the tarball.  This should not happen, but it
        does.  [maurits]
        
        0.3.1 (2008-07-13)
        ==================
        
        * Got rid of annyoing "Unused options for basket: url" warning.
        
        0.3.0 (2008-05-30)
        ==================
        
        * Now also downloading extra Windows specific eggs when creating the
        tarball, as long as they are on the cheese shop.  [maurits]
        
        0.2.0 (2008-05-22)
        ==================
        
        * Created script around create_source_tarball function with the
        z3c.recipe.eggbasket:creator recipe.  Removed the releasemaker
        console script from setup.py for now as it was not handling command
        line arguments (yet).  [maurits]
        
        * Added function create_source_tarball for creating the kind of source
        tarball that we are expecting.  The releasemaker console script
        calls this.  [maurits]
        
        0.1.0 (2008-05-06)
        ==================
        
        * Added tests.  [maurits]
        
        * Initial implementation.  [maurits, timte]
        
        * Created recipe with ZopeSkel.  [Grok Team].

        Goal of this recipe
        ===================
        
        .. Note: the tests for this package may fail when you use the buildout
        .. generated bin/test command but pass when you run 'python setup.py
        .. test'.  Also, all tests pass for python 2.4 but there is a failure
        .. with python 2.5.  Fixing these differences would be appreciated.
        
        You have an egg (for example ``grok``) that has a lot of dependencies.
        Other eggs that it depends on are found on the cheeseshop, on
        sourceforge, and perhaps on some more servers.  When even one of these
        servers is down, other people (or you yourself) cannot install that
        egg.  Or perhaps your egg depends on a specific version of another egg
        and that version is removed from the cheeseshop for some bad reason.
        
        In other words: there are multiple points of failure.  Interested
        users want to try your egg, the install fails because a server is
        down, they are disappointed, leave and never come back.
        
        The goal of this recipe is to avoid having those multiple points of
        failure.  You create a tarball containing all eggs that your egg
        depends on.  A package like zc.sourcerelease_ can help here, but our
        recipe can also create such a tar ball.  Include it in a buildout like
        this::
        
        [buildout]
        parts = bundlemaker
        
        [bundlemaker]
        recipe = z3c.recipe.eggbasket:creator
        egg = grok
        versionfile = http://grok.zope.org/releaseinfo/grok-0.12.cfg
        
        After you have made that tar ball, you need to upload it somewhere.
        In your buildout you point this recipe to your egg and the url of the
        tarball, for example like this::
        
        [buildout]
        parts = eggbasket
        
        [eggbasket]
        recipe = z3c.recipe.eggbasket
        eggs = grok
        url = http://grok.zope.org/releaseinfo/grok-eggs-0.12.tgz
        
        The part using this recipe should usually be the first in line.  What
        the recipe then does is install your egg and all its dependencies
        using only the eggs found in that tarball.  After that you can let the
        rest of the buildout parts do their work.
        
        .. _zc.sourcerelease: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.sourcerelease
        
        
        Limitations
        ===========
        
        1. This approach still leaves you with multiple points of failure:
        
        - the cheeseshop must be up so the end user can install this recipe
        
        - the server with your tarball must be up.
        
        2. Before buildout calls the install method of this recipe to do the
        actual work, all buildout parts are initialized.  This means that
        all eggs and dependencies used by all recipes are installed.  This
        can already involve a lot of eggs and also multiple points of
        failure.  Workaround: you can first explicitly install the part
        that uses this recipe.  So with the buildout snippet from above
        that would be::
        
        bin/buildout install eggbasket
        
        
        Supported options
        =================
        
        The recipe supports the following options:
        
        eggs
        One or more eggs that you want to install with a tarball.
        
        url
        Url where we can get a tarball that contains the mentioned eggs
        and their dependencies.
        
        
        The releasemaker script supports the following options:
        
        egg
        The main egg that we want to bundle up with its dependencies.
        This is required.
        
        versionfile
        Config file that contains the wanted versions of the main egg and
        its dependencies.  An example is the grok version file:
        http://grok.zope.org/releaseinfo/grok-0.12.cfg
        This file is parsed by zc.buildout, so you can for example extend
        other files.  And the file can be a url or the name of a file in
        the current directory.
        
        
        Example usage
        =============
        
        We have a package ``orange`` that depends on the package ``colour``::
        
        >>> import os.path
        >>> import z3c.recipe.eggbasket.tests as testdir
        >>> orange = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(testdir.__file__), 'orange')
        >>> colour = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(testdir.__file__), 'colour')
        
        We create source distributions for them in a directory::
        
        >>> colours = tmpdir('colours')
        >>> sdist(colour, colours)
        >>> sdist(orange, colours)
        >>> ls(colours)
        -  colour-0.1.zip
        -  orange-0.1.zip
        
        We will define a buildout template that uses the recipe::
        
        >>> buildout_template = """
        ... [buildout]
        ... index = http://pypi.python.org/simple
        ... parts = basket
        ...
        ... [basket]
        ... recipe = z3c.recipe.eggbasket
        ... eggs = %(eggs)s
        ... url = %(url)s
        ... """
        
        We'll start by creating a buildout that does not specify an egg::
        
        >>> write('buildout.cfg', buildout_template % { 'eggs': '', 'url' : 'http://nowhere'})
        
        In this case the recipe will do nothing.  So the url does not get
        used.  Running the buildout gives us::
        
        >>> print 'start..\n', system(buildout)
        start..
        ...
        Installing basket.
        <BLANKLINE>
        
        Next we will specify an egg but refer to a bad url::
        
        >>> write('buildout.cfg', buildout_template % { 'eggs': 'orange', 'url' : 'http://nowhere'})
        >>> print system(buildout)
        Uninstalling basket.
        Installing basket.
        Couldn't find index page for 'orange' (maybe misspelled?)
        Getting distribution for 'orange'.
        eggbasket: Not all distributions are installed. A tarball will be downloaded.
        eggbasket: Downloading http://nowhere ...
        eggbasket: Url not found: http://nowhere.
        <BLANKLINE>
        
        So now we create a tar ball in a directory::
        
        >>> import tarfile
        >>> tarserver = tmpdir('tarserver')
        >>> cd(tarserver)
        >>> tarball = tarfile.open('colours.tgz', 'w:gz')
        >>> tarball.add(colours)
        
        Note: the order of the next listing is not guaranteed, so there might
        be a test failure here:
        
        >>> tarball.list(verbose=False)
        tmp/tmpDlQSIQbuildoutSetUp/_TEST_/colours/
        tmp/tmpDlQSIQbuildoutSetUp/_TEST_/colours/colour-0.1.zip
        tmp/tmpDlQSIQbuildoutSetUp/_TEST_/colours/orange-0.1.zip
        
        >>> tarball.close()
        >>> ls(tarserver)
        -  colours.tgz
        
        We make it available on a url and use it in our buildout::
        
        >>> cd(sample_buildout)
        >>> tarball_url = 'file://' + tarserver + '/colours.tgz'
        >>> write('buildout.cfg', buildout_template % { 'eggs': 'orange', 'url' : tarball_url})
        >>> print system(buildout)
        Uninstalling basket.
        Installing basket.
        Couldn't find index page for 'orange' (maybe misspelled?)
        Getting distribution for 'orange'.
        eggbasket: Not all distributions are installed. A tarball will be downloaded.
        eggbasket: Downloading /tarserver/colours.tgz ...
        eggbasket: Finished downloading.
        eggbasket: Extracting tarball contents...
        eggbasket: Installing eggs to /sample-buildout/eggs which will take a while...
        Getting distribution for 'orange'.
        Got orange 0.1.
        Getting distribution for 'colour'.
        Got colour 0.1.
