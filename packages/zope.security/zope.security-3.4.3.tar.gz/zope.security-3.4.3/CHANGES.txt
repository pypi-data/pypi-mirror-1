3.4.3 - (2009/11/26)
--------------------

- Backported a fix made by Gary Poster to the 3.4 branch:
  Fix for LP bug 181833 (from Gustavo Niemeyer). Before "visiting" a
  sub-object, a check should be made to ensure the object is still valid.
  Because garbage collection may involve loops, if you garbage collect an
  object, it is possible that the actions done on this object may modify the
  state of other objects. This may cause another round of garbage collection,
  eventually generating a segfault (see LP bug). The Py_VISIT macro does the
  necessary checks, so it is used instead of the previous code.


3.4.2 - (2009/03/23)
--------------------

- Added dependency 'zope.thread' to setup.py, without the tests were
  failing.

- Backported a fix made by Albertas Agejevas to the 3.4 branch. He
  fixed a bug in DecoratedSecurityCheckerDescriptor which made
  security-wrapping location proxied exception instances throw
  exceptions on Python 2.5.  See
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/251848


3.4.1 - 2008/07/27
------------------

- Made C code compatible with Python 2.5 on 64bit architectures.


3.4.0 - 2007/10/02
------------------

- Updated meta-data.


3.4.0b5 - 2007/08/15
--------------------

- Bug: Fixed a circular import in the C implementation.


3.4.0b4 - 2007/08/14
--------------------

- Bug: ``zope.security.management.system_user`` had an ugly/brittle id.


3.4.0b3 - 2007/08/14
--------------------

- ``zope.security`` now works on Python 2.5

- Bug: ``zope.security.management.system_user`` wasn't a valid principal
  (didn't provide IPrincipal).

- Bug: Fixed inclusion of doctest to use the doctest module from
  ``zope.testing``. Now tests can be run multiple times without
  breaking. (#98250)


3.4.0b2 - 2007/06/15
--------------------

- Bug: Removed stack extraction in newInteraction. When using eggs this is an
  extremly expensive function. The publisher is now more than 10 times faster
  when using eggs and about twice as fast with a zope trunk checkout.


3.4.0b1
-------

- Temporarily fixed the hidden (and accidental) dependency on zope.testing to
  become optional.

Note: The releases between 3.2.0 and 3.4.0b1 where not tracked as an
individual package and have been documented in the Zope 3 changelog.


3.2.0 - 2006/01/05
------------------

- Corresponds to the verison of the zope.security package shipped as part of
  the Zope 3.2.0 release.

- Removed deprecated helper functions, 'proxy.trustedRemoveSecurityProxy' and
  'proxy.getProxiedObject'.

- Made handling of 'management.{end,restore}Interaction' more careful w.r.t.
  edge cases.

- Made behavior of 'canWrite' consistent with 'canAccess':  if 'canAccess'
  does not raise 'ForbiddenAttribute', then neither will 'canWrite'.  See:
  http://www.zope.org/Collectors/Zope3-dev/506

- Code style / documentation / test fixes.


3.1.0 - 2005/10/03
------------------

- Added support for use of the new Python 2.4 datatypes, 'set' and
  'frozenset', within checked code.

- C security proxy acquired a dependency on the 'proxy.h' header from the
  'zope.proxy' package.

- XXX: the spelling of the '#include' is bizarre!  It seems to be related to
  'zpkg'-based builds, and should likely be revisited.  For the moment, I have
  linked in the 'zope.proxy' package into our own 'include' directory.  See
  the subversion checkin: http://svn.zope.org/Zope3/?rev=37882&view=rev

- Updated checker to avoid re-proxying objects which have and explicit
  '__Security_checker__' assigned.

- Corresponds to the verison of the zope.security package shipped as part of
  the Zope 3.1.0 release.

- Clarified contract of 'IChecker' to indicate that its 'check*' methods may
  raise only 'Forbidden' or 'Unauthorized' exceptions.

- Added interfaces, ('IPrincipal', 'IGroupAwarePrincipal', 'IGroup', and
  'IPermission') specifying contracts of components in the security framework.

- Code style / documentation / test fixes.


3.0.0 - 2004/11/07
------------------

- Corresponds to the version of the zope.security package shipped as part of
  the Zope X3.0.0 release.
