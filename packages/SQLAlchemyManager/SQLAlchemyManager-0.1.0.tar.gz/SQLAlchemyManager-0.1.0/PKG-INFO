        Get Started
        ===========
        
        * Download from the `SQLAlchemyManager Cheeseshop page <http://python.org/pypi/SQLAlchemyManager>`_
        * Install with ``easy_install SQLAlchemyManager``.
        
        Introduction
        =============
        
        SQLAlchemy has two problems:
        
        * It is very powerful and so can be used in many different ways but
        understanding the different options can be difficult.
        
        * To try to make SQLAlchemy simpler in Pylons, objects like scoped_session, g,
        MetaData etc are used, these further abstract the user from what is going on
        and make SQLAlchemy appear even more inpenetrable when you do try to get to
        grips with it
        
        This middleware sets up the *standard* SQLAlchemy objects in a piece of WSGI
        middleware without doing anything particularly clever and without using any
        global objects.
        
        As well as making things slightly simpler in frameworks such as Pylons, the
        setup recommended in this module also provides an API for other applications
        such as AuthKit (which can use their own SQLAlchemy objects) to be setup at the
        same time as the application's SQLAlchemy objects in the same model. This in
        turn begins to allow developers to componentise certain parts of their code
        even if they rely on a database.
        
        .. caution ::
        
        This package is currently *not* the recommended way of using SQLAlchemy in
        a WSGI environment and is merely the first step towards thinking about how
        best to do it.
        
        Tutorial
        ========
        
        Here's how SQLAlchemyManager is used in a Pylons application.
        
        In your ``config/middleware.py`` file at the top::
        
        from yourproject.model import setup_model
        from sqlalchemymanager import SQLAlchemyManager
        
        Then, right after the line where you set up
        ``PylonsApp``::
        
        app = SQLAlchemyManager(app, app_conf, [setup_model])
        
        Your ``model/__init__.py`` file then looks like this::
        
        from sqlalchemy import Column, Table, types
        from sqlalchemy.orm import mapper, relation
        
        def setup_model(model, metadata, **p):
        model.table1 = Table("table1", metadata,
        Column("id", types.Integer, primary_key=True),
        Column("name", types.String, nullable=False),
        )
        class MyClass(object):
        pass
        model.MyClass = MyClass
        model.table1_mapper = mapper(model.MyClass, model.table1)
        
        This means you can write code like this::
        
        from sqlalchemy.sql import select
        
        def app(environ, start_response):
        # The model is the same across requests so is safe to save as a global
        # somewhere in your application.
        model = environ['sqlalchemy.model']
        # You will get a new session object on each request so you shouldn't save it
        session = environ['sqlalchemy.session']
        
        # Use the SQLExpression API via the session object
        select_statement = select([model.table1])
        select_result = [row for row in session.execute(select_statement)]
        
        # Or use the ORM API
        mr_jones = model.MyClass()
        mr_jones.name = 'Mr Jones'
        session.save(mr_jones)
        session.commit()
        multiple_mr_jones = session.query(model.MyClass).filter(model.MyClass.name=='Mr Jones').all()
        
        # Return the data
        start_response('200 OK', [('Content-Type', 'text/plain')])
        return [
        '''
        Select Result:
        %s
        
        Mr Jones Results:
        %s
        '''%(
        select_result,
        ', '.join([person.name for person in multiple_mr_jones])
        )
        ]
        
        Notice that we are using both the ORM and SQL Expression features of SQLAlchemy
        and that options such as connection pooling will still work perfectly well.
        Also, existing SQLAlchemy setups shouldn't need much modification to work with
        this middleware. Simply wrapping their model definitions in a function and
        ensuring that all the SQLAlchemy objects are assigned to ``model`` explicitly
        should be enough.
        
        That's the basics. If you want to create the tables there are a number of ways:
        
        You can create the required tables during a request like this::
        
        # Create the tables
        environ['sqlalchemy.manager'].create_all()
        
        Or if you are using a script you can do this::
        
        from yourproject.model import setup_model
        from sqlalchemymanager import SQLAlchemyManager
        
        Then, right after the line where you set up
        ``PylonsApp``::
        
        manager = SQLAlchemyManager(None, app_conf, [setup_model])
        manager.create_all()
        
        To do any manipulation you'll need to create your own session::
        
        connection = manager.engine.connect()
        session = manager.session_maker(bind=connection)
        try:
        # Do stuff here
        pass
        finally:
        session.close()
        connection.close()
