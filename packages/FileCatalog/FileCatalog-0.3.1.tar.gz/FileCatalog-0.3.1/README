============

This package contains tools to create, view and transform hierachical
YAML_ representations (using PyYAML_) of directories and files below
a specified path:

- The **Indexer** is a command line application to traverse and index
  a directory structure and store the result as YAML.

- The **Viewer** is a graphical user interface that visualizes such a
  document as a tree.  It makes use of the wxPython_ toolkit.

- The **XHTMLizer** transforms tree data into XHTML representation.
