File Catalog change log
=======================

Version 0.3.1
-------------
(Jun 18, 2008)

- Fixed redundant newlines in XHTMLizer output.


Version 0.3
-----------
(May 16, 2008)

- Major code overhaul.

- Factored out YAML data access into new ``io`` module.  Replacing with/adding
  other formats, e.g. JSON or (theoretically) XML, is feasible.  This is
  especially interesting with regard to the likely intergration of a JSON
  package into the standard library in Python 2.6 as well as XML support
  already being available.

- Indexer:

  * A target file can no longer be specified.  Output is written to STDOUT
    only.  To save the result to a file, use your shell's redirection operator
    (``> output.yaml``).

- Visualizer:

  * Bigger toolbar buttons.

  * Added "Quit" button to toolbar.

  * File dialogs now accept both ``*.yml`` and ``*.yaml`` as file masks.

  * Files to load directly after application startup can be supplied as
    command-line arguments.

- XHTMLizer:

  * Renamed ``htmlizer`` to ``xhtmlizer``.

  * Made use of generators/``yield`` instead of appending to lists.

  * List items that contain lists themselves (and therefore resemble folders)
    gained an attribute ``class="folder"`` for easier formatting with CSS and
    behaviour programming with JavaScript.


Version 0.2
-----------
(Sep 19, 2007)

- Added ``htmlizer`` module for transforming trees into XHTML.


Version 0.1
-----------
(sometime in 2006/2007)

- Initial release.
