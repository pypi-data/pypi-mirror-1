Description: ============
        Motivation
        ============
        
        Twisted provides excellent support for creating delayed calls and looping calls,
        but when a daemon runs for extended periods of time, it is often necessary to
        schedule tasks to run in a manner that would be more easily described by a
        schedule instead of a number of seconds delay. The twistedschedule module
        provides an interface for describing a schedule and a single implementation, a
        subset of the cron schedules from linux/Unix. In order to use these schedules,
        a ScheduledCall class has been created that acts like the
        twisted.internet.task.LoopingCall class. In the future, an extension of the
        twisted.application.internet.TimerService may be provided that would use the
        ScheduledCall instead of LoopingCall to provide a similar service.

        The cron syntax used follows the crontab syntax listed on the Wikipedia page
        with the exceptions of the names of the days of the week which is not supported
        and the shortcuts which are also not supported.

        - twistedschedule.task.ScheduledCall completed
        - twistedschedule.cron.CronSchedule completed
        - unittests added for twistedschedule.task.ScheduledCall
        - unittests added for twistedschedule.cron

        Planning phase. A few different ideas were tested before deciding upon the
        current implementation.
