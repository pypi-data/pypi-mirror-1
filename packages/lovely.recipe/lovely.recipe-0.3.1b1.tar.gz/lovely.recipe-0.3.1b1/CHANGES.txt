BIG TODO: add tests for lovely.recipe.zeo and lovely.recipe.zope to test and
          to show for what this all is for.

- generated script names are created from the section name to allow more than
  just one extractor in one buildout.


2007/08/31 0.3.1a2:
===================

- merge from lovely-instance branch

- i18nextract allows the definition of a custem configure.zcml which is needed

  setup.
