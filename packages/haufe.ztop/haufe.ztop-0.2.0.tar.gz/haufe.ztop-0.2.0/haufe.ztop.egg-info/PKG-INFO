Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        ``haufe.ztop`` implements real-time Zope request analysis
        on top of haufe.requestmonitoring.
        
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        * Zope 2.12.0b2 or higher (or a Zope 2 trunk checkout)
        * haufe.requestmonitoring
        
        Features
        ========
        
        zanalyze
        --------
        
        Using ``zanalyze``:
        
        zanalyse [-i intervall] [-n numberLongRequests] [[-b] requestsBasename] [[-d] startDate]
        
        prints an 'sar' like requests summary from the Zope requests log file
        identified by *requestsBasename* and *startDate*.
        
        The '-i' option specifies the granularity in minutes. It defaults to "10".
        
        *requestsBasename* is either an instance tag (in which case it expands
        to '/var/log/zope/*requestsBasename*/zope_requests.') or
        the name of a zope requests file (not ending in '.') or of
        a zope requests file family (ending in '.').
        *requestsBasename* defaults to the instance tag 'Main'.
        *startDate* must have the format year, month and day, each with 2 digits
        e.g. '040803'. It defaults to the current date. Note that *requestsBasename*
        must be an instance tag or a family name, when you default *startDate*.
        
        
        ztop
        ----
        
        Using ``ztop``:
        
        ztop [-i interval] [-s shortPeriod] [-m medPeriod] [-l longPeriod] [-n numberLongRequests [-t time] [-r]] [[-b] requestsBasename] [[-d] startDate]
        
        displays request information by analysis of the Zope requests log file
        identified by *requestsBasename* and *startDate*.
        
        Information contains summaries for up to three periods: 'short', 'med'
        and 'long'. Their length is given by *shortPeriod* (default: 120),
        *medPeriod* (default: 600) and *longPeriod* (default: 3600) in seconds.
        Summaries contain load averaged over the period, number of finished
        requests, request rate, average, min, max and median request times (in ms)
        and the *numberLongRequests* (default: 3) longest requests in this period.
        A period length of "0" suppresses information about this period.
        
        The information is repeated every *interval* seconds.
        *interval* defaults to the value of *shortPeriod* or 120.
        A "0" value causes 'ztop' to stop after one display.
        
        The '-t' option tells 'ztop' to display information for *time*
        and then to stop. *time* is an ISO datetime or time value,
        e.g. '2004-08-03T12:00:00' or '12:00:00'.
        
        The '-r' option tells 'ztop' to display information for the last
        restart time and then to stop. '-r' is equivalent to '-t <restartTime>'.
        This is meant to facilitate the analysis of restarts.
        
        *requestsBasename* is either an instance tag (in which case it expands
        to '/var/log/zope/*requestsBasename*/zope_requests.') or
        the name of a zope requests file (not ending in '.') or of
        a zope requests file family (ending in '.').
        *requestsBasename* defaults to the instance tag 'Main'.
        *startDate* must have the format year, month and day, each with 2 digits
        e.g. '040803'. It defaults to the current date. Note that *requestsBasename*
        must be an instance tag or a family name, when you default *startDate*.
