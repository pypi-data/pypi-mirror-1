Python WebDAV client library, basically ripped from Zope 2.8.0.

* Implementation:
	
	Grabbed the WebDAV code from Zope, then httplib von Python 1.5.2 to
	make Zope happy. I still don't understand why Zope needs that 
	when it officially works w/ Python 2.3.5, but I couldn't get the
	dav module to work with a newer httplib. This version has no
	HTTPS support though, so there is hacked HTTPS class which I did
	w/ help from Python 2.4.x's HTTPSConnection.
