Description: This package was desgined to be a light-weight and easy-to-use static tree
        implementation. It allows the developer to quickly create trees with nodes
        that can be opened and closed without the use of JavaScript. The tree state
        can be retained over multiple sessions.

        What is ZopeTree?
        -----------------
        
        ZopeTree is a port of Philipp's Zope2 product ZopeTree. ZopeTree was
        meant to be a light-weight and easy-to-use static tree implementation,
        mainly designed for use in ZPTs. It was originally written because
        Zope2's `ZTUtils.Tree` was found to be too complicated and inflexible.
        
        The `ZTUtils` package has not been ported to Zope3. Parts of it, like
        batching, have found their way into Zope3, though. Only support for
        static tree generation is not in the core.
        
        
        How to use it
        -------------
        
        Using the skin
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ZopeTree comes with a pre-defined skin, StaticTree. It looks just
        like Zope3's default skin, Rotterdam, except that it displays a static
        tree in the navigation box instead of the Javascript/XML based dynamic
        tree.
        
        Using predefined views on objects
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ZopeTree comes with several predefined views:
        
        `cookie_tree`
        simple view using cookies for tree state storage.
        
        `folder_cookie_tree`
        same as above, however only showing folders.
        
        `site_cookie_tree`
        same as above, with the nearest site as root node.
        
        `root_cookie_tree`
        same as above, with the root container as root node.
        
        The example page template(s) in the browser package give an idea how
        to use these views for HTML templating.
        
        Customization
        -------------
        
        The best way to customize ZopeTree is to define your own view for
        objects (usually '*'). If you want to use the cookie functionality,
        simply extend the cookie browser view::
        
        from zope.app.tree.filters import OnlyInterfacesFilter
        from zope.app.tree.browser.cookie import CookieTreeView
        
        class BendableStaticTreeView(StaticTreeView):
        
        def bendablesTree(self):
        # tree with only IBendables, but also show the folder
        # they're in
        filter = OnlyInterfacesFilter(IBendable, IFolder)
        return self.cookieTree(filter)
        
        You can also write your own filters. All you have to do is implement
        the IObjectFindFilter interface (which is trivial)::
        
        from zope.interface import implements
        from zope.app.interfaces.find import IObjectFindFilter
        
        class BendableFilter:
        implements(IObjectFindFilter)
        
        def matches(self, obj)
        # only allow bendable objects
        return obj.isBendable()
