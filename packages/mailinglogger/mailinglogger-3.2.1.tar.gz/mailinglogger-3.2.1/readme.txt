Mailing Logger

  This provides more flexible and powerful email log handling for
  python's standard logging framework. 

  Two log handlers are provided:

  MailingLogger
  
    This mails out appropriate log entries as they are emitted.

    For more details see mailinglogger.txt in the docs directory of
    the distribution.

  SummarisingLogger

    This mails out a summary of all appropriate log entries at the end
    of the running python script.
  
    For more details see summarisinglogger.txt in the docs directory
    of the distribution.

  Both log handlers have the following features:
 
  - customisable and dynamic subject lines for emails sent

  - emails sent with a header as follows for easy filtering:

    X-Mailer: MailingLogger <version>

  - flood protection to ensure the number of emails sent is not
    excessive

  - support for SMTP servers that require authentication

  - configurable log entry filtering

  - fully documented and tested

  The only caveat for using this package is that the smtp server you
  are using must be fast. Email is sent via SMTP and, if using a
  MailingLogger, at the time the message is logged. If your SMTP
  server is slow, your application's performance may suffer.

  Installation

    To install, either:

    - Extract the .tar.gz anywhere on your python path.
    
    - use easy_install mailinglogger

    Additional support is provided if your application is based on one
    of the following frameworks:

    - ZConfig

      Please refer to zconfig.txt in the docs directory of the
      distribution. 

    - Zope 2

      Please refer to zope2.txt in the docs directory of the
      distribution. 
      
    - Zope 3

      Please refer to zope3.txt in the docs directory of the
      distribution. 
      
    Code that enables easier use of this package with other frameworks
    is welcome and will be included in a future release!
