1.1-alpha

Plone 3 compatibility fixes by Kees Hink <hink@gw20e.com>. This takes care of
just getting the product to work, but there's more that could be done: see the
TODO.

- Breaks compatibility with Plone 2.5, due to @@authenticator, which is called
  from the join_form in Plone 3, isn't available in Plone 2.5.

- Renamed permissions from "PortalInvite: ..." to "PloneInvite: ...".

- Minor modifications so it works under Plone 3, most notably
    - encode e-mail before sending

- Enabled self-registration ('Add portal member' permission on the site), which
  is needed to enable new members to register themselves. (Self-registration is
  protected by the validation on the join_form, so people will only be able to
  register with an invitation code.)

- Disabled 'info@yoursite.com' as default value, use site-wide
  email_from_address as default. (Still customizable through config.py)

- Disable overriding of mailhost settings. (Install.py used to reset the
  portal's mailhost settings to localhost:25)

- Turn on invitation generation for new users by default (5 invitations), this
  is probably what most sites want. Should be configurable in Plone product
  settings configlet.

- Disable bare try-except blocks in invite.cpy

- Translations:
  
  - Added PloneInvite.pot and plone.pot

  - Added Makefile for easy creation and updating of translation (.po) files

  - Added Dutch translation

- Fixed a bug in the user_invites template table, which showed only the invites
  which did not have enforce_address set.

- Fixed bug in Extensions/Install.py which added two 'invite_form' links to
  user actions.

- Added a "FakeMessageFactory" class for translations in controller scripts, 
  see fakemessagefactory.py
