For future release, these would be nice improvements:

- Allow modification of invitiations e-mail "Sender" in configlet (currently
  through ZMI).

- Modify configlet to enable modification of number of invites to give new
  users. (default is 5) 

- Include expiration functionality (invitation expires after configurable
  time period).

- Do not lose invitations when re-installing.
