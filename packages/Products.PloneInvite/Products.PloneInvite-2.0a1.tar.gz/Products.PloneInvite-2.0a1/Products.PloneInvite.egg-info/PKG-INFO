        Install

        Features
        ========
        
        1.  Assign invitations to the current site members.
        With these invitations, they can invite new members.
        New members will receive this invitation by e-mail.
        
        2.  The site manager can enforce email in the the invitation.
        This means the invitee must register with the email address to which the
        invitation was sent.
        
        3.  The inviting member can optionally also enforce email,
        if it was not already enforced by the site manager.
        
        4.  The "@@register" form now contains a field "invite_code".
        New users can register only if they have a valid invitation code.
        
        5.  The invitation e-mail message can be customized.
        (This can be done through the ZMI, it's a skin template.)
        
        6.  The portal administrator manage invitations through the configlet:
        
        - see which invitations have been accepted
        
        - revoke unused invitations
        
        - revoke sent but unaccepted invitations

        Changelog
        =========
        
        2.0a1 (2009-12-30)
        ------------------
        
        - Plone 4 compatible (Plone 3 support dropped)
        
        - Generic Setup installation
        
        - Updated README.txt's
        
        
        1.1-alpha (march 2009)
        ----------------------
        
        Plone 3 compatibility fixes [khink]. This takes care of
        just getting the product to work, but there's more that could be done: see the
        TODO.
        
        - Breaks compatibility with Plone 2.5, due to @@authenticator, which is called
        from the join_form in Plone 3, isn't available in Plone 2.5.
        
        - Renamed permissions from "PortalInvite: ..." to "PloneInvite: ...".
        
        - Minor modifications so it works under Plone 3, most notably
        - encode e-mail before sending
        
        - Enabled self-registration ('Add portal member' permission on the site), which
        is needed to enable new members to register themselves. (Self-registration is
        protected by the validation on the join_form, so people will only be able to
        register with an invitation code.)
        
        - Disabled 'info@yoursite.com' as default value, use site-wide
        email_from_address as default. (Still customizable through config.py)
        
        - Disable overriding of mailhost settings. (Install.py used to reset the
        portal's mailhost settings to localhost:25)
        
        - Turn on invitation generation for new users by default (5 invitations), this
        is probably what most sites want. Should be configurable in Plone product
        settings configlet.
        
        - Disable bare try-except blocks in invite.cpy
        
        - Translations:
        
        - Added PloneInvite.pot and plone.pot
        
        - Added Makefile for easy creation and updating of translation (.po) files
        
        - Added Dutch translation
        
        - Fixed a bug in the user_invites template table, which showed only the invites
        which did not have enforce_address set.
        
        - Fixed bug in Extensions/Install.py which added two 'invite_form' links to
        user actions.
        
        - Added a "FakeMessageFactory" class for translations in controller scripts,
        see fakemessagefactory.py
        
        
        TODO
        ====
        
        -   Complete i18n.
        
        -   Automaticaly add a number of invites for new members.
        (And modify the configlet to enable modification of number of
        invites to give new users.
        
        -   Re-add expiration functionality (invitation expires after configurable time
        period).
        
        -   Modify configlet to enable modification of invitiations e-mail "Sender" in
        Plone.
        
        -   In the configlet, don't show "Number of days the invitation stays active"
        if there are no members.
        
        -   Do not lose invitations when re-installing.
        
        -   See if we can subclass zope.interface.Interface instead of
        IDefaultPloneLayer (interfaces.IPloneInvitePolicy)
