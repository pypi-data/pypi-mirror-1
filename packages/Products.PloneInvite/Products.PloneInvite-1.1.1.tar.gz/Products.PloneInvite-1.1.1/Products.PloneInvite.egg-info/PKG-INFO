        =============
        
        
        Customizing the invite e-mail
        -----------------------------
        
        1. Go to the ZMI
        
        2. Go to portal_skins, to plone_invite, select the

        1. Go to the ZMI
        
        2. Go to the plone_invite tool, go to the 'properties' tab, modify

        CHANGES
        =======
        
        1.1.1 (2010-01-04)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed bug where invitation email's sender address was left empty
        - Add property 'plone_invite_sender_addres' to tool to use instead
        of site's 'email_from_addres'.
        
        
        1.1 (2009-12-01)
        ----------------
        
        Plone 3 compatibility fixes by Kees Hink <hink@gw20e.com>. This takes care of
        just getting the product to work, but there's more that could be done: see the
        TODO.
        
        - Breaks compatibility with Plone 2.5, due to @@authenticator, which is called
        from the join_form in Plone 3, isn't available in Plone 2.5.
        
        - Renamed permissions from "PortalInvite: ..." to "PloneInvite: ...".
        
        - Minor modifications so it works under Plone 3, most notably
        - encode e-mail before sending
        
        - Enabled self-registration ('Add portal member' permission on the site), which
        is needed to enable new members to register themselves. (Self-registration is
        protected by the validation on the join_form, so people will only be able to
        register with an invitation code.)
        
        - Disabled 'info@yoursite.com' as default value, use site-wide
        email_from_address as default. (Still customizable through config.py)
        
        - Disable overriding of mailhost settings. (Install.py used to reset the
        portal's mailhost settings to localhost:25)
        
        - Turn on invitation generation for new users by default (5 invitations), this
        is probably what most sites want. Should be configurable in Plone product
        settings configlet.
        
        - Disable bare try-except blocks in invite.cpy
        
        - Translations:
        
        - Added PloneInvite.pot and plone.pot
        
        - Added Makefile for easy creation and updating of translation (.po) files
        
        - Added Dutch translation
        
        - Fixed a bug in the user_invites template table, which showed only the invites
        which did not have enforce_address set.
        
        - Fixed bug in Extensions/Install.py which added two 'invite_form' links to
        user actions.
        
        - Added a "FakeMessageFactory" class for translations in controller scripts,
        see fakemessagefactory.py
        
        
        For future release, these would be nice improvements:
        
        - Allow modification of invitiations e-mail "Sender" in configlet (currently
        through ZMI).
        
        - Modify configlet to enable modification of number of invites to give new
        users. (default is 5)
        
        - Include expiration functionality (invitation expires after configurable
        time period).
        
        - Do not lose invitations when re-installing.
