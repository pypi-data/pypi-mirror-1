3.7.0 (2009-09-29)
------------------

- Clean up dependencies. Drop all testing dependencies as we only need
  zope.testing now.

- Fix ImportError when zope.testing is not available for some reason.

- Remove zcml slug and old zpkg-related files.

- Remove word "version" from changelog entries.

- Change package's mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org as
  zope3-dev at zope.org is now retired. Also change `cheeseshop` to
  `pypi` in the package's homepage url.

- Add dependency on ZODB3 as we use Persistent.

- Use a mock request for testing. Dropped the dependency on zope.publisher
  which was really only a testing dependency.

  longer using the Contained mix-in class.
