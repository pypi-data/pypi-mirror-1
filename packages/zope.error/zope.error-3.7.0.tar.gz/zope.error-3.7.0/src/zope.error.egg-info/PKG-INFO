        CHANGES
        =======
        
        3.7.0 (2009-09-29)
        ------------------
        
        - Clean up dependencies. Drop all testing dependencies as we only need
        zope.testing now.
        
        - Fix ImportError when zope.testing is not available for some reason.
        
        - Remove zcml slug and old zpkg-related files.
        
        - Remove word "version" from changelog entries.
        
        - Change package's mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org as
        zope3-dev at zope.org is now retired. Also change `cheeseshop` to
        `pypi` in the package's homepage url.
        
        - Add dependency on ZODB3 as we use Persistent.
        
        - Use a mock request for testing. Dropped the dependency on zope.publisher
        which was really only a testing dependency.
        
        - Reduced the dependency on zope.container to one on zope.location by no
        longer using the Contained mix-in class.
        
        3.6.0 (2009-01-31)
        ------------------
        
        - Use zope.container instead of zope.app.container
        
        - Move error log bootstrapping logic (which was untested) to
        ``zope.app.appsetup``, to which we added a test.
        
        3.5.1 (2007-09-27)
        ------------------
        
        - rebumped to replace faulty egg
        
        3.5.0
        -----
        
        - Initial documented release
        
        - Moved core components from ``zope.app.error`` to this package.
