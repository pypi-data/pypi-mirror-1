Description: ========================
        Form UI for ``z3c.form``
        ========================
        
        This package provides a set of default layouts for the ``z3c.form``
        framework. In particular it provides a DIV-based and a TABLE-based layout. The
        developer can use either layout by inheriting from a different base layer.
        
        The package also has some support for layout/pagelet tempaltes.

        CHANGES
        =======
        
        Version 1.2.0 (7/18/2007)
        -------------------------
        
        - Feature: The row div element now also has an id of the form
        "<widget-id>-row".
        
        
        Version 1.1.1 (7/4/2007)
        -------------------------
        
        - Refactoring: Split up registrations for simpler management of UI
        components. This also makes it easier to see for developers how to create a
        new template for forms.
        
        
        Version 1.1.0 (6/29/2007)
        -------------------------
        
        - Feature: Registered all defined macros for each form template. Also, added
        more slots to the templates providing more hooks for customization.
        
        - Feature: Added a macro/slot for the "required info", which explains how
        required fields are marked.
        
        - Feature: Added support for form labels.
        
        - Feature: Added support for groups to templates.
        
        
        Version 1.0.1 (6/22/2007)
        -------------------------
        
        - Bug: Make sure we use the id for the "for" attribute of the "label"
        element and not the name. This has worked until recently, because the
        name and id were the same, but they are different now.
        
        
        Version 1.0.0 (5/24/2007)
        -------------------------
        
        - Initial Release
