====================
Form User Interfaces
====================

This package provides several useful templates to get a quick start with the
``z3c.form`` package. Previous form frameworks always included default
templates that were implemented in a particular user-interface development
pattern. If you wanted to use an alternative strategy to develop user
interfaces, it was often tedious to do so. This package aims to provide some
options without requireing them for the basic framework.


Layout Template Support

One common pattern in Zope 3 user interface development is the use of layout
templates. This package provides some mixin classes to the regular form
classes to support layout-based templating.


DIV-based Forms
