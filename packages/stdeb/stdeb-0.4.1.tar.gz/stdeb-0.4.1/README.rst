stdeb - Python to Debian source package conversion utility
==========================================================

stdeb_ ("setuptools debian") produces Debian source packages from
Python packages via a new distutils command, ``sdist_dsc``. Automatic
defaults are provided for the Debian package, but many aspects of the
resulting package can be customized via a configuration file.

Invocation
----------

All methods eventually result in a call to the ``sdist_dsc`` distutils
command. You may prefer to do so directly::

  python -c "import stdeb; execfile('setup.py')" sdist_dsc

Alternatively, two scripts are provided::

  stdeb_run_setup [options] # calls "python setup.py sdist_dsc [options]"

  py2dsc [options] mypackage-0.1.tar.gz # uses pre-built Python source package

In all cases, a Debian source package is produced from unmodified
Python packages. The following files are produced in a newly created
subdirectory ``deb_dist``:

 * ``packagename_versionname.orig.tar.gz``
 * ``packagename_versionname-debianversion.dsc``
 * ``packagename_versionname-debianversion.diff.gz``

These can then be compiled into binary packages using the standard
Debian machinery (e.g. dpkg-buildpackage).

Also, a ``bdist_deb`` distutils command is installed. This calls the
sdist_dsc command and then runs dpkg-buildpackage on the result::

  python -c "import stdeb; execfile('setup.py')" bdist_deb

Examples
--------

Quickstart 1: Just tell me the fastest way to make a .deb
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Do this from the directory with your `setup.py` file::

  python -c "import stdeb; execfile('setup.py')" bdist_deb

This will make a Debian source package (.dsc, .orig.tar.gz and
.diff.gz files) and then compile it to a Debian binary package (.deb)
for your current system. The result will be in ``deb_dist``.

**Warning: installing the .deb file on other versions of Ubuntu or
Debian than the one on which it was compiled will result in undefined
behavior. If you have extension modules, they will probably
break. Even in the absence of extension modules, bad stuff will likely
happen.**

For this reason, it is much better to build the Debian source package
and then compile that (e.g. using `Ubuntu's PPA`__) for each target
version of Debian or Ubuntu.

__ https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA

Quickstart 2: I read the warning, so show me how to make a source package, then compile it
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

This generates a source package::

  wget http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/R/Reindent/Reindent-0.1.0.tar.gz
  py2dsc Reindent-0.1.0.tar.gz

This turns it into a .deb using the standard Debian tools. (Do *this*
on the same source package for each target distribution)::

  cd deb_dist/reindent-0.1.0/
  dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc -us

This installs it::

  cd ..
  sudo dpkg -i python-reindent_0.1.0-1_all.deb

Another example, with more explanation
``````````````````````````````````````

This example is more useful if you don't have a Python source package
(.tar.gz file generated by ``python setup.py sdist``). For the sake of
illustration, we do download such a tarball, but immediately unpack it
(alternatively, use a version control system to grab the unpacked
source of a package)::

  wget http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/R/Reindent/Reindent-0.1.0.tar.gz
  tar xzf Reindent-0.1.0.tar.gz
  cd Reindent-0.1.0

The following will generate a directory ``deb_dist`` containing the
files ``reindent_0.1.0-1.dsc``, ``reindent_0.1.0.orig.tar.gz`` and
``reindent_0.1.0-1.diff.gz``, which, together, are a debian source
package::

  python setup.py sdist_dsc

(For packages that don't use setuptools, you need to get the stdeb
monkeypatch for the sdist_dsc distutils command. So, do this: ``python
-c "import stdeb; execfile('setup.py')" sdist_dsc``, or use the
command ``stdeb_run_setup``, which does just this.)

The source generated in the above way is also extracted (using
``dpkg-source -x``) and placed in the ``deb_dist`` subdirectory. To
continue the example above::

  cd deb_dist/reindent-0.1.0
  dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc -us

Finally, the generated package can be installed::

  cd ..
  sudo dpkg -i python-reindent_0.1.0-1_all.deb

For yet another example of use, with still more explanation, see
`allmydata-tahoe ticket 251`_.

Background
----------

For the average Python package, its source distribution
(python_package.tar.gz created with ``python setup.py sdist``)
contains nearly everything necessary to make a Debian source
package. This near-equivalence encouraged me to write this distutils
extension, which executes the setup.py file to extract relevant
information. This process is made significantly easier through the use
of setuptools_.

.. _setuptools: http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools

setuptools is used because of some nice features.  For example,
setuptools makes the job of "Debianizing" python console and gui
scripts much easier.

I wrote this initially to Debianize several Python packages of my own,
but I have the feeling it could be generally useful. It appears
similar, at least in theory, to easydeb_, `Logilab's Devtools`_,
bdist_dpkg_ and bdist_deb_.

Features
--------

* Create a package for all Python versions supported by
  python-support. (Limiting this range is possible with the
  ``XS-Python-Version:`` config option.)

* Automatic conversion of Python package names into valid Debian
  package names.

* Attempt to automatically convert version numbers such that ordering
  is maintained. (The setuptools version sorting is different than the
  Debian version sorting.) See also the config option
  ``Forced-Upstream-Version``.

* Fine grained control of version numbers. (``Debian-Version``,
  ``Forced-Upstream-Version``, ``Upstream-Version-Prefix``,
  ``Upstream-Version-Suffix`` config options.)

* Install .desktop files. (``MIME-Desktop-Files`` config option.)

* Install .mime and .sharedmimeinfo files. (``MIME-File`` and
  ``Shared-MIME-File`` config options.)

* Install copyright files. (``Copyright-File`` config option.)

* Apply patches to upstream sources. (``Stdeb-Patch-File`` config
  option.)

* Pass environment variables to setup.py script. (``Setup-Env-Vars``
  config option.)

Customizing the produced Debian source package (config options)
---------------------------------------------------------------

stdeb will attempt to provide reasonable defaults, but these are only
guesses.

To customize the Debian source package produced, you may write config
files of the format understood by ConfigParser_. When building each
package, stdeb looks for the existance of a ``stdeb.cfg`` file in the
``.egg-info`` directory. You may specify an additional config file
with the command-line option --extra-cfg-file. Other command line
options may also be provided.

Prerequisites
-------------

 * Python_ 2.5 or higher (older python OK if you use subprocess.py
   with backports from Python 2.5)
 * Standard Debian utilities such as ``date``, ``dpkg-source`` and
   Debhelper 7 (use stdeb 0.3.x if you need to support older
   distributions without dh7)

.. _Python: http://www.python.org/

Using stdeb on stdeb
--------------------

There is a chicken-and-egg problem when trying to make a Debian
package of stdeb with stdeb. Here's a recipe to avoid it::

 # in the stdeb distribution directory (with setup.py)
 python setup.py sdist
 python setup.py build
 PYTHONPATH="build/lib" python stdeb/py2dsc.py dist/stdeb-VERSION.tar.gz

TODO
----

* Make output meet `Debian Python Policy`_ specifications or the `new
  python policy`_. This will include several things, among which are:

  - the ability to make custom changelogs
  - the ability to include project-supplied documentation as a -doc package
  - include license information in debian/copyright
  - the ability to include project-supplied examples, tests, and data
    as a separate package
  - much more not listed

* Create (better) documentation

* Log output using standard distutils mechanisms

* Refactor the source code to have a simpler, more sane design

Call for volunteers
-------------------

I don't have a lot of time for this. This project stands a very real
chance of being only a shadow of its potential self unless people step
up and contribute. There are numerous ways in which people could
help. In particular, I'd be interested in finding a co-maintainer or
maintainer if the project generates any interest. Secondarily, I would
appreciate advice from Debian developers or Ubuntu MOTUs about the
arcane details of Python packaging.
