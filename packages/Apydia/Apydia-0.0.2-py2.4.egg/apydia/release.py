Apydia
======

Apydia is an API reference documentation generator for Python. It's
designed as an instantly serviceable replacement for Pudge's API-documentation
generator. It won't generate complete websites from reST etc. like
Pudge does, though - Apydia is only about the API.

Features
--------

 - Basic pudge compatibility and a short and easy migration path
 - Rudimentary Trac-integration, that is links into Trac's sourcecode browser
 - Some fair amount of usability
 - Setuptools integration
 - Flexible, Genshi/XInclude-based themeability with theme inheritance
 - Support for various text formats like Markdown, Textile and reST
 - Other parsers can easily be plugged in on demand
 - Syntax highlighting thanks to Pygments
