Change Log for SetupHelper Version 0.2

:Author:        Peter A. Donis

Version 0.2
-----------

- Added ``__dev_status__`` variable for the
  development status; it automatically adds
  the appropriate classifier.

- The __requires__ variable is only processed
  if the setup command is ``build``, ``clean``,
  or ``install``. If the command is ``clean``,
  the only requirement processing is to run
  the clean command for requirements that are
  already downloaded and unpacked.

- Added support for ``__package_dir__``, the
  standard distutils keyword specifying a
  mapping of package names to subdirectories
  of the setup directory; if the empty string
  '' is a key, its value specifies the 'root'
  of the source tree for both standalone
  modules and packages.

- Changed the meaning of ``__package_root__``
  and ``__package_dirs__``; ``__package_root__`` now
  specifies the root of the source tree,
  equivalent to package_dir[''], and
  ``__package_dirs__`` now specifies subdirs of
  ``__package_root__`` that contain packages
  (if the default auto-detection is not good
  enough).

- Added ``__post_install__`` variable to allow
  running of post-install scripts.

Version 0.1
