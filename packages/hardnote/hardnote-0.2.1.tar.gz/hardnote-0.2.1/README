HardNote (pre-release)

A hardware notification tool. On a freedesktop.org compatible DE, it will
notify the session user of new hardware plugged in.

THIS IS VERY MUCH AN ALPHA, BEWARE.

Future Goals:

  * Add appropriate notification hinting. (category)
  * Add sexy icon(s) to notifications.
  * Clicking on notification performs context appropriate action.
