Description: What is WinAppDbg?
        ==================
        
        The WinAppDbg python module allows developers to quickly code instrumentation
        scripts in Python under a Windows environment.
        
        It uses ctypes to wrap many Win32 API calls related to debugging, and provides
        an object-oriented abstraction layer to manipulate threads, libraries and
        processes, attach your script as a debugger, trace execution, hook API calls,
        handle events in your debugee and set breakpoints of different kinds (code,
        hardware and memory). Additionally it has no native code at all, making it
        easier to maintain or modify than other debuggers on Windows.
        
        The intended audience are QA engineers and software security auditors wishing to
        test / fuzz Windows applications with quickly coded Python scripts. Several
        ready to use utilities are shipped and can be used for this purposes.
        
        Current features also include disassembling x86 native code (using the open
        source diStorm project, see http://ragestorm.net/distorm/), debugging multiple
        processes simultaneously and produce a detailed log of application crashes,
        useful for fuzzing and automated testing.
