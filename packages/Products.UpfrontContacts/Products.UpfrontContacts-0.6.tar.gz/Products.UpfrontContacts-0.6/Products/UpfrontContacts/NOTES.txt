0.3.0
-----

This is the first public release of UpfrontContacts. 

Of note in this release:

- Person instances can now have portal users associated with them. Added
  view where login details can be specified, a user's password can be
  reset and the user associated with a person can be removed.

  This basically makes the user configuration in the Plone control panel
  available on a person instance.

- Contacts can now be imported and exported as CSV. We re-used most of
  the import and export code from mxmContacts. Thanks Max!

One of the required products is ATSchemaEditor 0.3.2. There are some
bugs in this version that prevents it from working with Plone 2.1 and
above. A patched version is available for download here:

The patched version installs properly as a tool available in the Plone
control panel, does not raise an exception when a widget is not
registered with ATSE and allows editing of import ReferenceField
attributes like "multivalued", "vocabular_display_path",
"checkbox_bound"
