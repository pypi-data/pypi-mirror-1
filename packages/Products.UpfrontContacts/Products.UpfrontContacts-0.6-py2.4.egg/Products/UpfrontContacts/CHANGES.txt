- Remove AddressFields from Schema Editor control

  a string.

  handle simple types

- New ContactManager class with a UI derived from BaseCamp's contact
  management UI.

0.3.0
-----

- Added nice icons grabbed from Mark James' Silk icon set 1.2
  (http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/)

- Person instances can now have portal users associated with them. Added
  view where login details can be specified, a user's password can be
  reset and the user associated with a person can be removed.

  This basically makes the user configuration in the Plone control panel
  available on a person instance.

- Contacts can now be imported and exported as CSV. We could re-use most
  of the import and export code from mxmContacts. Thanks Max!
