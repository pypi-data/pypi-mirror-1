Description: Manage organisations, people and the relationships between them inside
        Plone and allow them to log in easily to your Plone site.
        
        This product provides the content types Person and Organisation. Person
        and Organisation instances can be created anywhere in a Plone site. Both
        content types are folderish to allow the storage of related content
        inside them. AT References are used to represent the relationships
        between organisations and people.
        
        Person instances can log into a Plone site. This is made possible by
        subclassing remember FolderishMember.
        
        A nice contact manager UI derived from BaseCamp's people management is
        available when adding a Contact Manager to your Plone site.
        
        More features:
        
        Import and export contacts in CSV format.
        
        Import and export contacts in vCard format.
        
        Contacts has remember support and can log in to a Plone site.
