3.5.1 (2009-01-31)
==================

- Adapt tests to upcoming zope.schema release 3.5.1.

3.5.0 (2009-01-26)
==================

New Features
------------

- Test dependencies are declared in a `test` extra now.

- Introduced ``zope.formlib.form.applyData`` which works like
  ``applyChanges`` but returns a dictionary with information about
  which attribute of which schema changed.  This information is then
  sent along with the ``IObjectModifiedEvent``.

  This fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/98483.

Bugs Fixed
----------

- Actions that cause a redirect (301, 302) do not cause the `render` method to
  be called anymore.

- The zope.formlib.form.Action class didn't fully implement
  zope.formlib.interfaces.IAction.

- zope.formlib.form.setupWidgets and zope.formlib.form.setupEditWidgets did
  not check for write access on the adapter but on context. This fixes
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/219948


3.4.0 (2007-09-28)
==================
