Planned Features
================

- Authenticated view that ties in with Django's `auth <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth>`_ system
- Testing an RPC method directly from the documentation (like `XMLRPC for PHP <http://phpxmlrpc.sf.net/>`_)
- Fix some failing unit tests on older python versions
