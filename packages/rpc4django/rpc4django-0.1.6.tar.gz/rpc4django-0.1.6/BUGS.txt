Known Issues
============

- There is a known issue that relates to but is not the same as `Django Bug #6681 <http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/6681>`_.
  This bug sometimes raises an ``AttributeError: Values instance has no attribute 'default_reference_context'`` error when converting text to reST.
  The bug is very difficult to reproduce and the workaround specified in the Django bug is not relevant to RPC4Django since it does not change the default docutils role.
  A workaround is provided such that the exception is caught and the ``rpc4django.templatetags.rpctags.resttext`` function will return the plain text if ``publish_parts`` fails for any reason.
  This error is logged as fatal by RPC4Django's logger.
