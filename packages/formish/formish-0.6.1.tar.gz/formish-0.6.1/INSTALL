This will also bring in all of the requirements.

  
Testing
-------

You can run the standard unittests by running

nosetests formish/tests/unittests

in the formish home directory

We have a larger range of tests for widgets, validation and conversion in formish/tests/testish which can be run as

nosetests testish/lib/test_functests
nosetests testish/lib/test_unittests

or just 

notsetests if you want to test everything.. 

The functional tests require restish, imagemagick, selenium, webob
