Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        An interactive ipython shell to be used in your doctest, very similar to and
        based on interlude.
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        >>> from chaoflow.testing.ipython import ipshell, dtipshell
        
        By default you will get the default fancy ipython prompt:
        
        >>> ipshell( locals())
        
        In order to get a prompt suitable for doctest generation, pass doctest=True:
        
        >>> ipshell( locals(), doctest=True)
        
        or use dtipshell, which does exactly that:
        
        >>> dtipshell( locals())
