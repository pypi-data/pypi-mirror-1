        Introduction
        ------------
        
        `collective.indexing`_ is an approach to provide an abstract framework for
        queuing and optimizing index operations in `Plone`_ as well as dispatching
        them to various backends.  The default implementation aims to replace the
        standard indexing mechanism of `CMF`_ to allow index operations to be handled
        asynchronously in a backwards-compatible way.
        
        Queuing these operations on a transaction level allows to get rid of redundant
        indexing of objects and thereby providing a substantial performance
        improvement.  By leveraging the component architecture and event system of
        `zope3` `collective.indexing`_ also makes it much easier to use backends other
        than or in addition to the standard portal catalog for indexing, such as
        dedicated search engine solutions like `Solr`_, `Xapian`_ or `Google Search
        Appliance`_.  One backend implementation designed to be used with this package
        has already been started in the form of `collective.solr`_.

        Current Status
        --------------
        
        The implementation is considered to be nearly finished.  The package can be
        installed in a Plone 3.x site to enable indexing operations to be queued,
        optimized and dispatched to the standard portal catalog on the zope
        transaction boundary thereby improving the Plone's out-of-the-box
        performance_.  A buildout_ is provided for your convenience.

        .. _buildout: http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/collective.indexing/buildout
        
        At the moment the package requires "monkey patches" to the mixin classes
        currently used to hook up indexing, i.e. ``CMFCatalogAware`` (from `CMF`_)
        and ``CatalogMultiplex`` (from `Archetypes`_).  It is planned to make these
        classes "pluggable" by use of adapters, allowing `collective.indexing` to
        hook in in clean ways.  This will be proposed as a `PLIP`_ for inclusion
        into `Plone`_ 3.2.
        
        .. _`Archetypes`: http://plone.org/products/archetypes
        .. _`PLIP`: http://plone.org/documentation/glossary/plip
        
        In conjunction with `collective.solr`_ the package also provides a
        working solution for integration of `Solr`_ with `Plone`_.  Based on a schema
        `configurable`__ at `zc.buildout`_ level indexing operations can be dispatched
        a `Solr`_ instance in addition or alternatively to the standard catalog.  This
        allows for minimal and very efficient indexing of standard `Plone`_ content
        items based on `Archetypes`_.  Providing support for other content types is
        rather trivial and will be support soon.

        .. _`zc.buildout`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout
        
        The code was written with emphasis on minimalism, clarity and maintainability.
        It comes with extensive tests covering the code base at more than 95%.
        
        For outstanding issues and features remaining to be implemented please see the
        `to-do list`__ included in the package.

        Systems`_ as well as `work done at the snowsprint'08`__.  The
        ``TransactionManager`` pattern is taken from `enfold.solr`_.  Development was
