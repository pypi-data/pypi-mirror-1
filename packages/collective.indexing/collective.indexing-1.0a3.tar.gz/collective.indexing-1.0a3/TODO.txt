To-Do's
=======

Issues
------

- make sure indexing works when catalog gets updated via the zmi

.. - at the moment there are no known issues or bugs

Features
--------

- monkey patch for adapterization of ``CMFCore.CMFCatalogAware`` and
  ``Archetypes.CatalogMultiplex`` in order to make the to be used indexing
  backend easily pluggable, so that queueing and/or dispatching becomes
  entirely configurable via zcml

Miscellaneous
-------------

- creation of a PLIP targeted at Plone 3.2 regarding the above mentioned
  adapterization of ``CMFCore.CMFCatalogAware`` and
  ``Archetypes.CatalogMultiplex``;  the default configuration would then
  be to hook up the catalog processor directly, i.e. without queueing etc

- integrate more of the tests regarding transactions and threading from
  enfold.solr
