Description: Overview
        ========
        
        The motivation for this package is to encourage the use of request
        type adaptation instead of depending on packages with request type
        definitions.
        
        Instead of subclassing the request interface, we encourage an
        adaptation pattern:
        
        >>> from repoze.bfg.interfaces import IRequest
        >>> IGZipRequest = IRequest({'http_accept_encoding': 'gzip'})
        
        An event handler listens for the ``INewRequest`` event and
        automatically marks the request with interfaces as needed to adapt the
        request to the request types that it may apply for.
        
        To complete the example above, a request would come in with an HTTP
        environment like the following:
        
        {'http_accept_encoding': 'compress, gzip'}
        
        Since we've previouly adapted the request to an accept-encoding of
        'gzip', the adaptation machinery will mark the interface such that
        this environment will match the ``IGZipRequest`` interface.
        
        This would be an alternative to subclassing, where we would manually
        have to set up an event listener that interprets the request
        environment and marks the request with the interface.
        
        >>> class IGZipRequest(IRequest):
        ...     """Marker interface for requests for gzipped response."""

        Adaptable HTTP request interfaces
        =================================
        
        Suppose we want to adapt on requests that have an "http_accept_encoding"
        that calls for a gzipped response, we'd set up an interface as
        follows:
        
        >>> from repoze.bfg.interfaces import IRequest
        >>> IGZipRequest = IRequest({'http_accept_encoding': 'gzip'})
        
        Let's now craft a request that will match this interface.
        
        >>> class TestRequest(object):
        ...     interface.implements(IRequest)
        ...
        ...     def __init__(self, environ):
        ...         self.environ = environ
        
        >>> request = TestRequest({'http_accept_encoding': 'compress, gzip'})
        
        At this point, the request has not been prepared for adaptation.
        
        >>> from repoze.bfg.events import NewRequest
        >>> from zope.event import notify
        >>> notify(NewRequest(request))
        
        We expect the request to implement the ``IGZipRequest`` interface.
        
        >>> IGZipRequest.providedBy(request)
        True
        
        To get more flexibility, we can supply a match function:
        
        >>> IAlternativeGZipRequest = IRequest(
        ...    {'http_accept_encoding': lambda value: 'gzip' in value})
        
        >>> notify(NewRequest(request))
        >>> IAlternativeGZipRequest.providedBy(request)
        True
        
        Suppose now we'd also like to support requests for documents in
        German.
        
        >>> IGermanLanguageRequest = IRequest({'http_accept_language': 'de'})
        
        We'll create a new request, which, besides asking a gzipped response,
        also asks for the content in German.
        
        >>> request = TestRequest(
        ...     {'http_accept_encoding': 'compress, gzip', 'http_accept_language': 'de'})
        
        >>> notify(NewRequest(request))
        
        Verify that the request provides the adapted interfaces.
        
        >>> IGermanLanguageRequest.providedBy(request)
        True
        
        >>> IGZipRequest.providedBy(request)
        True
        
        Now, as you would expect, we can adapt a request interface that
        combines these two environments.
        
        >>> IZippedGerman = IRequest(
        ...    {'http_accept_encoding': 'gzip', 'http_accept_language': 'de'})
        >>> notify(NewRequest(request))
        
        >>> IZippedGerman.providedBy(request)
        True
        
        Note that this interface extends the two interfaces that were created
        for each of the environment pairs of it.
        
        >>> IZippedGerman.isOrExtends(IGermanLanguageRequest)
        True
        
        >>> IZippedGerman.isOrExtends(IGZipRequest)
        True
        
        Let's try a request that doesn't match.
        
        >>> IZippedFrench = IRequest(
        ...     {'http_accept_encoding': 'gzip', 'http_accept_language': 'fr'})
        >>> notify(NewRequest(request))
        
        >>> IZippedFrench.providedBy(request)
        False
        
        Adapted requests are global with respect to the environment:
        
        >>> IRequest({'http_accept_encoding': 'gzip'}) is IRequest({'http_accept_encoding': 'gzip'})
        True
        
        Pickle-support
        --------------
        
        The adapted interface are created dynamically and would therefore not
        be locatable by the ``pickle`` module. To remedy this, an import hook
        is added on package initialization.
        
        (The ``repoze.bfg`` packages pickles configuration actions in order to
        improve startup time, and therefore it's important that the adapted
        interfaces are pickable.)
        
        >>> from pickle import dumps, loads
        >>> p = dumps(IGZipRequest)
        
        Now, we'll pretend that we the ``repoze.bfg.httprequest.interfaces`` has
        not yet been imported. This will make pickle import it when we load
        back the pickle.
        
        >>> import sys
        >>> del sys.modules['repozehttprequestinterfaces']
        
        We'll reinitialize the interfaces module.
        
        >>> loads(p)
        <IHTTPRequest http_accept_encoding=gzip>
