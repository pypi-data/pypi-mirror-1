======================================
Changes in 0.6.3 (released 06/21/2005)
======================================

  * Rewrote string output: Each string fragment will now be shipped
    with a separate call to the write procedure. This fixes several
    bugs with long strings.


======================================
Changes in 0.6.2 (released 06/10/2005)
======================================

  * If the return value of the generated function is NCLOB or
    NVARCHAR2, all generated string constants will have an N prefix
    now.


======================================
Changes in 0.6.1 (released 03/22/2005)
======================================

  * Added a note about the package init file to the installation
    documentation.


====================================
Changes in 0.6 (released 01/03/2005)
====================================

  * toxic now requires the core module and Python 2.4.


======================================
Changes in 0.5.1 (released 11/23/2004)
======================================

  * The local clob writing procedures are now defined after the local
    variables.


====================================
Changes in 0.5 (released 11/11/2004)
====================================

  * When the return type is a CLOB, then writing to the CLOB is done
    via local procedures in the generated function, that use the
    DBMS_LOB package for writing to the CLOB. This speeds up the
    functions tremendously (a factor of 100 is possible).


====================================
Changes in 0.4 (released 10/27/2004)
====================================

  * It's now possible to specify the return type of the generated
    function (via the processing instruction type).
  * ll.toxic is compatible to XIST 2.6 now.


====================================
Changes in 0.3 (released 07/06/2004)
====================================

  * A new function prettify is included that tries to fix the
    indentation of a PL/SQL snippet.
  * OraclePublisher has been renamed to Publisher.


====================================
Changes in 0.2 (released 07/01/2004)
====================================

  * A bug in tokenize that surfaced when the PI didn't have data, has
    been fixed.
  * OraclePublisher now no longer creates the function directly.
    Instead it's just a normal publisher that transforms the XML into
    PL/SQL after the usual publishing step.


======================================
Changes in 0.1.2 (released 05/26/2004)
======================================

  * Optimized the stringify function. It will no longer generate
    empty string constants now.


======================================
Changes in 0.1.1 (released 05/19/2004)
======================================

  * Added XIST to the list of required software.


====================================
Changes in 0.1 (released 05/18/2004)
====================================

  * Initial release.
