                                History
                                =======

Changes in 0.9.1 (released 01/24/2007)
======================================

     * Fixed a bug related to empty CLOBs.

Changes in 0.9 (released 06/29/2006)
====================================

     * setuptools is supported for installation now.

Changes in 0.8 (released 04/18/2006)
====================================

     * The class Publisher has been removed.
     * When the new processing instruction proc appears in the
       source, xml2ora will generate a procedure instead of a
       function. This procedure must have c_out as an appropriate out
       variable.

Changes in 0.7.1 (released 11/11/2005)
======================================

     * The write generated for appending CLOBs to c_out uses
       DBMS_LOB.APPEND now instead of DBMS_LOB.WRITEAPPEND.

Changes in 0.7 (released 10/31/2005)
====================================

     * xml2ora operates on unicode strings now and will no longer
       escape byte values above 127 as char(c). The encoding argument
       is gone now.

Changes in 0.6.3 (released 06/21/2005)
======================================

     * Rewrote string output: Each string fragment will now be
       shipped with a separate call to the write procedure. This
       fixes several bugs with long strings.

Changes in 0.6.2 (released 06/10/2005)
======================================

     * If the return value of the generated function is NCLOB or
       NVARCHAR2, all generated string constants will have an N
       prefix now.

Changes in 0.6.1 (released 03/22/2005)
======================================

     * Added a note about the package init file to the installation
       documentation.

Changes in 0.6 (released 01/03/2005)
====================================

     * toxic now requires the core module and Python 2.4.

Changes in 0.5.1 (released 11/23/2004)
======================================

     * The local clob writing procedures are now defined after the
       local variables.

Changes in 0.5 (released 11/11/2004)
====================================

     * When the return type is a CLOB, then writing to the CLOB is
       done via local procedures in the generated function, that use
       the DBMS_LOB package for writing to the CLOB. This speeds up
       the functions tremendously (a factor of 100 is possible).

Changes in 0.4 (released 10/27/2004)
====================================

     * It's now possible to specify the return type of the generated
       function (via the processing instruction type).
     * ll.toxic is compatible to XIST 2.6 now.

Changes in 0.3 (released 07/06/2004)
====================================

     * A new function prettify is included that tries to fix the
       indentation of a PL/SQL snippet.
     * OraclePublisher has been renamed to Publisher.

Changes in 0.2 (released 07/01/2004)
====================================

     * A bug in tokenize that surfaced when the PI didn't have data,
       has been fixed.
     * OraclePublisher now no longer creates the function directly.
       Instead it's just a normal publisher that transforms the XML
       into PL/SQL after the usual publishing step.

Changes in 0.1.2 (released 05/26/2004)
======================================

     * Optimized the stringify function. It will no longer generate
       empty string constants now.

Changes in 0.1.1 (released 05/19/2004)
======================================

     * Added XIST to the list of required software.

Changes in 0.1 (released 05/18/2004)
====================================

     * Initial release.
