0.2 (2009-12-22)
----------------

* Added a ResourceLibrary component that is a mix between a Library
  and a GroupInclusion. It allows to declare both the Library and the
  Resources in a single class but impacts the re-usability.

* Library now directly inherits from grokcore.view.DirectoryResource,
  to inherit the `get` method behavior. This inheritance was avoided
  to prevent grokkers clash (grokcore.view.DirectoryResource grokker
  doesn't have a fallback for the `name` directive.). Our grokker has
  now the priority and explicitly set the `name` directive value.
