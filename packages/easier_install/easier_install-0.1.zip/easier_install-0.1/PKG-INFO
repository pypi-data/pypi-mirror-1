Description: Easily create setup.py files for easy_install / setuptools
        
        I'm too lazy to author setup.py files for installation of simple python modules
        and scripts, and setuptools/easy_install is very handy for installing scripts
        "properly" on both win32 and unix. Hence this script for creating a functional
        setup.py quickly. It's perfectly usable for creating source and binary distributions
        as well.
        
        Quick guide:
        
        - Go to a directory with lots of python modules (no packages!).
        - If the directory name is /home/foo/bar, 'bar' will be used as the name of
        the distribution.
        - If a python module has 'def main' in it, it's considered executable
        - Run easier_install
        - Review the resulting ei_setup.py and run it, as instructed.
