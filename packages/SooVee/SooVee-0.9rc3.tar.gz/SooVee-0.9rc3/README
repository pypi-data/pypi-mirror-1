SooVee Serial Audio Player

-- About --
Using Podiobooks.com for my free audio book needs, I decided to create SooVee,
more as an exercise, than function.  SooVee has become a nice interface for my
Podiobooks.com subscriptions.  I have worked hard to add most important features
of any  Podiobooks.com  account and  hope you  may find use  with SooVee, but I
place no warranty or gaurantee as to fitness or function for you.

-- Applications --
[pbterm.py]-- A terminal program for managment of your Podiobooks.com account.
    * Subscribe or unsubscribe to a subscription by its feed id.
    * Release episodes for a subscription by its feed id.
    * Format your subscriptions and select Podiobooks.com pages.
    * Update the subscriptions in the local cache.

[pbview.py]-- A graphical viewer to play and fetch your Podiobooks.com content.
    * View subscription cover, summary, and episodes.
    * Download subscription episodes to your computer.
    * Listen to subscription episodes without downloading.
    * Update the subscriptions in local cache.

-- Important --
SooVee requires a Podiobooks.com account at this time.  Activating accounts must
be done on the website.  Subscribing  to a serial audio feed  is only  available
with svterm.py.   SooVee utilizes  a user's opml  subscriptions file on a serial
audio  feed site to  locate the  rss  feeds  and  display  information  about  a
subscribed  serial audio  feed.  Some features  of pbterm.py  currently expect a 
specific Podiobooks.com page format to function.
