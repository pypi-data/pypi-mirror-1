Description: 
        Chat Relater
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Chat Relater is a tool consisting of two command-line scripts:
        
        * The analyzer extracts user relations from chat logs. The gained data is
        serialized as YAML.
        * The visualizer takes that data and utilizes GraphViz_ to create a graph.
        
        It is actually a conceptual clone of the PieSpy_ Social Network Bot. However,
        Chat Relater does not act as an IRC bot (although this could be easily
        accomplished by making use of the irclib_ package), but therefore allows to
        be run on any logfiles that produce similar output to those created by
        XChat_. Of course, this includes logs from Jabber, SILC or any other
        communication (but it might require some minor changes to the log reader).
        
        The GraphViz usage is pretty basic and output may be improved somehow, but
        so far, the graphs created by PieSpy look **much** nicer.
        
        Python_ 2.5 or higher is required. Required Python packages are declared in
        the setup script.
