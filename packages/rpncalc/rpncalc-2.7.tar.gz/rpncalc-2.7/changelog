2.7 Bug-fix Release - Mar 14, 2009

* Update the included clnum package.


2.6 Enhancement Release - Oct 18, 2008

* Update the included clnum package.

* Added code generator to the chebyshev module.


2.5 Enhancement Release - Nov 19, 2006

* Update the included clnum package.

* Added ratapx and unique_roots commands.


2.4 Enhancement Release - Aug 18, 2006

* Update the included clnum package.

* Added combinatorial functions.


2.3 Enhancement Release - May 6, 2006

* Update the included clnum package.

* Include documentation for building clnum on Windows.


2.2 Enhancement Release - Nov 27, 2005

* Display only 12 digits of a mpf or cmpf value.

* Added stats function.

* Added chebyshev module.

* Added solve command.

* Simplified installing user functions into the calculator.

* Added on-line help.


2.1 Enhancement Release - Sep 10, 2005

* Enhanced the polynomial root finder so that it performs better on
  ill-conditioned polynomials.


2.0 Enhancement Release - Aug 18, 2005

* Added function to compute the roots of a polynomial.

* Added functions to save and restore the stacks and user variables.

* Added clnum package which provides arbitrary precision floats and rationals
  in both real and complex forms.  Also provides the functions in the standard
  math and cmath libraries in extended precision floating point.

* Switched the RPN interpreter to use the clnum package for all operations.
  The standard Python float and complex are still available but require an
  explicit conversion.

* Switched ratfun so that it requires the clnum package.  This simplified some
  of the code for handling integer coefficients.  It also makes it possible to
  use Laguerre's method for finding the roots of polynomials.

* Changed the license to the GPL because the clnum package uses a GPL library.


1.2 Enhancement Release - Jan 2, 2005

* Added ratfun module that provides polynomial and rational function classes.
  These classes support mixed arithmetic where numbers, polynomials, and
  rational functions can be combined in a Python expression.

* Incorporate a syntax that allows entering polynomials and rational functions
  from the RPN interpreter.


1.1 Enhancement Release - Dec 21, 2004

* Stack checking gives an appropriate error message instead of aborting to the
  Python interpreter.

* Exceptions are handled within the RPN interpreter instead of aborting to the
  Python interpreter.  This makes recovery much simpler since there are very
  few situations that actually require the Python interpreter for recovery.

* Vocabularies are now ordered by priority.  A complete list of all the
  currently defined vocabularies is available from within the interpreter.

* User can select degrees or radians mode for trig functions.

* Added extended precision floating point using the gmpy module.

* Added a const module that provides some physical constants in SI (MKS) units.

* Converted to a Python package to simplify future expansion.


1.0.1 Bug-fix Release - Nov 28, 2004

* Fixed broken symlink problem.


1.0 Initial Public Release - Nov 26, 2004
