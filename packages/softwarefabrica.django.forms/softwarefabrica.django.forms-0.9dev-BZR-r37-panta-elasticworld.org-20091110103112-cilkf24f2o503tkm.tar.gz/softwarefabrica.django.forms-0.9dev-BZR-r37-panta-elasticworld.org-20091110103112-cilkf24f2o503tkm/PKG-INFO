        What is this?
        =============
        
        This is a forms library for `Django`_ projects, which aims at providing increased
        functionality and flexibility to the standard `forms library`_ (aka `newforms`).
        
        Your help and feedback is precious. Suggestions and contributions are very much
        appreciated. See below on how you can contribute.
        
        If you want to actively collaborate and provide code, documentation, tests or
        bug fixes, please feel free to create a new Bazaar branch in Launchpad, and tell
        us about it! See the collaboration_ section for more information.
        
        And don't forget to check also our other `Django`_ applications,
        `softwarefabrica.django.utils`_, `softwarefabrica.django.crud`_, and
