Description: z3c.recipe.tag
        ==============
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        This recipe generates a TAGS database file that can be used with a
        number of different editors to quickly lookup class and function
        definitions in your package's source files and egg dependencies.
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        Before running a tags enabled buildout, you must install the
        appropriate command line tag generation tools: exuberant-ctags and
        id-utils.  In Ubuntu, you can install these with apt-get::
        
        $ sudo apt-get install exuberant-ctags id-utils
        
        On a Mac, download and install ``port`` from http://www.macports.org/ and then
        install ctags and utils in this way::
        
        $ sudo port install ctags idutils
        
        How to use this recipe
        ----------------------
        
        Suppose you have an egg called ``MyApplication``.  To use this recipe with
        buildout, you would add the following to the ``buildout.cfg`` file::
        
        [tags]
        recipe = z3c.recipe.tag:tags
        eggs = MyApplication
        
        This produces a script file in the ``bin/`` directory which you can
        then run like this::
        
        $ ./bin/tags
        
        By default, this script produces three files in the directory from
        which you ran the script:
        
        - a ctags file called ``TAGS`` for use by emacs,
        - a ctags file called ``tags`` for use by vi, and
        - an idutils file called ``ID`` for use by either.
        
        You can then use these file in your editor of choice.
        
        Optionally, you can select which files to build.  The following is the output
        of ``./bin/tags --help``::
        
        usage: build_tags [options]
        
        options:
        -h, --help            show this help message and exit
        -l LANGUAGES, --languages=LANGUAGES
        ctags comma-separated list of languages. defaults to
        ``-JavaScript``
        -e, --ctags-emacs     flag to build emacs ctags ``TAGS`` file
        -v, --ctags-vi        flag to build vi ctags ``tags`` file
        -b, --ctags-bbedit    flag to build bbedit ctags ``tags`` file
        -i, --idutils         flag to build idutils ``ID`` file
        
        (BBEdit_ is a Macintosh text editor.)

        0.2.0 (2008-08-28)
        ------------------
        
        * Allow command-line choices for what files to build, and what languages ctags
        should parse.  (Note that the default behavior of running ``./bin/tags``
        is the same as previous releases.)
        
        * Support the Mac OS X packaging system "macports" (exuberant ctags is
        ``ctags-exuberant`` in Ubuntu and ``ctags`` in macports).
        
        * Support creating BBEdit-style ctags files.
        
        * Small changes for development (use bootstrap external, set svn:ignore)
        
        0.1.0 (2008-03-16)
