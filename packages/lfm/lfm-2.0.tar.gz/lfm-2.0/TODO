General:
========
Medium Priority:
  + general
    - use CONSTANTS instead of curses.color_pair(x)
  + ui
    - redesign dialogs to fill window dimensions
    - don't redraw screen after each keystroke
    - copy/move dialog: use file block-by-block progress bar
    - tab views:
      . 2 columns mode
      . customized: permissions instead of date
    - rewrite messages.py
    - investigate if curses.Textbox could be interesting
  + improvements over present features
    - symlinks navigation. symlink has to return to a parent dir.
    - non copied moved / renamed / deleted files should remain selected
    - recursive chmod chown chgrp. Checkbuttons: recursive, ignore dirs
    - exclude files (f.e. *.o) to grep
      . ".#filename" are temporary emacs files/links
  + new features:
    - hot-key to toggle hidden files showing: C-h
    - "save delete" option => move to ~/.Trash
    - historic navigation: mc: Alt-Y / Alt-U
    - command line
      . make command-line run ipython interpreter
    - global copy/cut/paste between tabs or panes
    - crypt / hash files
    - plugins system

Low Priority (maybe some day):
  + keybindings customization
  + new vfs: .rpm, .deb, .jar, .xpi, .egg
  + remote vfs: ssh, ftp, smb, webdav
  + i18n
  + sessions
  + pyview: tab 4/8 chars
  + complex commands, make it configurable:
    - show directory under cursor in the other panel: mc: Alt+O
    - exec some command over (selected files) with pattern substitution
      eg. convert $file $file.jpeg

Very Low Priority (never):
  + mouse support
  + a gui to configure preferences


Known Bugs:
===========
+ general:
  - "lfm path" fails if path contains spaces, caused by shell 'lfm' function
  - actions.py:
    . after renaming a file, cursor should be placed over the new file name,
      but this is not always posible because we don't know new file name
  - if an error happens while copying/moving/uncompressing/... =>
    => some rubbish remain in destination

+ compress.py:
  - rar with password halts lfm, because process is waiting for a password =>
    => timeout if not output and kill the spawned process
  - recursively chmod +w temp files before deleting

+ vfs.py:
  - .tar.gz inside a .tar.gz file (vfs in vfs)
  - tmpdir are showed in the copy/move/... dialogs or when view/edit/...
    a file, instead of vfs dir (this is just a estetic issue)
  - in case of 'panelize' vfs type (after find/grep), deleted / moved
    files are not deleted / moved in real path
