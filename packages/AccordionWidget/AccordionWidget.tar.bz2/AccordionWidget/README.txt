You need a working installation of Turbogears (>=1.0.1) and MochiKit (>=1.4).
To install digit from here (as root if needed):

> python setup.py develop 

and than,

> tg-admin toolbox 

to see the example.


To install MochiKit simple replace the MochiKit.js of a standard Turbogears installation (v1.3.1), 
with the new one downloaded from MochiKit site.
( TG on Ubuntu/Edgy location is /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/TurboGears-1.0.1-py2.4.egg/turbogears/static/js/MochiKit.js ) 

Good experience ;-) !

This is a TurboGears (http://www.turbogears.org) widget project.
You can view the widgets in the Toolbox.
