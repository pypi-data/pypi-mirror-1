        Change history
        ==============
        
        0.1b2 - (2009-11-10)
        --------------------
        
        * The manifest file excluded the GS xml. Fixed
        
        0.1b1 - (2009-11-09)
        --------------------
        
        * Added tool for creating member areas which is called by the overriden, login_next.cpy in skins.
        Subscribers don't work for this case, and it wasn't a good idea to let Plone run createMemberArea script.
        
        * Firstname and Lastname are now installed as default.
        
        * Added controlpanel for choosing firstname / lastname or userid as title.
        
        * Removed overrides.zcml - Blocking the Plone dashboard should be optional, or a skin
        
        * getText is no longer an accessor for description changed. Now description is more of a tagline, and text field can be biography or similar.
        
        * Managed to get rid of all subscribers. Everything works without them now.
        
        * Controlpanel for membership ids, so it's possible to enable only lowercase ids. (Uses portal_registration tool)
        
        0.1b - (2009-10-30)
        -------------------
