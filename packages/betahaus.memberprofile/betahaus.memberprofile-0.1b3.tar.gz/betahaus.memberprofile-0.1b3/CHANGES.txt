--------------------

* Added tool for creating member areas which is called by the overriden, login_next.cpy in skins.
  Subscribers don't work for this case, and it wasn't a good idea to let Plone run createMemberArea script. [robinharms]

* Firstname and Lastname are now installed as default. [robinharms]

* Added controlpanel for choosing firstname / lastname or userid as title. [robinharms]

* Removed overrides.zcml - Blocking the Plone dashboard should be optional, or a skin [robinharms]

* getText is no longer an accessor for description changed. Now description is more of a tagline, and text field can be biography or similar. [robinharms]

* Managed to get rid of all subscribers. Everything works without them now. [robinharms]

* Controlpanel for membership ids, so it's possible to enable only lowercase ids. (Uses portal_registration tool) [robinharms]
