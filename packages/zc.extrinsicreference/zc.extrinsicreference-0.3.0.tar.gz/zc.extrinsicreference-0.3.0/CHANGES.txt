0.3.0 (2009-08-27)
------------------

- Fix errors introduced in 0.2.0 refactoring:

  1. Stop referring to extrinsicreference module from ZCML.
     The code is now in ``__init__.py``.

  2. Revert `registerShortcut` and `unregisterShortcut` changes.
     These two functions are handlers in ``track_shortcuts.zcml``.

  3. Add more package infrastructure, such as this file.


0.2.0 (2009-08-26)
------------------

- Refactored an existing stable code.
- Initial release as an egg.
