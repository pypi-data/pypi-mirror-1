Description: Overview
        ========
        
        IMDbName is a console script that allows users to rename movie files intelligently using information from the IMDb database.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The recommended way to install IMDbName is with `easy_install <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_, as shown here (in a UNIX-like environment)::
        
        # easy_install imdbname
        
        If *easy_install* is not available, IMDbName can also be installed using the *setup.py* file included in the distribution. Simply download the source distribution below, unarchive it, and run the setup script as follows::
        
        # python setup.py install
        
        Both options install both the IMDbName package in your Python *site-packages* directory, as well as the executable script (*imdbname*) in the setuptools script directory. In \*nix systems, this is usually */usr/bin/*.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Assuming the directory setuptools puts console scripts is part of your PATH, IMDbName can be run as follows::
        
        $ imdbname [options] FILE1 [FILE2 FILE3 ...]
        
        Where every *FILE* is a movie file to be renamed. The `--help` option shows all command line options, also listed here:
        
        ``--version``
        Prints the program's version number and exits.
        
        ``-h``, ``--help``
        Prints the program's usage, description, and command line options, then exits.
        
        ``--license``
        Prints the program's license information and exits.
        
        ``--verbose``
        Prints extra helpful information during program execution.
        
        ``-a``, ``--assume-correct``
        If only one exact title match is found, assume it is the correct movie and don't prompt the user to verify.
        
        ``-f FORMATSTRING``, ``--format=FORMATSTRING``
        Allows the user to specify the format for the output filenames of the program, using the *FORMATSTRING* argument. See below for valid format specifiers [default: "``%t (%y)``"].
