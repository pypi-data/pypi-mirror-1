Description: 
        Pypes provides a framework for building component oriented architectures. It
        falls under the paradigm of Flow-Based Programming in which applications are
        defined as networks of "black box" processes, which exchange data across
        predefined connections called ports. These black box processes can be
        reconnected endlessly to form different applications without having to be
        changed internally. The concept is very similar, if not identical, to that of
        Unix pipes.
        
        Pypes is designed to build applications in a more data centric manner where
        data flow is more prominent than control flow.
        
        For detailed information regarding Flow-Based Programming concepts please see
        J. Paul Morrison's Book titled `Flow-Based Programming`_.
