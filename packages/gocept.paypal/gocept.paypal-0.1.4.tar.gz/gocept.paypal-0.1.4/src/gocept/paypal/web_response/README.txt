This script shows the GET-Parameter TOKEN in the browser. You will need it for testing the paypal callbacks.

Copy the index.php file to a webserver which is reachable from the internet.
Don't forget to edit the CALLBACK_URL in your config_tests.py.

If you don't want this or are not able to do it, you can just use http://paypaltest.gocept.com
