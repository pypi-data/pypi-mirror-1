Description: 
        This package provides a reference parser and database importer for the
        United States Senate LD-1/LD-2 lobbying disclosure database. The
        Senate provides the database as a series of XML documents,
        downloadable here:
        
        http://www.senate.gov/legislative/Public_Disclosure/database_download.htm
        
        The SQL database schema used by the importer is a direct translation
        of the XML schema used in the Senate documents. This isn't a
        particularly useful format for analyzing lobbying data, but it is
        useful for analyzing the lobbying records themselves, which often
        contain errors or anomalies. In any case, it shouldn't be too
        difficult to adapt the importing code in this package to a more useful
        schema.
