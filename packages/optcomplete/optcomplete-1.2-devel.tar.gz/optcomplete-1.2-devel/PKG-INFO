Description: 
        This module provide automatic bash completion support for programs that use the
        optparse module.  The premise is that the optparse options parser specifies
        enough information (and more) for us to be able to generate completion strings
        esily.  Another advantage of this over traditional completion schemes where the
        completion strings are hard-coded in a separate bash source file, is that the
        same code that parses the options is used to generate the completions, so the
        completions is always up-to-date with the program itself.
        
        In addition, we allow you specify a list of regular expressions or code that
        define what kinds of files should be proposed as completions to this file if
        needed.  If you want to implement more complex behaviour, you can instead
        specify a function, which will be called with the current directory as an
        argument.
        
        You need to activate bash completion using the shell script function that comes
        with optcomplete (see http://furius.ca/optcomplete for more details).
