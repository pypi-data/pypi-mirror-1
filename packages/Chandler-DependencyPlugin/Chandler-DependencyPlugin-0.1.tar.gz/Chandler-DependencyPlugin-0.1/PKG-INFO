Description: This plugin adds rudimentary dependency tracking between items in Chandler.
        
        To set an item as a dependency, copy the item, select another item, then go to the Edit > Dependencies menu.  New Dependencies and Blocking menus will be added to items, selecting a dependency or blocker will navigate to that item.
        
        There is currently no way to remove a dependency.
        
        To download and install the plugin from the Chandler UI,
        use the "Plugins -> Download" and "Plugins -> Install" menus.
        
        To download and install the plugin from the command line, use Chandler's
        InstallPlugin script and restart Chandler::
        
        InstallPlugin Chandler-DependencyPlugin
        
        If you want to work on its code, you can use::
        
        RunPython setup.py develop
        
        to install it in development mode (where you can make changes and have them
        take effect whenever Chandler is restarted), or you can use::
        
        RunPython setup.py install
        
        to install it as an ``.egg`` file.
        
        Note that when installed as an egg file, changes made to the source code will
        not affect Chandler execution, until you run ``setup.py install`` or ``setup.py
        develop`` again.
        
        After making changes to this plugin, you should update its version number in
        ``setup.py`` and in the chandler/Makefile, so that people using "quick builds"
        of Chandler will use your new version.
        
        If you want to run this plugin's tests use::
        
        RunPython setup.py test
