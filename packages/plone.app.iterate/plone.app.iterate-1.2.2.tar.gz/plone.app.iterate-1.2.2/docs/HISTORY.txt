1.2.1 (November 11th 2008)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Refine permissions fix from 1.2.0 and make tests pass again:

  - Don't require Modify Portal Content (MPC) permission on the
    original to check out, which was omitted in the fix for 1.2.0.

  - Don't require MPC on the original for cancelling of checkout, only
    require it on the working copy.
