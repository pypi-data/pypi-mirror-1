Description: Polyform Puzzler is a software toolkit for exploring &
        solving polyform puzzles, like Pentominoes and Soma Cubes.
        It consists of a set of front-end applications for specific
        polyform puzzles and a Python library that does the heavy
        lifting.  New polyforms and new puzzles can easily be
        defined and added.  Requires Python 2.4 or higher.
