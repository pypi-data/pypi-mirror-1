Description: armsim is an ARM Simulator for Linux
        
        Objective
        ---------
        armsim has the objective of simulating arm based processors starting with the
        at91sam9260
        
        nonetheless, it is designed to be extensible, so you'll be able to write you
        own classes to plug in you microcontroller
        
        Is is designed for Linux and Python2.6 so be sure you have these requirements.
        
        Current Status
        --------------
        Currently a total of 20 instructions are supported, even tough most of them
        are recognized.
        
        The project is being developed quickly so you can expect the complete
        instruction set to be supported in a few weeks
