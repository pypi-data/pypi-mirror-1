Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        A drop in package for Plone that improves the copy and paste operation
        of folder structures. UID inline links are rewritten if they reference
        any of the content within the folder structure being copied so that
        they now link to the copied content.
        
        
        Todo
        ====
        
        * Should also update references to any related items.

        Installation
        ============
        
        This package requires Plone 3.x or later (tested on 3.3.x).
        
        If you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe
        to manage your project, you can add ``collective.updatelinksoncopy``
        to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
        
        [buildout]
        ...
        eggs =
        ...
        collective.updatelinksoncopy
        
        (If you are working with a version of Plone < 3.3 then you'll also
        need to install a ZCML slug.)
