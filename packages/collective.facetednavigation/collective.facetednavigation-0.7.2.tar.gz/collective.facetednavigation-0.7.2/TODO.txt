To do (or in progress)
======================

- see
  http://www.openplans.org/projects/paris-bobun-sprint/faceted-navigation
  (except the "cache" section since it has already been implemented)

- rewrite user interface with a table-less layout (or, at least, use
  Plone CSS classes and fix the layout)

- replace template-base implementation by content provider and
  viewlets
