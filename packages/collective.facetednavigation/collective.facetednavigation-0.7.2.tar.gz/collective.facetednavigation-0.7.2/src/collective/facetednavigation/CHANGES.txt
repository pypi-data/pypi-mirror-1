==============================================
List of changes in Faceted Navigation versions
==============================================

unreleased version 0.7.2
========================

- When showing or hiding a facet, only hide the parentnode div with
  the 'block' class; otherwise parentnode somehow selects grandparants
  etc as well, effectively hiding everything on the page.

2009-11-09 version 0.7.1
========================

- be nice with Setuptools 0.7 by calling ``declare_namespace()`` in
  ``collective.__init__.py``.
- added support for Spanish localization
- fixed the faceted navigation action to not override the sitemap one


What's new in Faceted Navigation 0.7
====================================

- restricted setup handlers to our profile only. Thanks to Gilles
  Lenfant for the trick;

- added a dedicated catalog. Beware, you will have to manually create
  this catalog if you already installed have an earlier version of
  Faceted Navigation. Look at the code for the default indexes and
  columns (``exportimport.addIndexesAndMetadata()``). I would also
  suggest reinstalling the product. See ``doc/install.txt`` for
  further details;

- added a new configuration option that lets an administrator define
  default search criteria, e.g. ``review state;published``;

- implemented different cache policies;

- rewrote some of the tests.


What's new in Faceted Navigation 0.6.1
======================================

- re-released with a more recent version of ``easy_install``. The egg
  for the 0.6 release had only Python files... Thanks to Jon Stahl for
  reporting `this bug`_;

- fixed a (hardly noticeable) bug in ``setup.py`` about namespace
  package.

What's new in Faceted Navigation 0.6
====================================

- first public release.
