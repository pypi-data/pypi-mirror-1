        Collective Faceted Navigation
        =============================
        
        What is faceted navigation (the concept)
        ========================================
        
        First, what is faceted classification::
        
        A faceted classification system allows the assignment of multiple
        classifications to an object, enabling the classifications to be
        ordered in multiple ways, rather than in a single, pre-determined,
        taxonomic order.
        
        -- Wikipedia (Faceted classification)
        
        Once we know what faceted classification is, we can infer what is a
        faceted browser::
        
        A faceted browser or faceted semantic browser is a user interface
        which makes use of faceted classification to allow the user to
        explore by filtering available information. Each facet typically
        corresponds to the possible values of a property common to a set
        of digital objects.
        
        -- Wikipedia (Faceted browser)
        
        An example would help, I guess::
        
        A traditional restaurant guide might group restaurants first by
        location, then by type, price, rating, awards, ambiance, and
        amenities. In a faceted system, a user might decide first to
        divide the restaurants by price, and then by location and then by
        type, while another user could first sort the restaurants by type
        and then by awards. Thus, faceted navigation, like taxonomic
        navigation, guides users by showing them available categories (or
        facets), but does not require them to browse through a hierarchy
        that may not precisely suit their needs or way of thinking.

        - `Faceted classification`_ in Wikipedia;
        
        - `Faceted browser`_ in Wikipedia.
        
        Various examples of faceted navigation are also available on the
        home page of the MIT `Exhibit`_ project.

        What is Faceted Navigation (the Plone product)
        ==============================================
        
        This concept sounds cool, but what does Faceted Navigation (the
        product) exactly do?
        
        Once we have installed the product, we will have to configure facets
        (i.e. criteria), which are actually linked to default or custom
        catalog indexes. Then the user will see a new link in the portal
        actions bar (along "site map" and other links), called "Faceted
        navigation". This link leads to an user interface that lets the user
        browse portal items via... a faceted navigation.
        
        **Warning:** I do not pretend to be an expert on this subject, nor do
        I think that this is the definitive implementation of this concept in
        Plone. I also have other user interfaces in mind; they could probably
        be implemented using the current code. Anyway, there are a lot of
        ideas floating around: a good start would be the `Plone
        classification`_ workspace on OpenPlans.

        Examples
        ========
        
        Example applications have been set up:
        
        - `Burgers`_;
        
        - PyPi - Python packages (in development);
        
        - Nobel Prizes (in development).
        
        Feel free to try them and provide feedback.

        Dependencies
        ============
        
        Server-side
        -----------
        
        This version has the following dependencies:
        
        - Plone 3.0.x or Plone 3.1.x
        
        This product might also work with Plone 2.5 (probably with a
        backported version of KSS, though).
        
        
        Browser-side
        ------------
        
        The user interface makes use of KSS. Therefore, Javascript must be
        activated. There is no plan to provide a non-Javascript version.
        
        The user interface should work on all modern browsers. It has been
        successfully tested on the following ones:
        
        - Firefox 2;
        
        - Opera 9;
        
        - Microsoft Internet Explorer 6;
        
        - Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.
        
        Support for earlier versions and other browsers is not planned.
