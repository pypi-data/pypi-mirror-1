Strangeness
+++++++++++

These are just some notes to myself about things that seem strange. (James)::

    <% c.form.layout.sub_question_start(
        title="Project ID",
        c.form.field.text(name='project_id') ) %>
    
    is fine but 
    
    <% c.form.layout.sub_question_start(
        title="Project ID",
        c.form.field.text(name='project_id') 
    ) %>
    
    Can't create a controller with the same name as the package itself.

    m.subexec() doesn't raise errors - is this expected (in which case we should always use m.comp() in the docs.
    
    POST doesn't work in security
