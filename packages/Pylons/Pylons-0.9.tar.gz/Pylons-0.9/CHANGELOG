Pylons Changelog
=================

0.9 (**dev**)
* config file option 'debug' now defaults to false when undefined
* Removed the components directory from the template
* Updated paste.errordocuments support
* Fix for multi-word controller names such that front_page / 
  FrontPageController can be used as a controller name. Patch contributed
  by Timo Mihaljov.
* Cleaned up imports in wsgiapp and new project to better reflect where
  things really come from.
* Removed unnecessary myghty usage from wsgiapp for url unescaping, now
  uses urllib as the myghty function did.
* Removing 'response' to import, sticking with Response as its more
  consistent with the fact that Response is a class/factory and not an
  instance like request, and the other lower-case objects.
* Added redirect_to under pylons.helpers, and added import from helpers
  directly into lib/base.py for use in controllers.
* Consolidated legacy objects into legacy module.
* Adding abort method that raises the appropriate exception for the status
  code.
* Removing form_fill, obsolete by the validate decorator.
* Relocated 'params' object to only take effect in legacy mode.
* Updated Pylons template to use WSGIController as the new default Controller.
* Altered the wsgi dispatch to examine the controller, and instantiate it if
  it's just a class. Otherwise, if the controller is a subclass of Controller
  but not of WSGIController, it assumes its an older Controller class that
  may return a WSGIResponse, and calls it appropriately.
* Dispatch now fixes up environ to move 'path_info' Route var into the WSGI
  PATH_INFO, and the rest is pushed into SCRIPT_NAME. This is for use with
  other WSGI apps under controller mount points.
* Added WSGIController which takes a normal WSGI interface call and returns
  the appropriate WSGI response.
* Added automatic copying of Route variables declared in an action's
  function definition to the 'c' object.
* WebHelpers' .js files are now automatically published under the 
  '/javascripts/' URL path. Individual WebHelpers' .js files can be
  overridden by other .js files inside the project's 'public/javascripts'
  directory
* Added exception toss when a template engine doesn't exist.
* Added alias option to Buffet to support aliasing more template engines
  to other engine names
* Buffet enhancements to support caching of any template with any template
  engine
* All render commands processed through Buffet
* Backwards compatibility 'm' object for use with legacy projects
* Added use of Beaker middleware for session and caching functionality
* Fixed error traceback and updated template to use proper error images and
  stylesheets.

0.8.2 (**dev**)
* Fixed default controller to allow for actions with - in them. The - will be
  replaced with an underscore, while the original action name in the mapper
  dict is unchanged. Patch by Thomas Sidwick.

0.8.1 (May 10th, 2006)
* Added REST decorators and re-arranged decorator layout to support more styles
  of decorators for future expansion.
* Fixed dependency requirement bug that had Pylons locked to simplejson 1.1
  even though a newer version was out.
