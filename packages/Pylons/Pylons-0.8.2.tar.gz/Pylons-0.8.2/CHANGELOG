Pylons Changelog
=================

0.8.2 (**dev**)
* Fixed bool value for proxy object so that "if params:" works as expected.
  Reported by noid.
* Updated EvalException sub-class to be more in sync with the latest one for
  debugging.
* Fixed default controller to allow for actions with - in them. The - will be
  replaced with an underscore, while the original action name in the mapper
  dict is unchanged. Patch by Thomas Sidwick.
