Description: 
        The Pylons web framework is aimed at making webapps and large programmatic website
        development in Python easy. Several key points:
        
        * A framework to make writing web applications in Python easy
        
        * Inspired by Rails and TurboGears
        
        * Utilizes a minimalist, component-based philosophy that makes it easy to expand on
        
        * Built mainly as a customization of Myghty with Routes and Paste integration
        
        * Harness existing knowledge about Python
        
        Knowing Python makes Pylons easy
        ---------------------------------
        
        Pylons makes it easy to expand on your knowledge of Python to master Pylons for web
        development. Using a MVC style dispath, Python knowledge is used at various levels:
        
        * The Controller is just a basic Python class, called for each request. Customizing the
        response is as easy as overriding __call__ to make your webapp work how you want.
        
        * Myghty templating compiles directly to Python byte-code for speed and utilizes Python
        for template control rather than creating its own template syntax for "for, while, etc"
        
        Current Status
        ---------------
        
        Pylons is currently quite stable (built mostly with the mature Myghty package), and is
        being used in production environments. Dependant packages are automatically installed
        from the following URL:
        
        * `Dependant Packages svn <http://www.pylonshq.com/download/>`_
