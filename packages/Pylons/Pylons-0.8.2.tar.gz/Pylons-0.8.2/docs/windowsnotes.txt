Post install tweaks for Windows
===============================

Python scripts installed as part of the Pylons install process will be put in the ``Scripts`` directory of your Python installation, typically in ``C:\Python24\Scripts``. By default on Windows this directory is not on your ``PATH`` which means that if you open up a command prompt and type a command like ``paster`` you might see something similar to the following::

	C:\Documents and Settings\James>paster
	'paster' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
	operable program or batch file.

To be able to use the scripts installed with Pylons you either have to use the full path::

	C:\Documents and Settings\James>C:\Python24\Scripts\paster
	Usage: C:\Python24\Scripts\paster-script.py COMMAND
	usage: paster-script.py [paster_options] COMMAND [command_options]

	options:
	  --version         show program's version number and exit
	  --plugin=PLUGINS  Add a plugin to the list of commands (plugins are Egg
			    specs; will also require() the Egg)
	  -h, --help        Show this help message
	
	... etc ...
	
or a better solution is to add your ``Scripts`` directory to the ``PATH`` as described next.

For Win2K or WinXP
------------------

#. From the desktop or start menu, right click My Computer and click properties.
#. In the System Properties window, click on the Advanced tab.
#. In the Advanced section, click the Environment Variables button. 
#. Finally, in the Environment Variables window, highlight the path variable in the Systems Variable section and click edit. Add or modify the path lines with the paths you wish the computer to access. Each different directory is separated with a semicolon as shown below::

	C:\Program Files;C:\WINDOWS;C:\WINDOWS\System32
      
#. Add the path to your scripts directory::

	C:\Program Files;C:\WINDOWS;C:\WINDOWS\System32;C:\Python24\Scripts
	
See `Finally`_ below.
	
For Windows 95, 98 and ME
-------------------------

You will need to edit your ``autoexec.bat`` file so that your path is correctly setup. Add a line like this::

	path=%path%;C:\Python24\Scripts

:Warning: I haven't tested the above but this seems to be the correct thing to do. Please could someone confirm this works? Thanks JG.

See `Finally`_ below.

Finally
-------

You may need to restart your computer but now you can just enter the command you want in the same way you would on a Mac or on Linux::

	C:\Documents and Settings\James>paster
	Usage: C:\Python24\Scripts\paster-script.py COMMAND
	usage: paster-script.py [paster_options] COMMAND [command_options]

	options:
	  --version         show program's version number and exit
	  --plugin=PLUGINS  Add a plugin to the list of commands (plugins are Egg
			    specs; will also require() the Egg)
	  -h, --help        Show this help message
	
	... etc ...

All the documentation is written assuming you have set up your ``PATH`` correctly as described above.
