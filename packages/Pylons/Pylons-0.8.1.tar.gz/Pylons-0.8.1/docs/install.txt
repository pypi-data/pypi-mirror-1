Installing Pylons
+++++++++++++++++

#. Download the Pylons install file from http://pylons.groovie.org/files/ez_setup.py and run the command ``python ez_setup.py Pylons==dev`` to download and install all necessary files.

For absolutely the latest version (or to upgrade to the latest) run::

    sudo easy_install -U -D Pylons==dev
    
Windows users will need to install `subversion <http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html#binary-packages>`_ and issue this command::

    C:\Python24\Scripts\easy_install -U -D Pylons==dev

Further notes for Windows Users
===============================

Windows cannot run Python files without ``.py`` extensions as executable files. As a result all of the documentation where the command ``paster`` is issued will need to be replaced by::

    python C:\Python24\Scripts\paster
    
Alternatively, you can place the following in a file called ``paster.bat`` which you can create in your ``C:\WINDOWS`` directory or anywhere else on your path::

    python C:\Python24\Scripts\paster %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9
    
Then when you issue the ``paster`` command, the program above will be run and this will in turn run the correct paster command. You will need to replace ``C:\Python24\Scripts`` with wherever your correct python scripts directory is.

One word of caution is that this command only sends the first 9 arguments to the correct paster command so if you have a really long command with lots of spaces you will have to do it the full way. This method works for all examples in the documentation though.
