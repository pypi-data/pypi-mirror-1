Development Version

Installing The Development Version
==================================

`Subversion <http://subversion.tigris.org>`_ must be installed to retrieve the latest development version of Pylons. `Subversion packages <http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html#binary-packages>`_ are also available. 

Even if Windows users have Tortoise SVN installed they will still need the command line SVN tools described above, both systems can be installed at once.

Read the `Easy Install documentation <http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall>`_, to decide whether to install Pylons as a root user so it can be used by everyone or whether to use a `custom installation location <http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#custom-installation-locations>`_.

If you have easy install run:

.. code-block:: Bash

    $ easy_install -U http://pylonshq.com/svn/Pylons/trunk

Otherwise download `ez_setup.py <http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py>`_ and run:
    
.. code-block:: Bash

    $ python ez_setup.py -U http://pylonshq.com/svn/Pylons/trunk


Working Directly From the Source Code
=====================================

Check out the latest code:
	
.. code-block:: Bash

	$ svn co http://pylonshq.com/svn/Pylons/trunk Pylons

To tell setuptools to use the version you are editing in the ``Pylons`` directory:

.. code-block:: Bash

	$ cd Pylons
	$ python setup.py develop
	
Now you can make changes to the files in the Pylons directory and the code will run exactly as if you had installed a version of the egg with the changes you have made.
