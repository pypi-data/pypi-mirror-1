CheckSelect aims to solve a problem found with Multiple Select fields \
where it isn't possible to specify their widths, messing up with some \
layouts.  It also aims to make selecting multiple choices easier and \
more accessible for users of your application.  This is a widgetized \
version of Nicholas Rougeux code at http://c82.net/article.php?ID=25 \
that extends TurboGears' default CheckBoxList code.\
