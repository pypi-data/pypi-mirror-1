Version 0.6 2007-1-2

- Added an example project

- Added a BLOG_MEDIA_PREFIX setting so paths to media files are not hard-coded.

- Added templates:
  blogmaker/blog/templates/blog/blog_base.html
  blogmaker/blog/templates/registration/login.html
  blogmaker/comments/templates/comments/comment_preview.html

- Caching the comment form (e.g. with memcached) breaks the IP check in the comment honeypot. The IP check is now optional (and disabled by default) to allow caching. See /blogmaker/comments/templaatetags/comment_honeypot.py for details.

- Changed the package layout to put all code in the blogmaker package:
  /blogmaker/ moved to /blogmaker/blog/
  /comments/ moved to /blogmaker/comments/
  /prefab/ moved to /blogmaker/util/

Note: the above change requires changes to the database schema. See
  /blogmaker/blog/migrations/sql/MakeBlogPackage.sql and
  /blogmaker/blog/migrations/sql/MoreBlogPackage.sql
for details of the changes required with a PostgreSQL database.
