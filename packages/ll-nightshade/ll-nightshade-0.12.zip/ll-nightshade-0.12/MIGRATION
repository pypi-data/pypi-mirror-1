                   Migration and modernization guide
                   =================================

Migrating to version 0.10
=========================

   When a Connect object is used as a decorator the database
   connection is no longer passed to the decorated function. You have
   to store the Connect object somewhere and call it's new cursor
   explicitely.

Migrating to version 0.8
========================

   The class withconnection has been renamed to Connect.

   Calling functions and procedures has changed a bit. Replace the
   following old code:

 proc = nightshade.Call(orasql.Procedure("proc"), connectstring=connectstring)

 @cherrypy.expose
 def foo(arg):
    return proc(arg)

   with

 connection = nightshade.Connect(connectstring=connectstring)
 proc = nightshade.Call(orasql.Procedure("proc"), connection)

 @cherrypy.expose
 def foo(arg):
    return proc(arg)
