                                =======

Changes in 0.9 (released 07/18/2007)
====================================

     * Added support for the Cache-Control header.

Changes in 0.8.1 (released 06/26/2007)
======================================

     * Fixed a bug in Call.__call__ (calling the procedure wasn't
       retried after the connection got lost).

Changes in 0.8 (released 06/21/2007)
====================================

     * withconnection has been renamed to Connect and the
       implementation of __call__ has been fixed.
     * Call now needs a Connect object as the second argument in the
       constructor (instead of taking connectstring, pool and retry
       arguments).

Changes in 0.7.1 (released 05/12/2007)
======================================

     * Fixed a bug that surfaced after the connection to the database
       was lost.

Changes in 0.7 (released 03/16/2007)

       to retry database operations in case of stale connections.

Changes in 0.6 (released 03/12/2007)
====================================

     * Initial public release.
