Changes in 0.10 (released 09/04/2007)
=====================================

     * When a Connect object is used as a decorator the database
       connection is no longer passed to the decorated function. This
       means that there will no longer be any signature mismatch
       between the original function and the decorated function.
       However the Connect object must be stored somewhere else and
       the user must call the new cursor method to get a cursor.
     * Keyword argument in the Connect constructor are passed on the
       the connect call.

Changes in 0.9 (released 07/18/2007)
====================================

     * Added support for the Cache-Control header.

Changes in 0.8.1 (released 06/26/2007)
======================================

     * Fixed a bug in Call.__call__ (calling the procedure wasn't
       retried after the connection got lost).

Changes in 0.8 (released 06/21/2007)
====================================

     * withconnection has been renamed to Connect and the
       implementation of __call__ has been fixed.
     * Call now needs a Connect object as the second argument in the
       constructor (instead of taking connectstring, pool and retry
       arguments).

Changes in 0.7.1 (released 05/12/2007)
======================================

     * Fixed a bug that surfaced after the connection to the database
       was lost.

Changes in 0.7 (released 03/16/2007)
====================================

     * A new decorator withconnection has been added. This can be use
       to retry database operations in case of stale connections.

Changes in 0.6 (released 03/12/2007)
====================================

     * Initial public release.
