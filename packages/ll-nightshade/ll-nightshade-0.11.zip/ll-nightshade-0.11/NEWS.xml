<section><h>Changes in 0.10 (released 09/04/2007)</h>
<ul>
<li>When a <class>Connect</class> object is used as a decorator the
database connection is no longer passed to the decorated function. This means
that there will no longer be any signature mismatch between the original
function and the decorated function. However the <class>Connect</class> object
must be stored somewhere else and the user must call the new <meth>cursor</meth>
method to get a cursor.</li>

<li>Keyword argument in the <class>Connect</class> constructor are passed
on to the <func>connect</func> call.</li>
</ul>
