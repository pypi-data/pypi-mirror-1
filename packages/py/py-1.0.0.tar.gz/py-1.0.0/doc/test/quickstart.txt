.. _`setuptools installation`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools


==================
Quickstart
==================

.. _here: ../download.html#no-setuptools

This document assumes basic python knowledge and a working `setuptools
installation`_ (otherwise see here_). You can install
the py lib and py.test by typing::

    easy_install -U py 

Now open a file ``test_sample.py`` file and put the following
example content into it::

    # content of test_sample.py 
    def test_answer():
        assert 42 == 43 

You can now run the test file like this::

  py.test test_sample.py

and will see an error report on the failing assert statement.
