Marking functions and setting rich attributes
----------------------------------------------------

By default, all filename parts and class/function names of a test
function are put into the set of keywords for a given test.  You can
specify additional kewords like this::

    @py.test.mark.webtest 
    def test_send_http():
        ... 

This will set an attribute 'webtest' on the given test function
and by default all such attributes signal keywords.  You can 
also set values in this attribute which you could read from
a hook in order to do something special with respect to
the test function::

    @py.test.mark.timeout(seconds=5)
    def test_receive():
        ...

This will set the "timeout" attribute with a Marker object 
that has a 'seconds' attribute.
