pytest_xfail plugin
===================

mark python test functions as expected-to-fail and report them separately.

.. contents::
  :local:

usage
------------

Use the generic mark decorator to mark your test functions as 
'expected to fail':: 

    @py.test.mark.xfail
    def test_hello():
        ...

This test will be executed but no traceback will be reported 
when it fails. Instead terminal reporting will list it in the 
"expected to fail" section or "unexpectedly passing" section.
