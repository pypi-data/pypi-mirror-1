py lib: testing and distributed programming library 
====================================================

The ``py`` lib has several namespaces which help with testing,
generating and distributing code across machines.  Here is 
documentation on the most interesting ones:

`py.test`_ write and deploy unit- and functional tests to multiple machines. 

`py.execnet`_ elastic distributed programming.

`py.code`_: generate code and use advanced introspection/traceback support. 

`py.path`_: use path objects to transparently access local and svn filesystems.

Other (minor) support functionality 
===================================

`py lib scripts`_ to make python development easier. 

`py.xml`_ for generating in-memory xml/html object trees 

`py.io`_: Helper Classes for Capturing of Input/Output 

`py.log`_: an alpha document about the ad-hoc logging facilities 

`miscellaneous features`_ describes some small but nice py lib features.
