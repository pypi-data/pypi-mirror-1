History of plonehrm.absence
===========================

1.0.1 (2009-06-09)
------------------

- Allow adding an absence for tomorrow.  [maurits]

- The checklist items created by absence notes now contain a link to
  create a new Note in the current absence. [vincent]


1.0 (2009-06-04)
----------------

- Added EvaluationInterview to the factory types.  [maurits]


1.0rc1 (2009-06-02)
-------------------

- Removed the setting of the viewlets in the plonehrm_properties to
  the setuphandlers in Products.plonehrm, where we only set the order
  once.  [maurits+markvl]


1.0b5 (2009-05-29)
------------------

- days_absent now available in absentlist. [mike]

- In content.absence added a check to days_absent so if there is no
  contract the default value is 5 days per week the employee is working
  else if the employee is filled in to be absent there is no contract
  (so no days in a week) so you get a bug.[mike]


1.0b4 (2009-05-26)
------------------

- Added a second date field to the Note type. This field is used to
  define if a new call has to be given to the employee. A new event
  handler is fired when a note is created or updated. This event adds
  an item in the employee checklist to remind the next call
  date. [vincent]

- Changed columns name in absence view. Now 'Creator'/'Creation date'
  are 'Added by'/'Added on'. [vincent+fred]

- Added an 'edit' link in front of each absence in the absences
  viewlets. The edit button is only displayed in front of the current
  absence. [vincent]

- Updated form for closing absence. Now this form does not allow to
  change the title of the absence, but only displays
  it. [vincent+mark]

- Removed 'description' field from absence edit view. [vincent]

- Info box in absence view changed. If the absence shown is the
  current one (the employee is still sick) it displays the reason in
  red (CSS class 'absencetext'), the start date and the number of days
  the employee has been sick.
  If the absence is closed, the reason is shown without style and
  infos displayed are start/end date. A property
  'is_current_absence' has been added to the Absence class. The
  'days_absent' property has been corrected to add one day to the
  total. [vincent]

- Absence view now shows description for notes instead of the
  title. [vincent]

- Content of cells from the 'Created by' and 'Created' columns are now
  displayed with  the "discreet" CSS class. [vincent]

- Reversed order of elements displayed in absence view. Now the
  most recents items appears first. [vincent]

- Added a nice box with some details about the absence.
  [maurits+vincent]

- Added AbsenceFile content type, which is the same as ATFile, except
  for an extra date, and a different name.  [maurits+vincent]

- Added EvaluationInterview content type, which is only defined in
  GenericSetup as it is exactly the same as a Job Performance
  Interview, except for the name.  [maurits+vincent]

- Added main_date as alias for noteDate in the Note content type.
  (This will be used in other content types later.)  Added main_date
  as metadata and index to the portal_catalog on reinstall.  Sort on
  this date in the absence view.  [maurits+vincent]

- Added content type Note, which can be added within an Absence.
  [maurits+vincent]

- Removed the registering of javascript and css for the calendar.
  This was needed for having this available when adding an absence
  through kss.  But this prevented the calendar on edit forms from
  working.  So we will load this css and javascript explicitly in the
  employee page template (see Products.plonehrm).
  [maurits]

- Refactored absences into an Archetypes folderish content type.
