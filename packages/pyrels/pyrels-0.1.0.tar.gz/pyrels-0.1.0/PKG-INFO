Description: `Pyrels` is a tool for exploring and visualizing relationships between
        Python objects. It does so by analysing and converting Python namespaces
        into `GraphViz <http://www.graphviz.org>`_ files in the
        `DOT <http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html>`_ format.
        That means it displays relationships like references between Python names
        and the objects they point to, as well as containment between Python
        container objects (lists, tuples and dictionaries) and the respective
        objects they contain.
        
        At the moment `pyrels` is best used on Python data structures, but it is
        intended to develop it further so that it can also display other types of  relationships like inheritance, module imports, etc.
        
        One target group for `pyrels` are article and/or book authors who wish to
        illustrate Python data structures graphically without spending a lot of
        time for creating these illustrations manually. `Pyrels` can help you
        automate this process.
