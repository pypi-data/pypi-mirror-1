Changelog for collective.editskinswitcher
=========================================

(name of developer listed in brackets)

collective.editskinswitcher - 0.6 (Released 27 August 2008)
-----------------------------------------------------------

- New preview feature so that the default skin can be seen via the
  edit skin interface to preserve some level of WYSIWYG for editing.
  (Based on part of an unreleased plone 2 product by Dominic Hiles.)
  Preview feature is available as a viewlet for use via a view or a
  viewletManager, but it is turned off by default.  Examples of how to
  enable it are included in the tests, where it is enabled and tested.

- Extra URL skin switching options of SSL or specific URLs

- Setting eol style in subversion correctly. [reinout]


collective.editskinswitcher - 0.5 (Released 7 March 2008)
---------------------------------------------------------

- Bug fix: when called on the zope root (can happen in some cases)
  portal_properties was not found, which was not caught correctly.

collective.editskinswitcher - 0.4 (Released 12 February 2008)
-------------------------------------------------------------

- Bug fix: if object has no changeSkin, try its context.  Happens at
  least on the sharing tab when searching for users, as object is a
  KSS view then.

collective.editskinswitcher - 0.3 (Released 30 January 2008)
------------------------------------------------------------

- Instead of an Access Rule, use a pre-traversal hook.  Idea: David
  Convent.  Thanks!  Is a lot cleaner.
  [maurits]

- Avoid confusion in README.txt: talk about Editor Skin and Visitor
  Skin instead of Plone Default and the default skin.
  [maurits]

- Update README.txt to tell about the new options introduced in
  version 0.2.

collective.editskinswitcher - 0.2 (Released 28 January 2008)
------------------------------------------------------------

- When testing if the user is logged in, check for the __ac cookie in
  the request instead of portal_membership.isAnonymousUser as this
  does not work in real life; probably because we use an AccessRule.
  [maurits]

- Add based_on_url property (default: True).  When True, the skin
  switching is done when you visit the site via an edit url.  When
  combined with need_authentication=True, only logged-in users on the
  edit url get the edit skin.
  [maurits]

- Add need_authentication property (default: False).  When True, the
  skin switching is only done when you are authenticated (logged in).
  [maurits]

- In the base test cases, create the new default skin.
  [maurits]

- Split tests/setup.txt in two files for separating some unrelated
  tests.
  [maurits]

- Add a more readable README.txt and move the old one into the
  tests directory as it contains most of our tests.
  [maurits]


collective.editskinswitcher - 0.1 (Released 25 January 2008)
------------------------------------------------------------

- Add a property sheet editskin_switcher with property edit_skin.
  Default value: Plone Default.  Use that for determining which
  skin to give to editors.
  [maurits]

- Initial package structure.
