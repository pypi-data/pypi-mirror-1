Description: ILRT Content Migrator
        =====================
        
        Ed Crewe, `ILRT
        <http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/>`_ at University of Bristol, July 2009
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        This egg and the companion Product it contains was written to migrate content
        from pre-Archetypes plone 2.0 sites (or later) to current plone.
        
        The ilrt.contentmigrator egg extends the generic setup content import system
        to handle binary files and custom content. Hence a fully populated
        site can be generated from file system content held in a profiles structure
        folder.
        
        The egg follows the paradigm of the existing generic setup, but adds workflow
        state to the properties metadata.
        It also adds *.*.ini files for each binary content item so that these can
        have all their associated metadata imported and exported.
        
        It contains a companion old-style plone product. This can be dropped into the
        Products folder in an old plone site.
        The site gains a portal_exportcontent tool. Running the export from this
        tool exports the content to a structure folder in the var directory ready
        for using to populate a current plone site, and hence migrate the content.
        
        Concept
        -------
        
        The code was arrived at due to the need to migrate a large number of obselete
        plone sites and having researched the issue, found that most tools assumed a plone
        version within the last few years, where Archetypes, Five, Marshall and XML, or in
        place content migration is viable.
        
        Instead the code applies the methodology discussed in Andreas Jungs' blog posting
        `Plone migration fails - doing content-migration only
        <http://www.zopyx.com/blog/when-the-plone-migration-fails-doing-content-migration-only>`_
        
        Using the Content Migrator
        --------------------------
        
        Copy ilrt.contentmigrator/Products/ContentMigrator to the Products directory of
        the old plone site. Restart and you should have a 'Content Migrator Tool' listed
        in the right hand content drop down. Pick this and add it to the portal.
        
        There will be a new portal_exportcontent tool in your site. Select this and choose
        the Export content tab.
        Click export and wait whilst you site becomes files in var/zope/structure
        If you only wish to export a subsection of your site then specify the path in the
        textbox at the top of the page.
        
        Go to your new plone install. Add ilrt.contentmigrator to your buildout config
        and run bin/buildout.
        
        Copy (or symlink) the exported structure folder to a profile folder either in the
        ilrt.contentmigrator egg or in the main theme egg for your new plone site
        and restart, eg. ilrt.contentmigrator/ilrt/contentmigrator/profiles/import/structure
        
        If a default profile is used then generic setup will automatically create
        the content when the egg with the profile is reinstalled or selected for Plone site
        creation. Where as if another profile is used (such as /import above) then it has to
        be manually selected first and then run via the setup tool or this migrator tool.
        For large content imports this is likely to be preferable.
        
        Standard generic setup runs the adapter in CMFCore.exportimport.content which will
        only populate content for HTML documents, and no properties or workflow states will
        be added.
        
        To do a full import you must first install ilrt.contentmigrator via the quick installer.
        The content adapter for generic setup will be modified so that the content import step
        will now add all content and set workflow states.
        However if you go to the new portal_setupcontent tool you can run a further enhanced
        version of the generic setup content step that also sets up users, groups and
        memberdata and provides fuller logging to screen.
        In addition the tool provides access to the exporter so that you can re-export a site
        or a subfolder of its content.
        
        The ilrt.contentmigrator modifies the generic setup site creation to do the following
        
        - Populate binary content formats and archetypes if matching ones are found.
        - Use Marshall's RFC822 marshaller to extract and apply the properties data.
        - Apply workflow state transitions.
        NB: The workflow migration requires the
        `ilrt.migrationtool
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ilrt.migrationtool>`_ egg.
        - Translate old content types and add memberdata (see below)
        
        Please not that the import is takes much longer than the export.
        So for example a Gigabyte of content might only take 5 minutes to export, but take
        an hour to import!
        
        Old Types Translation
        ---------------------
        
        There is a mapping of old types to newer archetypes for old plone sites.
        Currently this just handles 'Calendar Item' to 'Event'.
        
        User migration
        --------------
        
        The contentmigrator will also export and import zope held users, including passwords.
        It does so by generating the user, roles and groups data from GRUF or
        PAS based sites as generic setup xml files in the /structure/acl_users folder.
        Memberdata is saved as a csv file for each member in the portal_memberdata directory
        within acl_users.

        TO DO
        -----
        
        - Add ATReference handling for export / import like GSXML
        - Fix AT file field handling to work if object also has default file data attribute
        - Add portrait handling to memberdata export / import
        - More old plone type translations?
        - Adapt to use for old zope only based content, eg. add html filters to grab
        the body text from ZPT content.
