0.5 (2009-08-06)

  - Fixed signatures of getc/putc callbacks in monitor that were broken
    when the ObservableMemory interface changed in 0.3.  Closes #1.

  - Fixed that ROL would not properly set the Z flag.  Closes #2.

0.4 (2009-06-06)

  - Added ez_setup.py to bootstrap setuptools installation.

0.3 (2009-06-03)

  - Added shortcuts for monitor commands such as "m" for "memory".  These
    are mostly the same as the VICE monitor shortcuts.

  - The terminal width can now be changed in the monitor using the new
    "width" command.  Some commands, like "mem", will wrap to this width.

  - Fixed a bug where BRK would increment PC by 3 instead of 2.  Thanks
    to Oscar Lindberg.

  - Added a new 65C02 MPU simulation started by Oscar Lindberg.  It is
    now mostly complete.
    
  - Added a new "mpu" command to the monitor.  It will switch between the
    NMOS 6502 and CMOS 65C02 simulations.

  - A new "devices" module has been added to organize device simulations.

  - The mpu6502 and mpu65c02 devices have been reorganized internally to
    use Python decorators to build their lookup tables based on an
    idea by Oscar Lindberg.

  - A new "utils" module has been added with various utility functions.

  - The ObservableMemory interface has been changed for clarity.

  - Python 2.4 or later is now required.

0.2 (2008-11-09)

  - Added a new "disassemble" command to the monitor.  It can disassemble
    any range of memory ("disassemble c000:c010").  If labels have been
    defined, the disassembly will show them in the operands.

  - Added a new "assemble" command to the monitor.  It can assemble a 
    single instruction at an address ("assemble c000 jsr $ffd2").  
    Labels in the operands are also supported ("assemble c000 jsr charout").

  - Moved the character I/O area from $E000 to $F000 for compatibility with
    the EhBASIC binary saved from Michal Kowalski's Windows-based simulator.  
    In a future version of Py65, the I/O area will be configurable.

  - When running a program in the monitor, a read to $F004 will now do a
    non-blocking read from STDIN.  If no character is available, a null
    byte ($00) will be returned.

  - Fixed a bug where a CMP instruction could crash the simulator due to 
    an undefined variable.

  - EhBASIC 2.09 now runs in the simulator!

  - Documented all remaining monitor commands.  In the monitor, use the
    command "help command" for help on any command.

0.1 (2008-11-21)

  - First release.
