  - Added a new "disassemble" command to the monitor.  It can disassemble
    any range of memory ("disassemble c000:c010").  If labels have been
    defined, the disassembly will show them in the operands.

  - Added a new "assemble" command to the monitor.  It can assemble a 
    single instruction at an address ("assemble c000 jsr $ffd2").  
    Labels in the operands are also supported ("assemble c000 jsr charout").

  - Moved the character I/O area from $E000 to $F000 for compatibility with
    the EhBASIC binary saved from Michal Kowalski's Windows-based simulator.  
    In a future version of Py65, the I/O area will be configurable.

  - When running a program in the monitor, a read to $F004 will now do a
    non-blocking read from STDIN.  If no character is available, a null
    byte ($00) will be returned.

  - Fixed a bug where a CMP instruction could crash the simulator due to 
    an undefined variable.

  - EhBASIC 2.09 now runs in the simulator!

  - Documented all remaining monitor commands.  In the monitor, use the
    command "help command" for help on any command.
