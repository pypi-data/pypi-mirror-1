        * Fixed "title_widget" error which popped up if the theme was used with other themes/shared hosting
        
        1.0.3 - 1.0.4
        =============
        
        * Fixed the problem of all sites giving an error when Twinapex Theme was not installed. Was caused by missing

        1.0.2 - 1.0.3
        =============
        
        * Package was marked as Zip safe - didn't work
        
        1.0.1 - 1.0.2
        =============
        
        * Fixed missing : character in README.txt. The world should seriously consider reST validators.
        
        1.0 - 1.0.1
        ===========
        
        * Fixed packaking scripts and included missing files.
