YOU THERE
=========
Hello! Hello. You have embarked on a sensuous
journey, only to have it interrupted here ... at
The Brownstone.

The Brownstone is a thin, ridiculously unadorned
framework over Ian Bicking's WebOb library. Its
depenencies are encoded not in setup.py but the
requirements.txt file, with a -devel flavor for
developers and people with a penchant for risk ...
or documentation.
