Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Extra extension of the collective.blogging which integrates 3rd-party
        package Products.Maps for blogging events.
        
        Installing
        ============
        
        This package requires Plone 3.x or later (tested on 3.3.x).
        
        Installing without buildout
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Install this package in either your system path packages or in the lib/python
        directory of your Zope instance. You can do this using either easy_install or
        via the setup.py script.
        
        Installing with buildout
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If you are using `buildout`_ to manage your instance installing
        collective.bloggingmaps is even simpler. You can install
        collective.bloggingmaps by adding it to the eggs line for your instance::
        
        [instance]
        eggs = collective.bloggingmaps
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run the ''bin/buildout'', which
        will take care of updating your system.
        
        .. _buildout: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout
