Description: Sunburst, a theme for Plone 4
        =============================
        
        Sunburst is a modern, minimalist, grid-based theme for Plone 4.
        
        Goals:
        
        - Keep the theme color-neutral (black, white, grays), so it meshes with any
        company logo and doesn't feel like it requires color adjustment for doing the
        10-minute-show-it-to-the-boss exercise.
        
        - The theme does not use any tables for layout, and is based on the Deco grid
        approach which is currently in use on plone.org. It works perfectly in all
        browsers, including IE6.
        
        - The grid works in both fixed-width and flexible-width modes, there's a
        commented-out section in the top of the CSS file you can enable if you want
        fixed-width layout.
        
        - No substantial markup changes outside of the table removal - class and ID
        names are kept.
        
        - The theme uses some CSS3 features, but degrades gracefully.
        
        - The theme does not use any DTML.
        
        - When viewed on a device with less than 640px width, the portlets neatly tuck
        under the main content area. This means that the site works well with
        CSS-enabled devices like tablets and phones that may have limited resolution.
