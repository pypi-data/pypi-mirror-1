Remaining/known issues:

- Resolve the #content vs #region-content mess

- Add support for the jQuery Tools dialog for login + deletion once both these 
  PLIPs have been merged.

- Unify viewlet positions in plonetheme.classic and this theme, essentially add 
  pulldown support + bottom site actions to the classic theme once we have
  merged.

- Fix formlib forms to insert a div with class="formControls" on its submit
  buttons.

- When going to the Sharing form on the front page, it says "You are adjusting 
  the sharing privileges for a default view in a container. To adjust them for 
  the entire container, go here" — but there is no link to "here" :)

- Look in main_template for TODO markers; I'm hoping we can simplify or remove
  some of the more complex TAL expressions, or move them to views. 
  Help appreciated. :)

- Theme is not split up in multiple files yet — we'll probably do a simple 
  public/edit interface split to encourage reuse, but not as many files as Plone 
  3.

- Personal bar is missing Profile link, prefs should link directly to the
  preferences, not to the intermediate page.

- The plan is to get rid of most of the unnecessary icons (copy/paste, etc), and 
  possibly make the standard folder/page icons etc more color-neutral 
  (black & white is one option).

- The searchField/inputLabel JS should apply the type="search" dynamically using
  Martijn's script for this.

- The sortableTable script should insert the utf-8 characters for up/down
  instead of using images.

- Remove the "Subfolder" tab from Collections, "Contents" does the same thing.

- Figure out whether we can get rid of the prefs_main_template now; having a
  special main_template just for the pref panels shouldn't be necessary.

- Profile and dashboard pages are not styled yet, need to see if we can make
  these use the standard templates.

- Move code to views where possible, and move the KSS spinner to a viewlet or
  something.

Need more testing:

- IE6/7 should be functional now, but I haven't tested this personally yet — I
  trust Denys on these things, though. :)

- Limited RTL testing/updates done, need more eyes on this.

Known issues that are upstream bugs:

- The theme is using Dean Edwards' "ie8.js" to compensate for deficiencies in 
  IE6/7 CSS support. Currently, there's a bug in this script that applies the 
  mobile phone styling on IE6/7, but it's being looked into:
