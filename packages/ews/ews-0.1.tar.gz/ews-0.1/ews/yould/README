This is Yould 0.1, the generator for warm sounding words.

Yould is released under the GNU GPL, see COPYING for the details. 

Yould will generate a bunch of words that roughly sound plausible
according to English pronunciation rules.  You can also retrain Yould
for any language or mix of languages.  The most simple usage is to use
the provided transition table based on the King James Bible:

  ./yould.py kjb.prob 5 12 30 0

This will generate 30 words between 5 and 12 letters long without
checking for domain availability.  If you only want words with
available domains, replace the last 0 with a number between 1 and 4:
the number of free domains in .com, .net, .org and .info that you
want.

Yould will usually prefer short words.  If you are looking for long
words, don't hesitate to jack the minimum length.  Yould will print a
score when it finds a new word.  This score is more or less the
probability to generate the given word according to the transition
table.  The score is not statically correct and you can safely ignore
it.

To retrain Yould, you will need a relatively large body of text.
Project Gutenberg is a good place to find those:

   http://www.gutenberg.org/

With the provided dl-kjb.py script you can download the King James
Bible from Project Gutenberg.  If you prefer something else, perhaps
in another language just put the .txt of the ebooks in a directory
and run

  ./yould-train.py *.txt > foo.prob

You can now use foo.prob as a transition table for Yould.

That's it!
