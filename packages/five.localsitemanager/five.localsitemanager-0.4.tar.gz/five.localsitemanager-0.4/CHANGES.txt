Changelog
=========

0.4 - 2008-07-23
----------------

* Rewrite PersistentComponents.registeredUtilities to not use
  internal methods. This makes it compatible with both zope.component <3.5.0dev
  and >3.5.0dev.


0.3 - 2007-12-24
----------------

* Fixed potential aq problem when assigning various values to the utilities
  registry of the component registry.

0.2 - 2007-06-30
----------------

* Refactored and fixed aq wrapping: Nested site managers now return utilities
  wrapped in the right context. RequestContainers are removed and wrapped
  utilities are cached. This requires a special LookupClass called
  'FiveVerifyingAdapterLookup' in all 'utilities' registries used below a
  five.localsitemanager site.


0.1.2 - 2007-06-23
------------------

* Corrected the zip-safe flag to be False.


0.1.1 - 2007-03-05
------------------

* Fixed aq wrapping when looking up a utility that is actually the component
  registry's parent (the ISite).


0.1 (2007-02-27)
----------------

* Initial version
