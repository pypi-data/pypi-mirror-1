Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        five.localsitemanager attempts to provide a local site manager implementation
        that is as close to Zope 3's implemenation as possible.  Some reservations
        that do not conflict with Zope 3 have been made to easy the path with CMF.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.4 - 2008-07-23
        ----------------
        
        * Rewrite PersistentComponents.registeredUtilities to not use
        internal methods. This makes it compatible with both zope.component <3.5.0dev
        and >3.5.0dev.
        
        
        0.3 - 2007-12-24
        ----------------
        
        * Fixed potential aq problem when assigning various values to the utilities
        registry of the component registry.
        
        0.2 - 2007-06-30
        ----------------
        
        * Refactored and fixed aq wrapping: Nested site managers now return utilities
        wrapped in the right context. RequestContainers are removed and wrapped
        utilities are cached. This requires a special LookupClass called
        'FiveVerifyingAdapterLookup' in all 'utilities' registries used below a
        five.localsitemanager site.
        
        
        0.1.2 - 2007-06-23
        ------------------
        
        * Corrected the zip-safe flag to be False.
        
        
        0.1.1 - 2007-03-05
        ------------------
        
        * Fixed aq wrapping when looking up a utility that is actually the component
        registry's parent (the ISite).
        
        
        0.1 (2007-02-27)
        ----------------
        
        * Initial version
