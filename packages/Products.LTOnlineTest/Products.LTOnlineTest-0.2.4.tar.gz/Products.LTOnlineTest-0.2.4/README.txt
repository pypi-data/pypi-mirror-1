Products.LTOnlineTest
=====================

  LTOnlineTest (formerly known as CMFExam) is a project aimed at developing a
  fully featured online test (or quiz) product which works in both CMFDefault
  and Plone based sites.

  What is it?

      The aim with the first release has been to develop a product which
      delivers the minimum functionality to make it immediately useful.
      Further enhancements, along the lines of J.A.R. Williams' Exam product
      are planned for future releases.

  Where can it be used?

      The product was developed in Archetypes, and the product has been tested
      in both CMFDefault and Plone site (although due to Archetypes, some Plone
      tools have to be added to a CMFDefault site to get the product to work).

  Future plans

      The next stage of development will be the integration of most of the
      features of the aforementioned Exam product. First and foremost will be
      saving of results, then additional question types (multiple answer,
      numeric, etc).
