Description: This is a pure-Python XPath evaluator based on
        ElementTree. It supports a substantial fraction of the XPath 1.0
        specification, notwithstanding the limitation that only the self,
        child, and attribute axes are supported. The parser underlying the
        evaluator attempts to handle all of XPath 1.0.
