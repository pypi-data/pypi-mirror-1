0.4.1 (2008-12-31)
------------------

* plonify the paypal redirect page. [james4765]
* Add some more verbose logging, so we can track why some IPNs
  are not being recognized by the code
* Changed the response method from Paypal to POST so you don't
  have a huge, ugly URL coming back.
* Override /@@getpaid-thank-you so we can extract the order 
  number from the paypal POST response.
* clean up overrides - remove unneeded override code for the 
  cart actions viewlet, since we are overriding the entire 
  cart wizard view.
* fill in order data for shipping address, email, and name from
  the data returned from Paypal
* Initial IPN functionality working with paypal sandbox - need
  to wire it into the paypal purchase button to complete 
  round-tripping

* Add capability to choose currency in shopping cart code, and
  enable round-tripping back from paypal
* Allow TTW configuration of Paypal merchant ID and selection
