        0.4.1 (2008-12-31)
        ------------------
        
        * plonify the paypal redirect page. [james4765]
        * Add some more verbose logging, so we can track why some IPNs
        are not being recognized by the code
        * Changed the response method from Paypal to POST so you don't
        have a huge, ugly URL coming back.
        * Override /@@getpaid-thank-you so we can extract the order
        number from the paypal POST response.
        * clean up overrides - remove unneeded override code for the
        cart actions viewlet, since we are overriding the entire
        cart wizard view.
        * fill in order data for shipping address, email, and name from
        the data returned from Paypal
        * Initial IPN functionality working with paypal sandbox - need
        to wire it into the paypal purchase button to complete
        round-tripping
        * Add cart saving capability
        * Add capability to choose currency in shopping cart code, and
        enable round-tripping back from paypal
        * Allow TTW configuration of Paypal merchant ID and selection
        of sandbox or production site target
