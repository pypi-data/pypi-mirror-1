Description: collective.saoraclefixes
        ========================
        
        Fix SQLAlchemy 0.4 and 0.5 Oracle quoting and offset/limit problems.
        
        This package monkeypatches the SQLAlchemy Oracle driver with backports from
        the SQLAlchemy 0.6 branch. Fixes included are:
        
        - Reserved words. Before 0.6 no Oracle-specific reserved words were included,
        requiring you to rename columns and labels, making it difficult to code
        in a database-neutral fashion.
        
        Note that the oracle reserved words list in this package is a superset of
        the list in SQLAlchemy 0.6 (at least until SQLAlchemy branches/rel_0_6
        r6245). This package includes semi-reserved identifiers as defined by the
        `Oracle V$RESERVED_WORDS view`_
        
        - Bindparameter quoting. Using a reserved word as a bind parameter requires
        quoting as well. Parameters are quoted in the generated SQL code, and all
        use of the parameters during execution correctly uses the quoted versions.
        
        - Limit/offset handling. 0.6 introduces a (much) better method of implementing
        query limits and offsets in Oracle, following recommended Oracle practice.
        The 0.4/0.5 method could result in incorrect ordering, or would completely
        fail when sorting on a aliased column.
        
        The backport includes support for the optimize_limits=False dialect flag.
        For more information on the change, see `SQLAlchemy ticket #536`_.
        
        To use, simply add an import to this package::
        
        import collective.saoraclefixes # apply oracle fixes
        
        Note that the patches will only apply when SQLAlchemy versions 0.4 and 0.5 are
        used. All patching activity will be logged via python's logger module with
        loglevel DEBUG.
