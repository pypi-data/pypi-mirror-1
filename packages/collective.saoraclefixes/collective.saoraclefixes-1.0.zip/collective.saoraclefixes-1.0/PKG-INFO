Description: collective.saoraclefixes
        ========================
        
        Fix SQLAlchemy 0.4 and 0.5 Oracle quoting problems.
        
        Monkeypatches SQLAlchemy's Oracle driver to add Oracle reserved words, and
        to implement quoting of bindparameters. These fixes are a partial backport
        from the 0.6 release branch.
        
        To use, simply add an import to this package::
        
        import collective.saoraclefixes # apply oracle fixes
        
        Note that the patches will only apply when SQLAlchemy versions 0.4 and 0.5 are
        used. All patching activity will be logged via python's logger module with
        loglevel DEBUG.
        
        Note that the oracle reserved words list in this package is a superset of the
        list in SQLAlchemy 0.6 (at least until SQLAlchemy branches/rel_0_6 r6245).
        This package includes semi-reserved identifiers as defined by the `Oracle
        V$RESERVED_WORDS view`_
