1.2.0 (2009-01-22)
------------------

- Moved self-test from configure.zcml to tests.zcml to not automatically
  include them when zc.selenium is included.
- pytest's selenium coverts arguments to strings now. This allows calls like
  ``self.selenium.pause(500)``.

1.1.0 (2009-01-19)
------------------

- Feature: Updated to the latest Selenium Core release 0.8.3.

- Feature: Added a `--base-url` option to the selenium script, so that one is
  not dependent to include the default layer in the default skin. (Who does
  this? What a security hole!)

- Feature: Added a `-t` option to filter selenium tests by regexps.  You can
  also specify multiple `-t` options.

- Bug: Added documentation on how to setup `zc.selenium`.

- Bug: Allow wsgi option to work with python 2.5

- First public release.

1.0.0 (2008-03-27)
------------------

- Internal release.
