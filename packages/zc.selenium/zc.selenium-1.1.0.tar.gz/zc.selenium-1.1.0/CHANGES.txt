1.1.0 (2009-01-19)
------------------

- Feature: Updated to the latest Selenium Core release 0.8.3.

- Feature: Added a `--base-url` option to the selenium script, so that one is
  not dependent to include the default layer in the default skin. (Who does
  this? What a security hole!)

- Feature: Added a `-t` option to filter selenium tests by regexps.  You can
  also specify multiple `-t` options.

- Bug: Added documentation on how to setup `zc.selenium`.
