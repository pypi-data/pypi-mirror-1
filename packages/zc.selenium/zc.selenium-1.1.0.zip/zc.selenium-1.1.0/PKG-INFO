Description: ===========================
        Selenium testing for Zope 3
        ===========================
        
        This package provides an easy way to use Selenium tests for Zope 3
        applications.  It provides Selenium itself as a resource directory,
        and it provides a test suite listing generated from registered views,
        allowing different packages to provide tests without a central list of
        tests to be maintained.
        
        Selenium test views can also be written in Python using the
        `zc.selenium.pytest` module.  This can make tests substantially easier
        to write.
        
        The file pytest.txt explains how to write tests using the Python format.
        
        The package also provides a test runner that:
        
        - Runs a Zope instance
        
        - Starts a local browser, if necessary,
        
        - Tells the local browser to run the tests.
        
        See selenium.txt to see how to set up and use the test runner.
        
        Selenium Issues
        ---------------
        
        There is a known issue in the included version of Selenium; this
        affects clicking on images in MSIE.  The Selenium bug report for this
        problem is here:
        
        http://jira.openqa.org/browse/SRC-99
        
        A patch in the file is provided in the file:
        
        Selenium-Core-SRC-99.patch
        
        It is not known whether this patch should always be applied.

        =======
        
        
        1.1.0 (2009-01-19)
        ------------------
        
        - Feature: Updated to the latest Selenium Core release 0.8.3.
        
        - Feature: Added a `--base-url` option to the selenium script, so that one is
        not dependent to include the default layer in the default skin. (Who does
        this? What a security hole!)
        
        - Feature: Added a `-t` option to filter selenium tests by regexps.  You can
        also specify multiple `-t` options.
        
        - Bug: Added documentation on how to setup `zc.selenium`.
        
        - Bug: Allow wsgi option to work with python 2.5
        
        - First public release.
