Description: Python 2.5's contextlib provides some handy functions for dealing with context managers, but it's pretty limited. The code in context_tools allows you to use context managers as decorators, as setUp and tearDown functions in unittest tests, and as decorators for generators.
        
        In addition to Python 2.5 and 3.0, context_tools is available for Python 2.4.
