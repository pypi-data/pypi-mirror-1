Compatibility with ZODB `versions`
==================================

ZEORaid is not compatible with ZODB's `version` feature as it is deprecated
and actively being removed.

ZEORaid has API-compatibility with those releases of the ZODB that provide and
use versions but will actively prevent any usage of the version features.
