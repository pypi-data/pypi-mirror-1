3.9.0a1 (2008-??-??)
====================

New Features
------------

- Versions are no-longer supported.

- ZEO cache files can be larger than 4G. Note that older ZEO cache
  files are not supported.

- Document conflict resolution (see ZODB/ConflictResolution.txt).

- Support multidatabase references in conflict resolution.

- Make it possible to examine oid and (in some situations) database
  name of persistent object references during conflict resolution.

- Moved 'transaction' module out of ZODB.
  ZODB depends upon this module, but it must be installed separately.

- ZODB installation now requires setuptools.

- Added `offset` information to output of `fstail`
  script. Added test harness for this script.

- Added support for read-only, historical connections based
  on datetimes or serials (TIDs).  See
  src/ZODB/historical_connections.txt.

Bugs Fixed
----------

- Fix for bug #181712: Make ClientStorage update `lastTransaction` directly
  after connecting to a server, even when no cache verification is necessary.

- Fixed bug in blob filesystem helper: the `isSecure` check was inversed.

- Fixed bug in transaction buffer: a tuple was unpacked incorrectly in
  `clear`.

- Bugfix the situation in which comparing persistent objects (for
  instance, as members in BTree set or keys of BTree) might cause data
  inconsistency during conflict resolution.

- Fixed bug 153316: persistent and BTrees were using `int`
  for memory sizes which caused errors on x86_64 Intel Xeon machines
  (using 64-bit Linux).
  
- Fixed small bug that the Connection.isReadOnly method didn't
  work after a savepoint.

- Bug #98275: Made ZEO cache more tolerant when invalidating current
  versions of objects.

- Fixed a serious bug that could cause client I/O to stop
  (hang). This was accomonied by a critical log message along the
  lines of: "RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration".

- Fixed bug #127182: Blobs were subclassable which was not desired.

- Fixed bug #126007: tpc_abort had untested code path that was
  broken.

- Fixed bug #129921: getSize() function in BlobStorage could not
  deal with garbage files

- Fixed bug in which MVCC would not work for blobs.

- Fixed bug in ClientCache that occurred with objects larger than the total
  cache size.
