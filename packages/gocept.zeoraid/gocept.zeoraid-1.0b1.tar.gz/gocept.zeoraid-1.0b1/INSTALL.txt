==================
Installing ZEORaid
==================

Note: These are preliminary instructions for installing the test releases for
ZEORaid. The actual deployment mechanisms are not yet in place and will be
documented in this file in the future.


Quick installation
==================

This installation procedure will install a ZEORaid server connected to 2 local ZEO
servers.

You can tweak the settings in `parts/*` to 

1. Check out the ZEORaid code and buildout:

  $ svn co svn://svn.zope.org/repos/main/gocept.zeoraid/tags/1.0a1 gocept.zeoraid

2. Copy the `buildout.cfg.example` file to `buildout.cfg`:

  $ cp buildout.cfg.example buildout.cfg

3. Bootstrap and run the buildout with Python 2.4:

  $ python2.4 bootstrap.py
  $ bin/buildout

4. Start the servers:

  $ bin/server1 start
  $ bin/server2 start
  $ bin/zeoraid start

Run the tests
=============

You might want to run the test suite to make sure that ZEORaid works as
expected on your platform:

  $ bin/test -vv --all

If you see *any* test failures please report them as bugs.


Reporting bugs
==============

The bug tracker lives at http://bugs.launchpad.net/gocept.zeoraid

Please file bugs there and provide tracebacks.


Customizing your configuration
==============================

The parts directory contains the configuration for ZEORaid and the two ZEO
servers. Those appear like normal ZEO server configurations and can be tweaked
by you to experiment with different settings.

Note that those settings are overridden when re-running buildout.

If you want to connect ZEORaid to existing ZEO servers, please remember:

 - ZEORaid needs the `gocept-iteration` branch to run on both the ZEORaid
   server and the backend ZEO servers. This branch will be merged to the trunk
   after completion and review and should be available in the final ZODB 3.9
   release.

 - Keep backups of your data. ZEORaid has good unit test coverage but hasn't
   seen live action yet, so keep this in mind.


Accessing the management script
===============================

The management script is still a bit rough. Here's how you call it:

  $ bin/client src/gocept/zeoraid/manage.py <command> [args]

The available commands are:

  details
  status
  disable [storage]
  recover [storage]

The script currently always expects ZEORaid to run on localhost:8100.
