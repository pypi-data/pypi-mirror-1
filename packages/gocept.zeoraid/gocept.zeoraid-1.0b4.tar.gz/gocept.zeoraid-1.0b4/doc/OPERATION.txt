Packing
=======

ZODBs packing operation ist commutative with the operation of appending
transactions, so that for a series of transactions X and a point in time T the
following holds:

pack(T) + append(X) == append(X) + pack(T)

Due to this you are free to pack storages any way you want:

- via zeopack to a zeoraid server
- via zeopack to each of the backend storages
- via pack on your application server

We do *recommend* to pack them shortly after each other to avoid application
errors WRT historical data. (Those won't be database errors but your
application will fail to undo or retrieve historical data reliably.)
