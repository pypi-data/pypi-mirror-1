Change History
==============

1.0b4 (2009-11-13)
------------------

- Always format TIDs in recovery status.

- Remove use of custom exceptions: RAIDErrors were pickled and send to the
  client which didn't have ZEORaid installed causing unpickling errors.

- Fix issue when storing blogs in shared mode: tpc_vote returned the serials
  of the first store twice causing spurious RAID inconsistency errors.

- Close degraded storages when registering them as degraded in __init__ by
  calling the appropriate degradation method.

- Make recovery more robust against storages that fail to open (a storage
  failing to open caused the ZEORaid server recovery to hang).

- Hack for processing ZEO server's waiting list which doesn't expect storages
  to be used by someone else in the same process (covered with test). This
  caused clients to stochastically hang indefinitely when committing while a
  recovery was in progress.

- Refactor some sloppy tests.

- Some code cleanups.

1.0b3 (2009-07-19)
------------------

- Fix another recovery issue by using the correct previous Tid of a data
  record.

  Improve logging during recovery.

- Show current recovery process in the management `details` command.

- Fix recipe test to not mention the removed ZODB external anymore.

- Don't require the ZEO configuration file to be named again, determine
  automatically.

1.0b2 (2009-07-02)
------------------

- Fixed recovery issue that left `lastTid` in the wrong state for
  ClientStorages by using `store` instead of `restore`.

- Improved tests at various points.

- Added capability to reload ZEO configuration online.
  (Thanks to Dirceu Pereira Tiegs)

- Documentation improvements.

- Changed the recipe's name pattern for management client scripts to
  <partname>-<storagename>-manage.

- Fixed accidentally commented out assertion that only allows storages with
  undo support to be used in ZEORaid.

1.0b1 (2008-04-30)
------------------

- Finished management utility as setuptools `console_script`.

- Added deployment documentation.

- Added buildout recipe for installing ZEO servers with ZEORaid egg and the
  management utility.

- Added and documented blob support.

- Fixed online recovery.

- Added read-only flag to ZConfig schema.

- Better test coverage.
