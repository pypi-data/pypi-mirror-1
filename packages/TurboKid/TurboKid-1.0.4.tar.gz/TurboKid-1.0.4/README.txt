TurboKid
========

This package provides a template engine plugin, allowing you
to easily use Kid with TurboGears, Buffet or other systems
that support python.templating.engines.

There are plans to integrate this functionality into Kid,
so this package may eventually become superfluous.

Kid templates are assumed to have a "kid" extension.

For information on the Kid templating engine, go here:

Kid is the standard templating engine for TurboGears 1.0, so
