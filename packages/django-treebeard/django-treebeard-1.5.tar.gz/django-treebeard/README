   
django-treebeard
================

django-treebeard is a library that implements efficient tree
implementations for the Django Web Framework 1.0+. It includes 3 different
tree implementations: Adjacency List, Materialized Path and Nested Sets.
Each one has it's own strength and weaknesses but share the same
API, so it's easy to switch between implementations.

django-treebeard uses Django Model Inheritance with abstract classes
to let you define your own models. To use django-treebeard:

   1. Download a release from the treebeard download page or get a
      development version from the treebeard mercurial repository.
   2. Run python setup.py install
   3. Add 'treebeard' to the INSTALLED_APPS section in your django
      settings file.
   4. Create a new model that inherits from one of django-treebeard's
      abstract tree models: mp_tree.MP_Node (materialized path),
      ns_tree.NS_Node (nested sets) or al_tree.AL_Node (adjacency list).
   5. Run python manage.py syncdb
