Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This is a wrapper for the Anobii APIs.
        see: http://api.anobii.com/api/api_home.php
        
        My approach is so similar to the one used by flickrApi that I get his code from
        http://flickrapi.sf.net/
        and I adapted it to Anobii API.
        thanks to Sybren Stuvel for his work.
        
        This product uses the aNobii API but is not endorsed or certified by aNobii.
        
        How to use it
        =============
        
        It's quite easy. first of all istance the AnobiiApi passing key and secret:
        
        >>> a = anobii.api.AnobiiAPI(key, secret)
        
        then call the api you need. for example to call the anobii.shelf.getSimpleShelf('user', 'limit')
        you can call:
        
        >>> a.shelf_getSimpleShelf(user_id='massimoazzolini', limit='3')
        
        note that "anobii" disappears (a is anobii..) and "shelf." is replaced by "shelf_".
        that's it.
