        0.4 (2009-06-24)
        ----------------
        
        - 100% test coverage.
        
        - Allow ``add`` method to accept arbitrary keyword arguments.  These
        keyword arguments are now passed as ``**kw`` to transition functions
        as well as ``before_transition`` and ``after_transition``.  This
        allows arbitrary metadata (such as security and UI information) to
        be associated with a transition.
        
        - The ``transitions`` method now returns all transitions, including
        "catch-all" transitions (transitions with a transition_id of None).
        
        - Add ``transition_info`` method to state machine, which
        
        0.3 (2009-04-10)
        ----------------
        
        - Removed mutable default arguments, to avoid polluting one state machine's
        states when adding to another.
        
        0.2 (2009-02-20)
        ----------------
        
        - Initial release. Updated README.txt and removed remnants from repoze
        package template.
