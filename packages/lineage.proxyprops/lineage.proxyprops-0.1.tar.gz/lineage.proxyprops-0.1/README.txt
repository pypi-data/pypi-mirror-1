Introduction
============

This package listens for a IChildSiteCreation event and then adds a `Proxy Properties <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.proxyproperties>`_ local utility to that child site.

This package along with the Proxy Properties package are proof of concepts and are subject to re-writes :)
