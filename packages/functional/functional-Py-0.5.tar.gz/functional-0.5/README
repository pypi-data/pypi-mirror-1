### Introduction

functional provides Python users with numerous
tools common in functional programming, such as foldl, foldr, flip, as well
as mechanisms for partial function application and function composition.

functional comes in two flavours: one is written in a combination of C and
Python, focusing on performance. The second is written in pure Python and
emphasises code readability and portability. The pure-Python variant is also
recommended if your setup does not allow compilation of third-party extension
modules.

### Installation

From source:
	1. Untar the .tar.gz file
	2. cd into the resulting directory
	3. python setup.py install (you may need to be root for this)
	
From a Python egg:
	1. easy_install.py functional-x.y-py2.4.egg
    
    or, depending on your setup
    
    1. easy_install functional-x.y-py2.4.egg
