Description: functional provides a pure-python implementation of the C-language `functional` module that will be included in Python 2.5.
        
        While the module to be shipped with python is implemented in C for speed, we've opted to rewrite this version in Python to make it more portable and easier to read.
        
        This module will be kept 100% in sync with the capabilities offered by the C implementation. As such, the official documentation from python.org serves to document this module as well.
        
        Currently offered: partial, a class for implementing partial function application; foldl and foldr, two functions for reducing an iterable to a single value
Keywords: python functional partial foldl foldr higher-order
