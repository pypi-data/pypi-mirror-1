### Introduction

functional provides a pure-python implementation of the C-language
`functional` module that will be included in Python 2.5.
	
While the module to be shipped with python is implemented in C for speed,
we've opted to rewrite this version in Python to make it more portable and
easier to read.

This module will be kept 100% in sync with the capabilities offered by the C
implementation. As such, the official documentation from python.org serves to
document both the C and python versions.

Currently offered: partial, a class for implementing partial function
application; foldl and foldr, two functions for reducing an iterable to a
single value.
