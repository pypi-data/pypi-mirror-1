        Zope 3 Checkout Recipe
        **********************
        
        Recipe for creating a Zope 3 checkout in a buildout.
        
        Hopefully, when Zope is packaged as eggs, this won't be necessary.
        
        The recipe has two options:
        
        url
        The Subversion URL to use to checkout Zope. For example, to get the 3.3
        branch, use:
        
        url = svn://svn.zope.org/repos/main/branches/3.3
        
        This option is required.
        
        revision
        The revision to check out. This is optional and defaults to "HEAD".
        
        The checkout is installed into a subdirectory of the buildout parts
        directory whose name is the part name used for the recipe.
        
        This location is recorded in a 'location' option within the section
        that other recipes can query to get the location.
