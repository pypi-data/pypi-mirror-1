Description: Zope 3 Checkout
        ===============
        
        Recipe for creating a Zope 3 checkout in a buildout.
        
        Hopefully, when Zope is packages as eggs, this won't be necessary.
        
        The recipe has a single option, which is the Sunbersion URL to use to
        checkout Zope.  For example, to get the 3.3 branch, use:
        
        url = svn://svn.zope.org/repos/main/branches/3.3
        
        The checkout is installed into a subdirectory of the buildout parts
        directory whos name is the part named used for the recipe.
        
        This location is recorded in a 'location' option within the section
        that other recipes can query to get the location.
