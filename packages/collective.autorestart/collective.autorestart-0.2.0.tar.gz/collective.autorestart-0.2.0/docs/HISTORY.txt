Changelog
=========

0.1.1 - 0.2
-----------

* Fixed deadlock problems (I think). pyinotify 0.8.x was using timeoutless blocking calls by default and they prevented
  singnals propagade properly. Wrapped Zope signal handlers so that they close pyinotify before trying exit the system.
 
* Added deadlock debugger to address the issue above

* Thread/reload logic should be smarted and the reload is always in the background thread 

* Use __init__.py file to detect Python modules instead of scanning all folders

* Added signal handler and threaddump support
