To install, just run:

	sudo python setup.py install
	
	or
	
	sudo easy_install gdm2setup
	
The app will install the libraries and create a Gnome menu item as well.

Requirements:  GDM2, Python 2.4+, GTK, PIL (Python Imaging Library)
All of which are pretty much standard on any Ubuntu or Debian system.
NOTE: this application no longer requires ImageMagic.
