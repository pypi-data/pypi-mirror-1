        DESCRIPTION:
        
        A simple setup for GDM2, now that Ubuntu seems to be missing this
        functionality due to omissions within the newer Gnome version included in
        Karmic Ubuntu and others. GDM2Setup allows for wallpaper setting,
        autologin, prompted or userlist login, etc. This application's goal is to put the
        older GDM functionality back in the hands of the users.
        
        REQUIREMENTS:
        
        This application requires PIL (python-imaging), GDM2, Python 2.4+, and GTK.
        All of which are pretty much standard on any Ubuntu or Debian system.
        
        NOTE: this application no longer requires ImageMagic.
        
        This app must be run with root privilages (use sudo).
        
        INSTALLATION:
        
        For installation, please see the INSTALL file.
