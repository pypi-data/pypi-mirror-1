TODO
====

- Add tests for zcml ``package="another.import"`` detection.

- Improve test coverage.

- Try it on more projects and gather feedback.

- Add some extra fallbacks for often-used packages like PIL (which is really
  Imaging when you import it).

- Optionally check imports inside doctests.

- Optionally report separately on dependencies that should be moved from the
  regular to the test dependencies.
