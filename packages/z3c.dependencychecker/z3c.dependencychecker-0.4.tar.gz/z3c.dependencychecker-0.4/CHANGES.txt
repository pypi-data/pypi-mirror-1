==================================

0.4 (2009-12-10)
----------------

- Supporting "from zope import interface"-style imports where you really want
  to be told you're missing an "zope.interface" dependency instead of just
  "zope" (which is just a namespace package).

----------------

- Sorted "unneeded requirements" reports and filtered out duplicates.

- Reporting separately on dependencies that should be moved from the regular
  to the test dependencies.

----------------

- Added tests.  Initial quick test puts coverage at 86%.

- Fixed bug in test requirement detection.

- Added documentation.

- Moved source code to zope's svn repository.


0.1 (2009-12-02)
----------------

- Also reporting on unneeded imports.

- Added note on re-running buildout after a setup.py change.
