Changes
=======

0.2 (2009-02-23)

- register the widget for IChoice fields with an ISearchableSource.
  This functionality depends on z3c.form>=r96460 (will be included in
  z3c.form-2.0).
- improved documentation.

0.1 (2009-02-06)
----------------

- first release
- NOTE: still missing security declarations on the autocomplete-search view.
  This means anyone can query the source for values.
