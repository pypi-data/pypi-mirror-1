        Network programs are typically difficult to test because they require
        setting up network connections, clients, and servers.  In addition,
        application code gets mixed up with networking code.
        
        The Network Gateway Interface (NGI) seeks to improve this situation by
        separating application code from network code.  This allows
        application and network code to be tested independently and provides
        greater separation of concerns.

        Changes
        *******
        
        ==================
        1.1.4 (2009-10-28)
        ==================
        
        Bug fixed:
        
        - Spurious warnings sometimes occurred due to a race condition in
        setting up servers.
        - Added missing "writelines" method to zc.ngi.adapters.Lines.
        
        ==================
        1.1.3 (2009-07-30)
        ==================
        
        Bug fixed:
        
        - zc.ngi.async bind failures weren't handled properly, causing lots of
        annoying log messages to get spewed, which tesnded to fill up log
        files.
        
        ==================
        1.1.2 (2009-07-02)
        ==================
        
        Bugs fixed:
        
        - The zc.ngi.async thread wasn't named. All threads should be named.
        
        ==================
        1.1.1 (2009-06-29)
        ==================
        
        Bugs fixed:
        
        - zc.ngi.blocking didn't properly handle connection failures.
        
        ==================
        1.1.0 (2009-05-26)
        ==================
        
        Bugs fixed:
        
        - Blocking input and output files didn't properly synchronize closing.
        
        - The testing implementation made muiltiple simultaneous calls to
        handler methods in violation of the promise made in interfaces.py.
        
        - Async TCP servers used too low a listen depth, causing performance
        issues and spurious test failures.
        
        New features:
        
        - Added UDP support.
        
        - Implementation responsibilities were clarified through an
        IImplementation interface.  The "connector" attribute of the testing
        and async implementations was renamed to "connect". The old name
        still works.
        
        - Implementations are now required to log handler errors and to close
        connections in response to connection-handler errors. (Otherwise,
        handlers, and especially handler adapters, would have to do this.)
        
        ==================
        1.0.1 (2007-05-30)
        ==================
        
        Bugs fixed:
        
        - Server startups sometimes failed with an error like::
        
        warning: unhandled read event
        warning: unhandled write event
        warning: unhandled read event
        warning: unhandled write event

        Network Gateway Interface
        =========================
        
        Network programs are typically difficult to test because they require
        setting up network connections, clients, and servers.  In addition,
        application code gets mixed up with networking code.
        
        The Network Gateway Interface (NGI) seeks to improve this situation by
        separating application code from network code.  This allows
        application and network code to be tested independently and provides
        greater separation of concerns.
        
        There are several interfaces defined by the NGI:
        
        IImplementation
        APIs for implementing and connecting to TCP servers and for
        implemented and sending messages to UDP servers.
        
        IConnection
        Network connection implementation.  This is the core interface that
        applications interact with,
        
        IConnectionHandler
        Application component that handles TCP network input.
        
        IClientConnectHandler
        Application callback that handles successful or failed outgoing
        TCP connections.
        
        IServer
        Application callback to handle incoming connections.
        
        IUDPHandler
        Application callback to handle incoming UDP messages.
        
        The interfaces are split between "implementation" and "application"
        interfaces.  An implementation of the NGI provides Implementation,
        IConnection, IListener, and IUDPListener. An application provides
        IConnectionHandler and one or more of IClientConnectHandler,
        IServer, or IUDPHandler.
        
        For more information, see interfaces.py.
        
        Testing Implementation
        ======================
        
        These interface can have a number of implementations.  The simplest
        implementation is the testing implementation, which is used to test
        application code.
        
        >>> import zc.ngi.testing
        
        The testing module provides IConnection, IConnector, and IListener
        implementations. We'll use this below to illustrate how application code
        is written.
        
        Implementing Network Clients
        ============================
        
        Network clients make connections to and then use these connections to
        communicate with servers.  To do so, a client must be provided with an
        IConnector implantation.  How this happens is outside the scope of
        the NGI.  An IConnector implementation could, for example, be provided
        via the Zope component architecture, or via pkg_resources entry
        points.
        
        Let's create a simple client that calls an echo server and verifies
        that the server properly echoes data sent do it.
        
        >>> class EchoClient:
        ...
        ...     def __init__(self, connect):
        ...         self.connect = connect
        ...
        ...     def check(self, addr, strings):
        ...         self.strings = strings
        ...         self.connect(addr, self)
        ...
        ...     def connected(self, connection):
        ...         for s in self.strings:
        ...             connection.write(s + '\n')
        ...         self.input = ''
        ...         connection.setHandler(self)
        ...
        ...     def failed_connect(self, reason):
        ...         print 'failed connect:', reason
        ...
        ...     def handle_input(self, connection, data):
        ...         print 'got input:', repr(data)
        ...         self.input += data
        ...         while '\n' in self.input:
        ...             data, self.input = self.input.split('\n', 1)
        ...             if self.strings:
        ...                expected = self.strings.pop(0)
        ...                if data == expected:
        ...                    print 'matched:', data
        ...                else:
        ...                    print 'unmatched:', data
        ...                if not self.strings:
        ...                    connection.close()
        ...             else:
        ...                print 'Unexpected input', data
        ...
        ...     def handle_close(self, connection, reason):
        ...         print 'closed:', reason
        ...         if self.strings:
        ...             print 'closed prematurely'
        ...
        ...     def handle_exception(self, connection, exception):
        ...         print 'exception:', exception.__class__.__name__, exception
        
        
        The client implements the IClientConnectHandler and IConnectionHandler
        interfaces.  More complex clients might implement these interfaces with
        separate classes.
        
        We'll instantiate our client using the testing connect:
        
        >>> client = EchoClient(zc.ngi.testing.connect)
        
        Now we'll try to check a non-existent server:
        
        >>> client.check(('localhost', 42), ['hello', 'world', 'how are you?'])
        failed connect: no such server
        
        Our client simply prints a message (and gives up) if a connection
        fails. More complex applications might retry, waiting between attempts,
        and so on.
        
        The testing connect always fails unless given a test connection
        ahead of time.  We'll create a testing connection and register it so a
        connection can succeed:
        
        >>> connection = zc.ngi.testing.Connection()
        >>> zc.ngi.testing.connectable(('localhost', 42), connection)
        
        We can register multiple connections with the same address:
        
        >>> connection2 = zc.ngi.testing.Connection()
        >>> zc.ngi.testing.connectable(('localhost', 42), connection2)
        
        The connections will be used in order.
        
        Now, our client should be able to connect to the first connection we
        created:
        
        >>> client.check(('localhost', 42), ['hello', 'world', 'how are you?'])
        -> 'hello\n'
        -> 'world\n'
        -> 'how are you?\n'
        
        The test connection echoes data written to it, preceded by "-> ".
        
        Active connections are true:
        
        >>> bool(connection2)
        True
        
        Test connections provide methods generating test input and flow closing
        connections.  We can use these to simulate network events.  Let's
        generate some input for our client:
        
        >>> connection.test_input('hello')
        got input: 'hello'
        
        >>> connection.test_input('\nbob\n')
        got input: '\nbob\n'
        matched: hello
        unmatched: bob
        
        >>> connection.test_close('done')
        closed: done
        closed prematurely
        
        >>> client.check(('localhost', 42), ['hello'])
        -> 'hello\n'
        
        >>> connection2.test_input('hello\n')
        got input: 'hello\n'
        matched: hello
        -> CLOSE
        
        >>> bool(connection2)
        False
        
        Passing iterables to connections
        ================================
        
        The writelines method of IConnection accepts iterables of strings.
        
        >>> def greet():
        ...     yield 'hello\n'
        ...     yield 'world\n'
        
        >>> zc.ngi.testing.Connection().writelines(greet())
        -> 'hello\n'
        -> 'world\n'
        
        If there is an error in your iterator, or if the iterator returns
        a non-string value, an exception will be reported using
        handle_exception:
        
        >>> def bad():
        ...     yield 2
        >>> connection = zc.ngi.testing.Connection()
        >>> connection.setHandler(zc.ngi.testing.PrintingHandler(connection))
        >>> connection.writelines(bad())
        -> EXCEPTION TypeError Got a non-string result from iterable
        
        
        Implementing network servers
        ============================
        
        Implementing network servers is very similar to implementing clients,
        except that a listener, rather than a connect is used.  Let's
        implement a simple echo server:
        
        
        >>> class EchoServer:
        ...
        ...     def __init__(self, connection):
        ...         print 'server connected'
        ...         self.input = ''
        ...         connection.setHandler(self)
        ...
        ...     def handle_input(self, connection, data):
        ...         print 'server got input:', repr(data)
        ...         self.input += data
        ...         if '\n' in self.input:
        ...             data, self.input = self.input.split('\n', 1)
        ...             connection.write(data + '\n')
        ...             if data == 'Q':
        ...                 connection.close()
        ...
        ...     def handle_close(self, connection, reason):
        ...         print 'server closed:', reason
        
        Out EchoServer *class* provides IServer and implement IInputHandler.
        
        To use a server, we need a listener.  We'll use the use the testing
        listener:
        
        >>> listener = zc.ngi.testing.listener(EchoServer)
        
        To simulate a client connection, we create a testing connection and
        call the listener's connect method:
        
        >>> connection = zc.ngi.testing.Connection()
        >>> listener.connect(connection)
        server connected
        
        >>> connection.test_input('hello\n')
        server got input: 'hello\n'
        -> 'hello\n'
        
        >>> connection.test_close('done')
        server closed: done
        
        >>> connection = zc.ngi.testing.Connection()
        >>> listener.connect(connection)
        server connected
        
        >>> connection.test_input('hello\n')
        server got input: 'hello\n'
        -> 'hello\n'
        
        >>> connection.test_input('Q\n')
        server got input: 'Q\n'
        -> 'Q\n'
        -> CLOSE
        
        Note that it is an error to write to a closed connection:
        
        >>> connection.write('Hello')
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        TypeError: Connection closed
        
        
        Server Control
        --------------
        
        The object returned from a listener is an IServerControl.  It provides
        access to the active connections:
        
        >>> list(listener.connections())
        []
        
        >>> connection = zc.ngi.testing.Connection()
        >>> listener.connect(connection)
        server connected
        
        >>> list(listener.connections()) == [connection]
        True
        
        >>> connection2 = zc.ngi.testing.Connection()
        >>> listener.connect(connection2)
        server connected
        
        >>> len(list(listener.connections()))
        2
        >>> connection in list(listener.connections())
        True
        >>> connection2 in list(listener.connections())
        True
        
        Server connections have a control attribute that is the connections
        server control:
        
        >>> connection.control is listener
        True
        
        Server control objects provide a close method that allows a server to
        be shut down.  If the close method is called without arguments, then
        then all server connections are closed immediately and no more
        connections are accepted:
        
        >>> listener.close()
        server closed: stopped
        server closed: stopped
        
        >>> connection = zc.ngi.testing.Connection()
        >>> listener.connect(connection)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        TypeError: Listener closed
        
        If a handler function is passed, then connections aren't closed
        immediately:
        
        >>> listener = zc.ngi.testing.listener(EchoServer)
        >>> connection = zc.ngi.testing.Connection()
        >>> listener.connect(connection)
        server connected
        >>> connection2 = zc.ngi.testing.Connection()
        >>> listener.connect(connection2)
        server connected
        
        >>> def handler(control):
        ...     if control is listener:
        ...        print 'All connections closed'
        
        >>> listener.close(handler)
        
        But no more connections are accepted:
        
        >>> connection3 = zc.ngi.testing.Connection()
        >>> listener.connect(connection3)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        TypeError: Listener closed
        
        And the handler will be called when all of the listener's connections
        are closed:
        
        >>> connection.close()
        -> CLOSE
        >>> connection2.close()
        -> CLOSE
        All connections closed
        
        Long output
        ===========
        
        Test requests output data written to them.  If output exceeds 50
        characters in length, it is wrapped by simply breaking the repr into
        50-characters parts:
        
        >>> connection = zc.ngi.testing.Connection()
        >>> connection.write('hello ' * 50)
        -> 'hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello h
        .> ello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hel
        .> lo hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello
        .>  hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello h
        .> ello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hel
        .> lo hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello
        .>  '
        
        Text output
        ===========
        
        If the output from an application consists of short lines of text, a
        TextConnection can be used.  A TextConnection simply outputs it's data
        directly.
        
        >>> connection = zc.ngi.testing.TextConnection()
        >>> connection.write('hello\nworld\n')
        hello
        world
        
        END_OF_DATA
        ===========
        
        Closing a connection closes it immediately, without sending any
        pending data.  An alternate way to close a connection is to write
        zc.ngi.END_OF_DATA. The connection will be automatically closed when
        zc.ngi.END_OF_DATA is encountered in the output stream.
        
        >>> connection.write(zc.ngi.END_OF_DATA)
        -> CLOSE
        
        >>> connection.write('Hello')
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        TypeError: Connection closed
        
        Connecting servers and clients
        ==============================
        
        It is sometimes useful to connect a client handler and a server
        handler.  Listeners created with the zc.ngi.testing.listener class have a
        connect method that can be used to create connections to a server.
        
        Let's connect out echo server and client. First, we'll create out
        server using the listener constructor:
        
        >>> listener = zc.ngi.testing.listener(EchoServer)
        
        Then we'll use the connect method on the listener:
        
        >>> client = EchoClient(listener.connect)
        >>> client.check(('localhost', 42), ['hello', 'world', 'how are you?'])
        server connected
        server got input: 'hello\n'
        server got input: 'world\n'
        server got input: 'how are you?\n'
        got input: 'hello\nworld\nhow are you?\n'
        matched: hello
        matched: world
        matched: how are you?
        server closed: closed
        
        .. Peer connectors
        
        Below is an older API for connecting servers and clients in a
        testing environment.  The mechanisms defined above are prefered.
        
        The zc.ngi.testing.peer function can be used to create a
        connection to a peer handler. To illustrate, we'll set up an echo
        client that connects to our echo server:
        
        >>> client = EchoClient(zc.ngi.testing.peer(('localhost', 42), EchoServer))
        >>> client.check(('localhost', 42), ['hello', 'world', 'how are you?'])
        server connected
        server got input: 'hello\n'
        server got input: 'world\n'
        server got input: 'how are you?\n'
        got input: 'hello\nworld\nhow are you?\n'
        matched: hello
        matched: world
        matched: how are you?
        server closed: closed
        
        UDP Support
        ===========
        
        To send a UDP message, just use an implementations udp method:
        
        >>> zc.ngi.testing.udp(('', 42), "hello")
        
        If there isn't a server listening, the call will effectively be
        ignored. This is UDP. :)
        
        >>> def my_udp_handler(addr, data):
        ...     print 'from %r got %r' % (addr, data)
        
        >>> listener = zc.ngi.testing.udp_listener(('', 42), my_udp_handler)
        
        >>> zc.ngi.testing.udp(('', 42), "hello")
        from '<test>' got 'hello'
        
        >>> listener.close()
        >>> zc.ngi.testing.udp(('', 42), "hello")
        
        A default handler is used if you don't pass a handler:
        
        >>> listener = zc.ngi.testing.udp_listener(('', 43))
        >>> zc.ngi.testing.udp(('', 43), "hello")
        udp from '<test>' to ('', 43):
        'hello'
        
        >>> listener.close()
        >>> zc.ngi.testing.udp(('', 43), "hello")
        
        =======================
        Blocking network access
        =======================
        
        The NGI normally uses an event-based networking model in which
        application code reactes to incoming data.  That model works well for
        some applications, especially server applications, but can be a bit of
        a bother for simpler applications, especially client applications.
        
        The zc.ngi.blocking module provides a simple blocking network model.
        The open function can be used to create a pair of file-like objects
        that can be used for writing output and reading input.  To illustrate
        this, we'll use the wordcount server.  We'll use the peer function to
        create a testing connector that connects to the server directory
        without using a network:
        
        >>> import zc.ngi.wordcount
        >>> import zc.ngi.testing
        >>> connector = zc.ngi.testing.peer(('localhost', 42),
        ...                                 zc.ngi.wordcount.Server)
        
        The open function is called with an address and a connect callable:
        
        >>> import zc.ngi.blocking
        >>> output, input = zc.ngi.blocking.open(('localhost', 42), connector)
        
        The output file lets us send output to the server:
        
        >>> output.write("Hello\n")
        >>> output.write("world\n")
        >>> output.write("\0")
        
        The wordcount server accepts a sequence of text from the
        client. Delimited by null characters.  For each input text, it
        generates a line of summary statistics:
        
        >>> input.readline()
        '2 2 12\n'
        
        We can use the writelines method to send data using an iterator:
        
        >>> def hello(name):
        ...     yield "hello\n"
        ...     yield name
        ...     yield "\0"
        
        >>> output.writelines(hello("everyone"))
        >>> output.writelines(hello("bob"))
        
        To close the connection to the server, we'll send a close command,
        which is a documenty consisting of the letter "C":
        
        >>> output.write("C\0")
        
        This causes the server to close the connection after it has sent it's
        data.
        
        We can use the read function to read either a fixed number of bytes
        from the server:
        
        >>> input.read(5)
        '1 2 1'
        
        Or to read the remaining data:
        
        >>> input.read()
        '4\n1 2 9\n'
        
        If read is called without a size, it won't return until the server has
        closed the connection.
        
        In this example, we've been careful to only read as much data as the
        server produces.  For example, we called read without passing a length
        only after sending a quit command to the server.  When using the
        blocking library, care is needed to avoid a deadlock, in which both
        sides of a connection are waiting for input.
        
        The blocking open and input methods accept an optional timeout
        argument.  The timeout argument accepts a floating-point time-out
        value, in seconds.  If a connection or input operation times out, a
        Timeout exception is raised:
        
        >>> output, input = zc.ngi.blocking.open(('localhost', 42), connector)
        >>> import time
        >>> then = time.time()
        >>> input.read(5, timeout=0.5)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        Timeout
        
        >>> 0.5 <= (time.time() - then) < 1
        True
        
        The readline and readlines functions accept a timeout as well:
        
        >>> then = time.time()
        >>> input.readline(timeout=0.5)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        Timeout
        
        >>> 0.5 <= (time.time() - then) < 1
        True
        
        >>> then = time.time()
        >>> input.readlines(timeout=0.5)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        Timeout
        
        >>> 0.5 <= (time.time() - then) < 1
        True
        
        Timeouts can also be specified when connecting. To illustrate this,
        we'll pass a do-nothing connector:
        
        >>> then = time.time()
        >>> zc.ngi.blocking.open(None, (lambda *args: None), timeout=0.5)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ConnectionTimeout
        
        >>> 0.5 <= (time.time() - then) < 1
        True
        
        Low-level connection management
        ===============================
        
        When we used open above, we passed an address and a connect callable, and the
        open function created a connection and created file-like objects for
        output and input.  The connect function can be used to create a
        connection without a file-like object:
        
        >>> connection = zc.ngi.blocking.connect(('localhost', 42), connector)
        
        The if the open function is called without a connect callable, the the first
        object must be a connection object and output and input objects for
        that connection will be returned:
        
        >>> output, input = zc.ngi.blocking.open(connection)
        >>> output.write("Hello\n")
        >>> output.write("world\n")
        >>> output.write("\0")
        >>> input.readline()
        '2 2 12\n'
        
        Like the open function, the connect function accepts a timeout:
        
        >>> then = time.time()
        >>> zc.ngi.blocking.connect(None, (lambda *args: None), timeout=0.5)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ConnectionTimeout
        
        >>> 0.5 <= (time.time() - then) < 1
        True
        
        ============
        NGI Adapters
        ============
        
        The NGI is a fairly low-level event-based framework.  Adapters can be
        used to build higher-level semantics.  In this document, we'll describe
        some sample adapters that provide more examples of using the NGI and
        useful building blocks for other applications. The source for these
        adapters can be found in the zc.ngi.adapters module.
        
        Lines
        =====
        
        The first adapter we'll look at collects input into lines. To
        illustrate this, we'll use a handler from zc.ngi.testing that simply
        prints its input:
        
        >>> import zc.ngi.testing
        >>> connection = zc.ngi.testing.Connection()
        >>> handler = zc.ngi.testing.PrintingHandler(connection)
        
        This handler is used by default as the peer
        of testing connections:
        
        >>> connection.test_input('x' * 80)
        -> 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
        .> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
        
        >>> connection.test_close('test')
        -> CLOSE test
        
        Now, we'll use the lines adapter to break input into lines, separated
        by newlines.  We apply the adapter to a connection:
        
        >>> import zc.ngi.adapters
        >>> connection = zc.ngi.testing.Connection()
        >>> adapter = zc.ngi.adapters.Lines(connection)
        >>> handler = zc.ngi.testing.PrintingHandler(adapter)
        
        Now, when we provide input, it won't appear until lines are complete:
        
        >>> connection.test_input('Hello world!')
        >>> connection.test_input('\n')
        -> 'Hello world!'
        
        >>> connection.test_input('Hello\nWorld!\nHow are you')
        -> 'Hello'
        -> 'World!'
        
        Only input handling is affected.  Other methods of the adapter behave
        as would the underlying connection:
        
        >>> adapter.write('foo')
        -> 'foo'
        
        >>> adapter.writelines(['foo', 'bar'])
        -> 'foo'
        -> 'bar'
        
        >>> connection.test_close('test')
        -> CLOSE test
        
        The original connection is available in the connection attribute:
        
        >>> adapter.connection is connection
        True
        
        Sized Messages
        ==============
        
        The second adapter we'll look at will handle binary data organized
        into sized messages.  Each message has two parts, a length, and a
        payload.  Of course, the length gives the length of the payload.
        
        To see this, we'll use the adapter to adapt a testing connection:
        
        >>> connection = zc.ngi.testing.Connection()
        >>> adapter = zc.ngi.adapters.Sized(connection)
        >>> handler = zc.ngi.testing.PrintingHandler(adapter)
        
        Now, we'll generate some input. We do so by providing (big-endian) sizes by
        calling struct pack:
        
        >>> import struct
        >>> message1 = 'Hello\nWorld!\nHow are you?'
        >>> message2 = 'This is message 2'
        >>> connection.test_input(struct.pack(">I", len(message1)))
        >>> connection.test_input(message1[:10])
        >>> connection.test_input(message1[10:]+ struct.pack(">I", len(message2)))
        -> 'Hello\nWorld!\nHow are you?'
        
        >>> connection.test_input(message2)
        -> 'This is message 2'
        
        Here we saw that our handler got the two messages individually.
        
        If we write a message, we can see that the message is preceded by the
        message size:
        
        >>> adapter.write(message1)
        -> '\x00\x00\x00\x19'
        -> 'Hello\nWorld!\nHow are you?'
        
        Null messages
        -------------
        
        It can be useful to send Null messages to make sure that a client is
        still connected.  The sized adapter supports such messages.  Calling
        write with None, sends a null message, which is a message with a
        length of 1 << 32 - 1 and no message data:
        
        >>> adapter.write(None)
        -> '\xff\xff\xff\xff'
        
        On input, Null messages are ignored by the sized adapter and are not
        sent to the application:
        
        >>> connection.test_input('\xff\xff\xff\xff')
        
        Closing
        -------
        
        Closing works too.
        
        >>> connection.test_close('test')
        -> CLOSE test
        
        =================================
        asyncore-based NGI implementation
        =================================
        
        The async module provides an NGI implementation based on the Python
        standard asyncore framework.  It provides 2 objects to be invoked
        directly by applications:
        
        connector
        an implementation of the NGI IConnector interface
        
        listener
        an implementation of the NGI IListener interface
        
        The implementation creates a dedicated thread to run an asyncore main
        loop on import.
        
        There's nothing else to say about the implementation from a usage
        point of view.  The remainder of this document provides a
        demonstration (test) of using the impemantation to create a simple
        word-count server and client.
        
        Demonstration: wordcount
        ========================
        
        The wordcount module has a simple word-count server and client
        implementation.  We'll run these using the async implementation.
        
        Let's start the wordcount server:
        
        >>> import zc.ngi.wordcount
        >>> import zc.ngi.async
        >>> port = zc.ngi.wordcount.start_server_process(zc.ngi.async.listener)
        
        We passed the listener to be used.
        
        Now, we'll start a number of threads that connect to the server and
        check word counts of some sample documents.  If all goes well, we
        shouldn't get any output.
        
        >>> import threading
        >>> addr = 'localhost', port
        >>> threads = [threading.Thread(target=zc.ngi.wordcount.client_thread,
        ...                             args=(zc.ngi.async.connect, addr))
        ...            for i in range(200)]
        
        >>> _ = [thread.start() for thread in threads]
        >>> _ = [thread.join() for thread in threads]
        
        Iterable input
        ==============
        
        We can pass data to the server using an iterator.  To illustrate this,
        we'll use the blocking interface:
        
        >>> import zc.ngi.blocking
        >>> output, input = zc.ngi.blocking.open(addr, zc.ngi.async.connect,
        ...                                      timeout=1.0)
        >>> def hello(name):
        ...     yield "hello\n"
        ...     yield name
        ...     yield "\0"
        
        >>> output.writelines(hello('world'), timeout=1.0)
        >>> input.readline(timeout=1.0)
        '1 2 11\n'
        
        .. Error handling:
        
        If we pass a non-iterable to writelines, we'll get an immediate
        error.  To demonstrate this we'll violate our output file and
        access it's _connection attribute so that we can bypass the check
        in the blocking writelines method:
        
        >>> output._connection.writelines(2) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        TypeError: ...
        
        >>> output._connection.writelines('foo')
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        AssertionError: writelines does not accept strings
        
        If we pass an iterable that returns a non-string, we'll get a type
        error when we try to read because handle_exception is called in
        the input handler.
        
        >>> output.writelines([2], timeout=0.1)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        Timeout
        
        >>> input.readline()
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        TypeError: ('iterable output returned a non-string', 2)
        
        If there is an error, then the connection is closed:
        
        >>> input.read()
        ''
        
        >>> output.write('hello')
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        IOError: I/O operation on closed file
        
        Handler errors cause connections to be closed.  To see this, we'll
        send the server an error message, which foreces an error:
        
        >>> output, input = zc.ngi.blocking.open(addr, zc.ngi.async.connect,
        ...                                      timeout=1.0)
        >>> output.write('E\0')
        >>> input.read()
        ''
        
        Let's create some lame clients:
        
        >>> import zope.testing.loggingsupport, logging
        >>> loghandler = zope.testing.loggingsupport.InstalledHandler(
        ...                  None, level=logging.ERROR)
        
        >>> event = threading.Event()
        >>> class LameClientConnectionHandler:
        ...     def connected(self, connection):
