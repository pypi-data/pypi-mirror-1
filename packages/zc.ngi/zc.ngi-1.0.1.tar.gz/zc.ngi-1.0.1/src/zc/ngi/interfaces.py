"""Network Gateway Interface (NGI)

The interfaces are split between "implementation" and "application"
interfaces.  An implementation of the NGI provides IConnection,
IConnector, and IListener. An application provides IConnectionHandler
and one or both of IClientConnectHandler and IServer.

The NGI is an event-based framework in the sense that applications
register handlers that respond to input events.  There are 3 kinds of
handlers:

- Input handlers receive network input

- Client-connect handlers respond to outbound connection events, and

- Servers respond to incoming connection events.

The interfaces are designed to allow single-threaded applications:

- An implementation of the interfaces is not allowed to make multiple
  simultaneous calls to the same application handler.  (Note that this
  requirement does not extend across multiple implementations.
  Theoretically, different implementations could call handlers at the
  same time.)

- All handler calls that are associated with a connection include the
  connection as a parameter,  This allows a single handler object to
  respond to events from multiple connections.

Applications may be multi-threaded.  This means that implementations
must be thread safe.  This means that, unless otherwise stated, calls
into the implementation could be made at any time.
