--- New in Py-gtktree 0.1.4  (15 November 2009) ----------------------

* Both list and tree store now natively support sorting (implement
  gtk.TreeSortable interface).

* Most examples are updated to demonstrate sorting feature.

* There is now a C extension used to workaround deficiency in PyGTK
  that prevents implementation of gtk.TreeSortable.

* Fixes.

* Expanded documentation.

* 64 tests.


--- New in Py-gtktree 0.1.3  (8 November 2009) -----------------------

* Improved drag'n'drop support in tree store; one more example.

* Support for 'dotted' column attributes.

* Subclassing nodes is not needed anymore as they pick up required
  properties and methods from row object with duck typing.

* Utility functions to enable simple inline editing in tree views.

* Standard algorithms for traversing arbitrary subtrees.

* Many fixes.

* Significantly expanded documentation.

* 51 tests.
