                             REQUIREMENTS

Py-gtktree requires Python 2.5 or 2.6 and PyGTK 2.12 or later.
Porting to Python 3.0 will be done when PyGTK itself works with it.



                 PY-GTKTREE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Py-gtktree is a typical Python package using distutils.  So, just
executing

        ./setup.py install

under a super-user account from this directory should suffice.
However, it will create root-owned files in the source tree, so you
should invoke './setup.py build' and './setup.py install' (as
super-user) separately.  See './setup.py --help' for more information.
