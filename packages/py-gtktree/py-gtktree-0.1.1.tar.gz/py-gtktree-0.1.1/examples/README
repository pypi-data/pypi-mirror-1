                         PY-GTKTREE EXAMPLES

Py-gtktree comes with a set of examples that show how to use the
package.  All examples have their source code divided into sections.
The part or parts that are actually relevant to Py-gtktree and the
demonstrated functionality have 'EXAMPLE:' in their titles.  Parts
titled 'Importing and other auxiliary stuff', 'Loading UI definition'
and 'General UI setup' involve some routine setup and can be skipped.

All examples use external UI definition in XML files loaded with
gtk.Builder to avoid cluttering the code.



                     EXAMPLE USAGE OF LIST MODEL

Several examples show how to create and use RowObjectListStore.  They
range from simple model creation to more advanced topics like
drag'n'drop and lazy loading.

simple_list.py

    Demonstrates simple usage of RowObjectListStore with pre-existing
    objects.  You can use any objects as model rows, in this casex
    imported Python modules.

drag_between_lists.py

    Creates two lists of objects and enables dragging between them.
    Note that the lists have different number of columns, yet it
    doesn't hinder drag'n'drop at all.  The objects in both lists are
    the same and are completely unrelated to model columns.

lazy_value_loading.py

    Demonstrates lazy loading of individual values in a list.  Uses
    several methods in TreeViewUtils to watch and retrieve set of
    currently visible rows.  Adds a random delay before a value is
    loaded to make loading visible and emulate some slow connection.
