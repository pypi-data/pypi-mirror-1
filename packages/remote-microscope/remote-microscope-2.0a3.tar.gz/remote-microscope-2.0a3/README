Remote Microscope 2.0alpha3
===========================

The remote microscope is a client/server system for remotely
controlling a microscope over the Internet.  


Requirements
============

The list of required software and drivers is lengthy, but you probably
don't need *all* of the

* A recent version of Python (www.python.org).  We use Python 2.2;
  minor changes are probably required for Python 2.1, but we haven't
  checked.  (I'd likely accept patches to make the code work with
  2.1.)

  Debian package name: python, python-dev.

* The Python Imaging Library (www.pythonware.com/products/pil), used
  for manipulating bitmapped images, converting them to JPEG, etc.  

  Debian package name: python-imaging.


Optional components (depending on your configuration)

* The SANE scanner API (www.mostang.com/sane/).  Required to use the Polaroid 
  DMC camera.  The Python Imaging Library will also need to have been
  compiled with the SANE module.

  Debian package name: libsane

* The PXC-200 driver for Linux (http://ar.linux.it/software/#pxc).  
  Required to use the ImageNation PXC-200 frame grabber.  You'll also
  need the Python PXC-200 extension
  (http://www.mems-exchange.org/software/pxc200/).
	

Installation
============

To install the remote microscope code, simply run "python setup.py
install".  This will install the mems.instrument package in your
Python installation's site-packages/ directory, and two scripts will
be added to /usr/local/bin/:

	microscoped	  The microscope daemon.
	start-microscope  Script to start and stop the microscope daemon.
	                  You could symlink to this script from /etc/init.d.
