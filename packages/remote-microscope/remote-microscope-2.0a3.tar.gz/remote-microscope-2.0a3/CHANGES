2.0alpha3: 

        * Massive reworking: the specialized protocol has been discarded,
          and replaced with HTTP.  As a result, the server now presents 
          a web-based interface, and the microscope can be accessed 
          using any reasonably modern browser such as Mozilla or Opera.


2.0alpha2: 

	* Changed how images are sent out; the client now requests them,
	  instead of the server automatically pushing them out.

	* Added 'feedback' message, so users can send comments to us
	  from inside the microscope client.

	* Added 'message' message, so the server can cause brief messages 
	  to be displayed on the client.

	* Tidied up startup by making 3 attempts to open the FIFO, in
	  case the listening process just hasn't gotten around to
	  opening it yet.

	* Made the fake microscope actually resize and pan around a 
          sample image, instead of just displaying random images.
          
	* [Tk client] Fixed hang caused by 'Connection broken' dialog 

	* [Tk client] Closing login dialog closes the client application.


2.0alpha1: 

	* Initial revision of the new server code.
