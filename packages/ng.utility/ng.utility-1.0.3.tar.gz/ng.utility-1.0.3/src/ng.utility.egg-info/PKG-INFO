        Package interfacewave
        ---------------------
        This package components catch event emited by object with interface
        **IUserInterfaceWave** on creating and asign new object all interfaces from
        its parent if them extent **IPropagateInterface** interface.
        
        Hierarhy of object with dynamic interfaces such as their parents can be
