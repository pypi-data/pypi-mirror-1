collective.portlet.rich Package Readme
=========================

Overview
--------
This requires a special branch of plone.app.forms, not if Plone 3.1.* is in use.

For most users plone.portlet.static would be enough.


TODO
--------

* Setup basic cache / @memoize 


NICETOHAVE
--------

* links
    - store internal links like UID. 
    - UID lookup could be done like portal.unrestrictedTraverse("/internal-link/to-my-special-page").UID()

collective.formlib.link should solve ^^
    
* better plone UI, for now this is used at a project with a 99% different UI. 

* cross browser css check
