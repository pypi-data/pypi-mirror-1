Lavengro 1.2

Lavengro is a cross-platform, console-based vocabulary-test
engine.  It uses text files as its tests. The tests themselves
are created by you. It has a tutor mode, a test mode, and a CBT
learning mode.  There is also a bsd-quiz mode for nostalgia's
sake.

WARNING: none

== Release Notes ==

Improved numbering of options in menus.

Changed order of menus to: subject - mode - test.  This keeps the
program within the given subject for the session.
