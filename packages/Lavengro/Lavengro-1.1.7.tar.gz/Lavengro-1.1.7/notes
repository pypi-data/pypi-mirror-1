Lavengro 1.1.7

Lavengro is a cross-platform, console-based vocabulary-test engine.  It
uses text files as its tests. The tests themselves are created by
you. It has a tutor mode, a test mode, and a CBT learning mode. 
There is also a bsd-quiz mode for nostalgia's sake.

WARNING: none

== Release Notes ==
