Lavengro Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install the package, run the following command:

						python setup.py install

Alternatively, copy the whole Lavengro directory into your Python path
(eg. unix: /usr/local/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages, Windows: C:\PythonXY,
or C:\PythonXY\Lib\site-packages).  That's all that setup.py does.  Only
copy the Lavengro directory that's inside the distributed
tarball/zip-archive, not the entire Lavengro-x.x.x directory!

The docs directory is not handled by setup.py.  You can put these
anywhere that is convenient.

The executable file is "lavengro" in the user directory.  Put this
anywhere on your path.
