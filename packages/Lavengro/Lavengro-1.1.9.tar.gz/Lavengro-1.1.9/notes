Lavengro 1.1.9

Lavengro is a cross-platform, console-based vocabulary-test engine.  It
uses text files as its tests. The tests themselves are created by
you. It has a tutor mode, a test mode, and a CBT learning mode. 
There is also a bsd-quiz mode for nostalgia's sake.

WARNING: none

== Release Notes ==

Added error-handling to prevent destruction of .lav file when
a test fails to load.  Most tests fail to load because of a 
missing ":".
