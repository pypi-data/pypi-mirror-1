Lavengro README

Lavengro is a cross-platform, console-based vocabulary-test engine.  It
uses text files as its tests. The tests themselves are created by
you. It has a tutor mode, a test mode, and a CBT learning mode. 

Lavengro is used as the test-engine for the Pobble project.  There is
also a Lavengro_B which has been ported to the Python Gander application
server.

Installation is described in the INSTALL file.

Using Lavengro is explained in Lavengro.html in the docs directory.
