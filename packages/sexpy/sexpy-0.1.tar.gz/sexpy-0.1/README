SEXpy - Python meets S-expressions
==================================

Created just in order to have some se^Wfun.

Tested with CPython 2.4 and 2.5 and PyPy 1.0.0.

A little code snippet so that you can get the overall idea::

    (class (Hello)
        (def (__init__ self message)
            (= self.message message))
        (def (hello)
            (print self.message)))
     
    (= hello (Hello "Hello world!"))
    (hello.hello)
