v0.1.1:

    * name lookups inside a namespace() or keyspace() context now look in
      outer scopes if the name is not an existing attribute/key.
    * more robust bytecode capture; the previous version was easily fooled
      by jump-based control structures.
    * CaptureLocals now looks at the captured bytecode to determine what
      locals were assigned inside the block; use CaptureModifiedLocals to
      obtain the previous (quicker, but less reliable) behaviour.
    * much more extensive test suite.

v0.1.0:

    * initial release - you might say *everything* has changed...
