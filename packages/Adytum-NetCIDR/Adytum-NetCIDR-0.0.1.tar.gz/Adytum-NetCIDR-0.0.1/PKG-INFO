Description: There are five major chunks of functionality to this library:
        * create CIDR addresses for hosts and net blocks
        * get node counts for any given netblock
        * get ranges of addresses for net blocks
        * create collections of networks (list subclass)
        * determine if a CIDR address is in a given network or set of networks (__contains__ override)
