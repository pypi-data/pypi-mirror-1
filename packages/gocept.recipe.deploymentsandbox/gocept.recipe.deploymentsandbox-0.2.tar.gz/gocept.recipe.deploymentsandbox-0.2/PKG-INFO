Description: =========================
        Sandbox deployment recipe
        =========================
        
        This recipe can be used to create deployments that are located in a sandbox.
        This is useful for deploying self-contained buildouts or for development
        setups that are going to use a deployment recipe in the future.
        
        It is compatible to zc.recipe.deployment and can be used as a drop-in.
        
        It is not intended for system-wide deployments, please use
        zc.recipe.deployment for that.

        Sandbox environments
        ====================
        
        This recipe creates a sandbox environment for deployments similar to
        zc.recipe.deployment. It is not intended for system-wide installation but as a
        sandboxed/development variation of the deployment pattern.
        
        For production, system-wide deployments you can simply switch out a sandbox
        deployment part with a real deployment part.
        
        A root directory is defined for the sandbox (by default this is
        `parts/${name}`) in which the following directory structure is created::
        
        ${root}/var/run
        ${root}/var/log
        ${root}/etc/
        ${root}/etc/cron.d
        ${root}/etc/init.d
        ${root}/etc/logrotate.d
        
        Additionally to be able to mix multiple deployments within a single sandbox we
        compute the following paths compatible to zc.recipe.deployment::
        
        crontab-directory
        logrotate-directory
        rc-directory
        run-directory
        log-directory
        etc-directory
        
        Also, the `user` option is setup to match the current user.
        
        Supported options
        =================
        
        The recipe supports a single optional option:
        
        root
        Optional: The root directory of the sandbox. Will be computed from the
        section name if not given.
        
        
        Example usage
        =============
        
        We'll start by creating a buildout that uses the recipe.
        
        >>> import os
        >>> write('buildout.cfg',
        ... """
        ... [buildout]
        ... parts = deployment
        ...
        ... [deployment]
        ... recipe = gocept.recipe.deploymentsandbox
        ... """)
        
        Running the buildout gives us:
        
        >>> print system(buildout)
        Installing deployment.
        >>> ls(sample_buildout, 'parts')
        d deployment
        >>> ls(sample_buildout, 'parts', 'deployment')
        d etc
        d var
        >>> ls(sample_buildout, 'parts', 'deployment', 'etc')
        d  cron.d
        d  deployment
        d  init.d
        d  logrotate.d
        >>> ls(sample_buildout, 'parts', 'deployment', 'var')
        d log
        d run
        >>> ls(sample_buildout, 'parts', 'deployment', 'var', 'log')
        d deployment
        >>> ls(sample_buildout, 'parts', 'deployment', 'var', 'run')
        d deployment
