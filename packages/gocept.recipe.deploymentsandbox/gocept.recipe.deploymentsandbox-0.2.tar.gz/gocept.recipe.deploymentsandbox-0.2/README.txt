=========================
Sandbox deployment recipe
=========================

This recipe can be used to create deployments that are located in a sandbox.
This is useful for deploying self-contained buildouts or for development
setups that are going to use a deployment recipe in the future.

It is compatible to zc.recipe.deployment and can be used as a drop-in.

It is not intended for system-wide deployments, please use
zc.recipe.deployment for that.
