        ====================
        
        Summary: package releasing made easy.
        
        ``easy_install`` this in a ``virtualenv`` or globally.  It gives you
        some commands to help in releasing python packages.  They must be run
        in a subversion checkout.  These are the commands:
        
        - prerelease: ask the user for a version number (give a sane default),
        update the setup.py or version.txt and the HISTORY.txt with this and
        offer to commit those changes to subversion.
        
        - release: copy the the trunk or branch of the current checkout and
        create a subversion tag of it.  Offer to register and upload a
        source dist of this package to PyPI (Python Package Index).  Note:
        if the package has not been registered yet, we will not do that for
        you.  You must register the package manually (``python setup.py
        register``) so this remains a conscious decision.  The main reason
        is that you want to avoid having to say: "Oops, I uploaded our
        client code to the internet; and this is the initial version with
        the plaintext root passwords."
        
        - postrelease: ask the user for a version number (give a sane
        default), add a development marker to it, update the setup.py or
        version.txt and the HISTORY.txt with this and offer to commit those
        changes to subversion.
        
        - fullrelease: all of the above in order.
        
        
        Changelog for zest.releaser
        ===========================
        
        1.2 (2008-10-16)
        ----------------
        
        - We now prefer the version from setup.py over any version.txt file
        found.  When getting or changing the version we get/change the
        setup.py version when it differs from the found version.txt version.
        [maurits]
        
        
        1.1 (2008-10-15)
        ----------------
        
        - Cleaned out zest-specific stuff. Cleaned up 'release'. [reinout]
        
        
        1.0 (2008-10-15)
        ----------------
        
        - Stabilize looks up the most recent tag of our development packages and uses
        gp.svndevelop to allow svn checkouts as development eggs. [reinout]
        
        - Do not look for version.txt in directories that are not handled by
        subversion.  Use case: Products.feedfeeder, which has a buildout.cfg
        and so can have a parts directory with lots of version.txt files...
        [maurits]
        
        
        0.9 (2008-10-02)
        ----------------
        
        - release: offer to register and upload the egg to the cheese shop.
        After that you still have the option to upload to our own tgz
        server.  [maurits]
        
        - postrelease: for the suggestion of a new version simply try add 1 to
        the last character in the version; the previous logic failed for
        example for '1.0b3'.  [maurits]
        
        - prerelease: ask user to enter next version (give him a suggestion).
        Handy when you want to change '1.0b3 dev' into '1.0'.  [maurits]
        
        - Started 'stabilize'. [reinout]
        
        
        0.8 (2008-09-26)
        ----------------
        
        - fullrelease: change back to the original directory after each
        pre/actual/post release step.  [maurits]
        
        - release: switch back to original directory when ready to fix 'commit
        to tag' error.  [maurits]
        
        - prerelease: quit when no version is found.  [maurits]
        
        - Reverted sleeping fix from 0.7 as it did not work.  [maurits]
        
        
        0.7 (2008-09-26)
        ----------------
        
        - fullrelease: hopefully fix a 'commit on tag' bug by sleeping three
        seconds before doing the post release.  [maurits]
        
        
        0.6 (2008-09-26)
        ----------------
        
        - Added fullrelease script that does a prerelease, actual release and
        post release in one go.  [maurits]
        
        
        0.5 (2008-09-26)
        ----------------
        
        - Factored part of prerelease.check_version() out into
        utils.cleanup_version().  We now use that while setting the version
        in the history during postrelease.  [maurits]
        
        - Add newline at the end of the generated version.txt.  [maurits]
        
        
        0.4 (2008-09-26)
        ----------------
        
        - Made the logging userfriendly.
        
        
        0.3 (2008-09-26)
        ----------------
        
        - Postrelease: Better injection of history. Various other robustness fixes.
        
        
        0.2 (2008-09-26)
        ----------------
        
        - postrelease: added suggestion for new version (a plain enter is enough to
        accept it). [reinout]
        
        - prerelease: ask before changing version + solidified regex for heading
        detection. [reinout]
        
        - prerelease: detect non-development versions better and change them.
        [maurits]
        
        - prerelease: made the commit message read: 'Preparing release xxx'.
        [maurits]
        
        - postrelease: made the new version something like '1.0 dev'.
        [maurits]
        
        - postrelease: we now add some lines to the history now.  [maurits]
        
        - prerelease: try changing the version to a non-development version,
        stripping off something like '(...)'.  [maurits]
        
        - release: Refactored so release.py has the 'main' function required
        by setup.py.  [maurits]
        
        
        0.1 (2008-09-24)
        ----------------
        
        - Got a basic version of the prerelease script working (version check, history
        file updating, committing). [reinout]
        
        - Started by copying the guidelines script. [reinout]
