        ===========
        
        This program can be used to manage the public keys on multiple servers.
        Specify in a configuration file which users with their public keys have
        permission to login to which server with a specific username.
        
        Publickeymanager is usefull if you have multiple users logging in to
        shared accounts on multiple servers.
        
        Config File

        The config file has the following options::
        
        [keys]
        Specify one public key per user.
        
        [group:`users`]
        Use this if you want to bundle multiple users to one group. Say for example
        a sysadmin group.
        
        [group:`name`]
        Specify a group of servers. `name` is the name of the group.
        A config file can hold multiple [group:`name`]
        directives.
        
        Options for [group:`name`]
        --------------------------
        
        The options for the group::
        
        user_groups
        A reference to groups defined in [group:`users`].
        All users in the group have
        access to the servers in this group.
        
        access
        Which individual users have access to servers in this group.
        
        servers
        A list of servers which belong to this group.
        
        [server:`name`]
        Specify a server. A config file can hold multiple [server:`name`]
        directives.
        The name is the name of the server. A name can be referenced in a server
        group.
        
        Options for [server:`name`]
        ---------------------------
        
        The options for the server::
        
        hostname
        The hostname of the server.
        
        user
        The username that is used to login to the server.
        
        groups
        Define which groups have access to this server. Groups need to exist in
        [group:`name`]
        
        access
        Define which users have access to this server.
        Users need have a key file mentioned in [keys].

        [group:remote]
        user_groups =
        sysadmin
        access =
        example_user1
        servers =
        example_server1
        example_server2
        
        [server:localhost]
        hostname = 127.0.0.1
        user = roland
        groups = sysadmin
        access = example
        
        [server:example_server1]
        hostname = example.com
        user = example
