=======

this module releases a buildout, by copying the current one
into a release branch and making a few changes over the .cfg files.

Let's release our buildoutn located in tests::

    >>> buildout_folder = os.path.join(test_dir, 'data', 'buildout')
    >>> import os
    >>> os.chdir(buildout_folder)

Let's release it::

    >>> from project import make_release

    >>> make_release('0.1')
    svn path was existing, removed
    copied http://xxx/my.package/trunk to http://xxx/my.package/releases/0.1
    Added version file to buildout.
