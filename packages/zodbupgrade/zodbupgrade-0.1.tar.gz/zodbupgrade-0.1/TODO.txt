TODO
====

- Compress repeated warnings, ignore warnings that are known to come from the
  framework (factory PermissionSetting: Allow does not have __name__, can't
  check canonical location)

- Provide "offline" updating: read a list of old/new pairs and update pickles
  directly without needing the old code
