Description: Pyntch is a static code analyzer for Python. It detects possible runtime
        errors before actually running a code. Pyntch examines a source
        code statically and infers all possible types of variables,
        attributes, function arguments, and return values of each function
        or method. Then it detects possible errors caused by type
        mismatch, attribute not found, or other types of exceptions raised
        from each function. Unlike other Python code checkers (such as
        Pychecker or Pyflakes), Pyntch does not address style issues.
