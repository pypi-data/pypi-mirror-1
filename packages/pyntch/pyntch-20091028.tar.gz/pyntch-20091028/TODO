TODO:

- better representation of aggregate types (too many "..."s).
- basic execution path analysis.
- cross referencing variables/attributes.
- support special function checking (e.g. pack, unpack, array).
- add more test cases and stub modules.
- finer control of errors/warnings: ignore exceptions raised in certain class/functions.
