CHANGES
=======

0.1.5 (2009-10-16)
------------------

- Improvement: add username and password on install to the URL that buildout
  gets for the .cfg file
  Let's hope that buildout does not leave that password around.

- Improvement(?) or fix: remove twisted dependency that was used in deploy
  for SSH

- Improvement: removed dependency on lxml.  Now we just use pythons
  built-in xml library.

- Improvement: added ``buildout-upload-type`` option.
  See doc for further info

- Bug Fix: multiline template option values crashed on parsing

- Bug Fix: re did not like non-text parameters coming from BeautifulSoup

- Improvement: added the ``--timeout`` option to install

- Improvement: added mypypi buildout file upload support

- Bug Fix: revert to checkout of the complete source tree

0.1.4 (2009-10-01)
------------------

- Bug Fix: installer script would crash when -u option was missing a
  trailing /

- Bug Fix: installer script would crash when no variants were found.

- Improvement: Building a package will no longer checkout the entire
  branch just to update the setup.py file with the new version
  number.  Instead only the top level directory is checked out.

- Bug Fix: project build script would crash when variant
  configuration was missing information required by its template. Now
  a helpful error message is printed and no files will be uploaded
  until all have been created successfully.

- Bug Fix: Typing Ctrl+c on the command line no longer causes a
  KeyboardInterrupt traceback to be spit out.

- Bug Fix: when running the installer, if the buildout command prompts
  the user for input, the installer will no longer eat up the prompt.
