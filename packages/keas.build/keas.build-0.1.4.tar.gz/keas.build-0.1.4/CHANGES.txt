  trailing /

- Bug Fix: installer script would crash when no variants were found.

- Improvement: Building a package will no longer checkout the entire
  branch just to update the setup.py file with the new version
  number.  Instead only the top level directory is checked out.

  configuration was missing information required by its template. Now
  a helpful error message is printed and no files will be uploaded
  until all have been created successfully.

  KeyboardInterrupt traceback to be spit out.
