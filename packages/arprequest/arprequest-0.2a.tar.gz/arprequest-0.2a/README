ArpRequest
==========

General
-------

ArpRequest is a Python module designed to make an ARP gratuitous request
to know if a host is online. It acts on OSI model's level 2 unlike 
icmp echo (ping), so, you can use it without IP configuration, or to 
"ping" an host in other IP network. However, you can only use it on
local networks.

Usage
-----

>>> from arprequest import ArpRequest
>>> ar = ArpRequest('10.0.0.1', 'eth0')
>>> ar.request()
True
>>> ar2 = ArpRequest('10.0.0.123', 'eth0') # 10.0.0.123 doesen't exist
>>> ar2.request()
False

Constraints
-----------

 - ArpRequest work only on unix or unix-like platforms because it uses
   unix signals.
 - ArpRequest work only as root, because it uses raw sockets.
 - Module is commented in french. I will translate comments in english,
   a day...
