Description: ArpRequest
        ==========
        
        General
        -------
        
        ArpRequest is a Python module designed to make an ARP gratuitous request
        to know if a host is online. It acts on OSI model's level 2 unlike
        icmp echo (ping), so, you can use it without IP configuration, or to
        "ping" an host in other IP network. However, you can only use it on
        local networks.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        >>> from arprequest import ArpRequest
        >>> ar = ArpRequest('10.0.0.1', 'eth0')
        >>> ar.request()
        True
        >>> ar2 = ArpRequest('10.0.0.123', 'eth0') # 10.0.0.123 doesen't exist
        >>> ar2.request()
        False
        
        Changelog
        ---------
        
        0.3 :
        
        - You can now select type of ARP request. This is done with "arp_type"
        argument of ArpRequest class. You can use arprequest.ARP_GRATUITOUS
        to make an ARP Gratuitous request (what is currently done) or use
        arprequest.ARP_STANDARD to do a standard ARP request.
        
        This option was created to use this library with systems which are
        configured to block Arp Gratuitous.
        
        Constraints
        -----------
        
        - ArpRequest work only on unix or unix-like platforms because it uses
        unix signals.
        - ArpRequest work only as root, because it uses raw sockets.
        - Module is commented in french. I will translate comments in english,
        a day...
