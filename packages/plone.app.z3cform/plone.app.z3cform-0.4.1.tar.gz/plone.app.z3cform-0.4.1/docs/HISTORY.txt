Changelog
=========

0.4.1 - 2008-08-21
------------------

* Removed maximum version dependency on zope.component. This should be left
  to indexes, known good sets or explicit version requirements in buildouts.
  If you work with zope.component >= 3.5 you will also need five.lsm >= 0.4.

* Make use of new plone.z3cform support for looking up the layout template by
  adapter. This means that forms now no longer need to depend on
  plone.app.z3cform unless they want to use Plone-specific widgets.

0.4.0 - 2008-07-31
------------------

* Add inline validation support with KSS

* Require zope.component <= 3.4.0 to prevent compatibility issues with
  five.localsitemanager, of which a buggy version (0.3) is pinned by
  plone.recipe.plone 3.1.4.  Upgrade to this version if you're seeing::
    ...
      Module five.localsitemanager.registry, line 176, in registeredUtilities
    ValueError: too many values to unpack

0.3.2 - 2008-07-25
------------------

* Fixed a bug in macros.pt where 'has_groups' and 'show_default_label'
  for fieldsets were set in the 'form' macro, rendering the 'field'
  macro unusable by itself.

0.3.1 - 2008-07-24
------------------

* Fixed a bug where we would use the form macros defined in
  plone.z3cform instead of our own.

0.3 - 2008-07-24
----------------

* Create this package from Plone-specific bits that have been factored
  out of plone.z3cform.
