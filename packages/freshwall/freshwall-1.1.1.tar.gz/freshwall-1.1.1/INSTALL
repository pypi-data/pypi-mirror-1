REQUIREMENTS
============

Core functionality:
  Python 2.x >= 2.4 (not 3.0+ at the moment)
  Python GConf bindings

Preferences window and daemon mode:
  GTK+ >= 2.6
  PyGTK >= 2.6

Also needed for daemon mode:
	Python DBus bindings >= 0.80

The Python GConf bindings are in the python-gconf package on Debian/Ubuntu/etc.
and gnome-python2-gconf on Fedora. PyGTK is in the python-gtk2 package on
Debian/Ubuntu/etc. and pygtk2 on Fedora. The dbus-python bindings are in the
python-dbus package for Debian/Ubuntu/etc. and dbus-python on Fedora.

Ubuntu appears to have all these packages installed by default starting in
version 7.10 (Gutsy).


INSTALLATION
============

This code uses the standard distutils method of installation:

	$ python setup.py install

This will install the main program as /usr/bin/freshwall, and place its
necessary modules into the Python site-packages/freshwall directory.

You can then run it to change the wallpaper, set preferences, launch the
daemon, or shut down the daemon:

	$ freshwall
	$ freshwall --preferences
	$ freshwall --daemon
	$ freshwall --exit-daemon

Of course, freshwall understands --help as well.
