Background
==========

Pyonewire is a set of modules for working with OneWire busses and devices.

The project currently provides a userspace driver for the DS2490 OneWire master
adapter, which uses the usermode libusb library. Much of the initial code
structure is derived from the Linux kernel w1 driver tree, with obvious changes
where python or OO features make them possible.

Why pyonewire?
==============

The basic dependencies of this module -- libusb and Python -- are available on a
variety of platforms. My original goal was to access to OneWire devices from
various Python programs on Linux and non-Linux platforms.

Installation Instructions
=========================

  $ python setup.py install

You may need to run this command with root privileges.
