Pudge TODO list:

 * Use is_alias to determine whether a class really belongs to a module.
   Don't generate documentation for alias classes, just link to the
   canonical.
   
 * Enhanced link resolution. I'd like to be assemble a big dictionary of
   possible link targets that could be referenced from rst documentation
   (docstrings or external doc). Targets would include modules, classes,
   functions, methods, as well as the titles of documents (perhaps even
   section titles?).
   
 * External link resolution. Once enhanced link resolution is completed
   it should be possible to then dump out a single file containing all
   link targets for the documentation set. When generating documentation
   for other packages, the URL to the link target file could be provided
   so that documentation sets could cross reference each other.
   
 * Class MRO and __metaclass__. Not sure what the best way to handle this
   will be. Perhaps just links to each class in the MRO and the metaclass
   with notes on the relationship.
 
 * Need some way of picking up comments on attributes. Actually, attributes
   are horribly documented right now. The name of the attribute is listed
   but that's it.
   
 * Link to test cases from normal documentation if possible.

 * Would be cool if we could hide doc comments in source if we pass a parm
   or something.

 * Source should get be wrapped in normal layout I think..

 * nameparser should use the parser module instead of a re based scanner.
