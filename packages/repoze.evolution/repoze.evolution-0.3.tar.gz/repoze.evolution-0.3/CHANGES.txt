0.3 (2009-12-03)
----------------

- Remove unncessary assignment.

- ``repoze.evolution`` no longer attempts to construe implicitly the version of
  a database for which no version has been set explicitly.  Previously, an
  unversioned database was construed to already be at the software version.
  The ``ZODBEvolutionManager`` performed a write on read, setting the database
  version to the software when ``get_db_version()`` was called.  The
  constructor for ``ZODBEvolutionManager`` now accepts an optional argument,
  ``initial_db_version``, which specificies the version a database should be
  considered to be if it does not already have a version set.  The default
  value is ``None``.  If a database has not already been marked to be at a
  particular version, ``get_db_version()`` will return the initial database
  version value.  If this is ``None``, attempts to call ``evolve_to_latest()``
  will fail with a ``ValueError``.  This represents a backwards incompatible
  change, as databases for which no initial version is supplied explicitly will
  now fail to evolve.

- Added new public method, ``set_db_version()`` to IEvolutionManager interface.
