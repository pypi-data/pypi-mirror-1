Pyndexter (pronounced 'poindexter') is an abstraction layer for full-text
indexing engines. It presents a uniform query syntax to the user, includes a
basic but functional pure-Python indexer, and has adapters for Hype,
Hyperestraier, Lucene, Lupy, Pyndex, Swish-e and Xapian.

Here's a 9 line micro-tutorial:

	import os
	from pyndexter import Framework

	framework = Framework('builtin:///tmp/pyndexter.idx')
	framework.add_source('file:///usr/share/doc?include=*.txt&include=*.html')
	framework.update()

	for hit in framework.search('linux or windows'):
	    print hit

	framework.close()
