        under subversion.
        
        An application is seen as a products suite defined using subversion
        svn:externals property. An application is a bundle of products. Products are
        versioned piece of software.
        
        Releasing an application is about taking care of tagging the source
        repository, managing version of each products, managing CHANGELOGs, creating
        a source package archive, giving ways to maitain a release without blocking
        the trunk development.
