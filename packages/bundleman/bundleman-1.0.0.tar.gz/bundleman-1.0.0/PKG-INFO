        under subversion.
        
        An application is a products suite defined using subversion
        svn:externals property. An application is a bundle of products.
        
        A product is just a versioned piece of software.
        
        Releasing an application is about taking care of tagging the source
        repository, managing version of each products, managing CHANGELOG, creating
        a source package archive, giving ways to maitain a release without blocking
        the trunk development.
