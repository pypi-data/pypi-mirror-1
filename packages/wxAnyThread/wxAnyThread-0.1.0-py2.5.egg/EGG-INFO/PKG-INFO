        wxAnyThread:  allow methods on wxPython objects to be called from any thread
        
        In wxPython, methods that alter the state of the GUI are only safe to call from
        the thread running the main event loop.  Other threads must typically post
        events to the GUI thread instead of invoking methods directly.
        
        This module provides an easy way to invoke wxPython object methods safely
        from any thread.  Basically, the standard event-based solution is wrapped
        into a decorator named "anythread", which can be applied to methods to make
        them safe to call from any thread, like so:
        
        class MyFrame(wx.Frame):
        
        @anythread
        def ShowFancyStuff():
        ...does some GUI manipulation...
        
        The ShowFancyStuff method can now be directly invoked from any thread.
        The thread will block while the main GUI thread performs the method.
