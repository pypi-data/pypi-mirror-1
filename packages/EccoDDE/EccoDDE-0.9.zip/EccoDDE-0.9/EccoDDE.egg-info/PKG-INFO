Description: EccoDDE is a very thin wrapper over the DDE API of the Ecco Pro personal
        information manager for Windows.  Unlike other Python interfaces to Ecco,
        it does not provide any higher-level objects to represent items, folders, etc.,
        but instead permits you to create whatever higher-level objects suit your own
        particular application.
        
        Also, EccoDDE uses the original Ecco API names for its methods, so that you can
        use the Ecco API reference as a rough guide to EccoDDE.  Some methods have
        enhanced functionality that you can access by using different argument types,
        but even these are nearly always just exposing capabilities of the underlying
        Ecco API, rather than doing any Python-specific wrapping.  48 of Ecco's 49 API
        calls are implemented.  (The 49th, ``AddFileToMenu``, does not have appear to
        be documented anywhere on the 'net.)
        
        The main value-add that EccoDDE provides over writing your own ad-hoc interface
        is robustness.  EccoDDE can transparently launch Ecco if it's not started, and
        it avoids many subtle quoting and line-termination problems that you'd run into
        when writing an interface from scratch.  EccoDDE also has an automated test
        suite, so that any future additions to the library won't break current
        functionality.
        
        This library requires the PyWin32 package, but does not automatically install
        it, due to it not being compatible with easy_install at this time.  You must
        manually install PyWin32 before using EccoDDE.

        guide`_.  Questions, comments, and bug reports for this package should be
