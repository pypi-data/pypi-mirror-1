Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Ploneboard is an easy to use web board. It utilizes the proven Plone user
        interface, and is made for easy integration into Plone sites. The target
        audience is businesses and developers wanting a discussion board in their
        Plone site.
        
        Ploneboard aims to do one thing, and do it well. It will never be an
        over-the-top all-bells-and-whistles message board, but will stay minimal in the
        sense that it's living inside an existing content management system - and will
        leverage that to the fullest extent possible.
        
        Visit Ploneboard_ in the products area on `plone.org`_ for more information.
        
        Ploneboard is sponsored by `the Consumer Council of Norway`_,
        `Marshall Mayer, LiveModern`_ and various generous contributors

        Requirements
        ------------
        
        Ploneboard requires:
        
        * Plone 3.0 or later
        * SimpleAttachment_
        
        
        .. _SimpleAttachment: http://plone.org/products/simpleattachment
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        See the `Installing an Add-on Product`_ tutorial for more detailed product installation instructions.
        
        .. _Installing an Add-on Product: http://plone.org/documentation/tutorial/third-party-products/installing
        
        
        
        Installing with buildout
        ------------------------
        
        If you are using `buildout`_ to manage your instance installing Ploneboard
        is very simple. You can install it by adding it to the eggs line for your
        instance::
        
        [instance]
        eggs = Products.Ploneboard
        
        
        If another egg package depends on Products.Ploneboard you do not need
        to specify anything in the buildout configuration: buildout will detect this
        automatically.
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run the ''bin/buildout'', which
        will take care of updating your system.
        
        .. _buildout: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout
        
        Installing without buildout
        ---------------------------
        
        You can install Ploneboard easily using the easy_install command from
        setuptools; this will install both Ploneboard and SimpleAttachment. You can
        install this in either the system python path or in the lib/python directory
        of your Zope instance. If you have setuptools installed you can do this
        using easy_install::
        
        easy_install Products.Ploneboard
        
        If you do not have setuptools you can install both manually by using the
        setup.py script in the SimpleAttachment and Ploneboard sources. If you want
        to install SimpleAttachment inside your Zope instance instead of system wide
        you can its ''--prefix='' option to install in the ''lib/python'' directory
        of your Zope instance.
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        2.1 - Unreleased
        ----------------
        
        
        2.0 - March 14, 2008
        --------------------
        
        - Index newly added comments so all their data is correct in the catalog.
        [wichert]
        
        - Rework the RSS feed: make the Ploneboard RSS feed work recursively so
        a feed on a forum shows all conversations and a feed on the board itself
        shows all comments from all fora. Enabled feeds on the Ploneboard type.
        [wichert]
        
        - Remove the object_provides index from Ploneboard: Plone 3.0 has a much
        more efficient version of that itself.
        [wichert]
        
        - Add an explicit visualClear below the 'start new conversation' button
        so it does not overlap the table. This fixes
        http://plone.org/products/ploneboard/issues/161
        [wichert]
        
        - In preparation of PLIP195 being merged for Plone 3.1: declare
        Products.SimpleAttachment as a dependency in our GS profile.
        [wichert]
        
        _ Update the Lithuanian translation. This fixes
        http://plone.org/products/ploneboard/issues/164
        [wichert]
        
        - Correct the attachment size vocabulary: the values should be integers,
        not strings. This fixes http://plone.org/products/ploneboard/issues/168
        as well as http://plone.org/products/ploneboard/issues/144
        [wichert]
        
        - Honour the content-type for comments when transforming them. Doing things
        like replacing newlines with <br/> on text/html comments is kind of silly.
        [wichert].
        
        
        2.0rc1 - December 21, 2007
        --------------------------

        http://plone.org/products/ploneboard/issues/78
        [wichert]
        
        - Fix a corner case: creating a conversation without text but with attachments
        would loose the attachments.
        [wichert]
        
        - When creating a new conversation do not set its description to the
        entered text.
        [wichert]
        
        - Switch to a plone.app.controlpanel based control panel.
        [wichert]

        http://plone.org/products/ploneboard/issues/154
        [wichert]

        - Correct login-name vs userid usage.
