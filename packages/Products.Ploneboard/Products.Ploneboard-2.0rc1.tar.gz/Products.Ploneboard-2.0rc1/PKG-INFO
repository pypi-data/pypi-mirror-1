Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Ploneboard is an easy to use web board. It utilizes the proven Plone user
        interface, and is made for easy integration into Plone sites. The target
        audience is businesses and developers wanting a discussion board in their
        Plone site.
        
        Ploneboard aims to do one thing, and do it well. It will never be an
        over-the-top all-bells-and-whistles message board, but will stay minimal in the
        sense that it's living inside an existing content management system - and will
        leverage that to the fullest extent possible.
        
        Visit Ploneboard_ in the products area on `plone.org`_ for more information.
        
        Ploneboard is sponsored by `the Consumer Council of Norway`_,
        `Marshall Mayer, LiveModern`_ and various generous contributors

        Installation
        ============
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        Ploneboard requires Zope 2.10.4, Plone 3.0.x or later.
        
        SimpleAttachment is required to handle attachments in comments.
        
        Installing with buildout
        ------------------------
        
        If you are using `buildout`_ to manage your instance installing Ploneboard
        is even simpler. You can install it by adding it to the eggs line for your
        instance::
        
        [instance]
        eggs = Products.Ploneboard
        
        
        If another egg package depends on Products.Ploneboard you do not need
        to specify anything in the buildout configuration: buildout will detect this
        automatically.
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run the ''bin/buildout'', which
        will take care of updating your system.
        
        .. _buildout: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout
        
        Installing without buildout
        ---------------------------
        
        You can install Ploneboard easily using the easy_install command from
        setuptools; this will install both Ploneboard and SimpleAttachment. You can
        install this in either the system python path or in the lib/python directory
        of your Zope instance. If you have setuptools installed you can do this
        using easy_install::
        
        easy_install Products.Ploneboard
        
        If you do not have setuptools you can install both manually by using the
        setup.py script in the SimpleAttachment and Ploneboard sources. If you want
        to install SimpleAttachment inside your Zope instance instead of system wide
        you can its ''--prefix='' option to install in the ''lib/python'' directory
        of your Zope instance.
