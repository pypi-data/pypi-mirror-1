This package contains an annotation adapter for Zope 3 content objects
that allows one to rate objects.  The adapter (including a viewlet
that comes with it) originally appeared in the World Cookery
application, the demo application for Philipp von Weitershausen's book
"Web Component Development with Zope 3" (http://worldcookery.com).
