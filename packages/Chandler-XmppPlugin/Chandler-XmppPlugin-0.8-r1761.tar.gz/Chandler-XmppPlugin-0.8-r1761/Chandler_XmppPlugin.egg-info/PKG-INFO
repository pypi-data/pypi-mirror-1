Description: This plugin provides support for XMPP in Chandler.
        
        NOTE: This plugin is extremely experimental and it is not recommended you use
        this inside a Chandler with data you care about.
        
        What it does:
        
        Once you have installed the plugin, the File > Accounts dialog will have a
        new account type, "XMPP / Jabber".  You can create an account of this type
        and from now on, any XMPP message that arrives will be added as an event to
        a collection named "XMPP" (which will get automatically created in the sidebar).
        
        Eventually, this plugin will allow other plugins to register to handle
        incoming messages.
        
        To download and install the plugin from the Chandler UI,
        use the "Plugins -> Download" and "Plugins -> Install" menus.
        
        To download and install the plugin from the command line, use Chandler's
        InstallPlugin script and restart Chandler::
        
        InstallPlugin Chandler-XmppPlugin
        
        If you want to work on its code, you can use::
        
        RunPython setup.py develop
        
        to install it in development mode (where you can make changes and have them
        take effect whenever Chandler is restarted), or you can use::
        
        RunPython setup.py install
        
        to install it as an ``.egg`` file.
        
        Note that when installed as an egg file, changes made to the source code will
        not affect Chandler execution, until you run ``setup.py install`` or ``setup.py
        develop`` again.
        
        After making changes to this plugin, you should update its version number in
        ``setup.py`` and in the chandler/Makefile, so that people using "quick builds"
        of Chandler will use your new version.
        
        If you want to run this plugin's tests use::
        
        RunPython setup.py test
