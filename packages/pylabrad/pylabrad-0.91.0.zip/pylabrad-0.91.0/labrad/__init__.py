You can create an alias name for your server using:

To get information about the server just type its name:
    <Server>   or
    <Connection>.<Server Name>

To get information about a setting type:
    <Server>.<Setting>

To execute requests use
    <Server>.<Setting> (<Parameters>)

the hostname of the computer where the manager is running.

>>> cxn = labrad.connect(host='localhost')

assign it to the variable 'cxn'.  Through this variable you can
find out about and talk to labrad servers.
