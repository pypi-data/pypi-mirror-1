0.4: released 2009-06-11
------------------------
 - Small fixes in documentation: actually Tropashko was not the
   first who introduced MP, he only promoted it.
 - Implemented ``MPClassManager.query_all_trees()``
 - Fixed a bug of ``MPClassManager.rebuild_all_trees()`` did not
   reset path for root nodes.
 - Implemented ``tree_recursive_iterator()``
 - Changed the value of path field for a root nodes. Previously
   they used to had ``'0' * steplen`` path and so first-level
   children gain ``'0' * steplen * 2``, but now new roots will
   have an ampty string in their path field. This change should
   be backward-compatible as it touches only new trees. But
   if you want to have no difference between two identical old
   and new trees in your table you can rebuild all your trees
   by ``Node.mp.rebuild_all_trees()`` or use sql query like
   this::

      UPDATE <table> SET mp_path = substr(mp_path, <steplen> + 1);

   This will remove ``steplen`` characters from the beginning
   of each node's path. **Do not forget to backup your data!**
