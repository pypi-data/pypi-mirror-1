Description: Simple library for parsing messages of Health Level 7 (HL7)
        version 2.x.
        
        HL7 is a communication protocol and message format for
        health care data. It is the de facto standard for transmitting data
        between clinical information systems and between clinical devices.
        The version 2.x series, which is often is a pipe delimited format
        is currently the most widely accepted version of HL7 (version 3.0
        is an XML-based format).
        
        python-hl7 currently only parses HL7 version 2.x messages into
        an easy to access data structure. The current implementation
        does not complete follow the HL7 specification, but is good enough
        to parse the most commonly seen HL7 messages. The library could
        potentially evolution into being fully complainant with the spec.
        The library could eventually also contain the ability to create
        HL7 v2.x messages
