        Pygments is a syntax highlighting package written in Python.
        
        It aims to be a generic syntax highlighter for general use in all
        kinds of software such as forum systems, wikis or other applications
        that need to prettify source code. Highlights are:
        
        * a wide range of common languages and markup formats is supported
        * special attention is paid to details, increasing quality by a fair amount
        * support for new languages and formats are added easily
        * a number of output formats, presently HTML, LaTeX and ANSI sequences
        * it is usable as a command-line tool and as a library
        * ... and it highlights even Brainfuck!
