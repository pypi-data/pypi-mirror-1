Description: z3c.listjs
        **********
        
        z3c.listjs contains a widget called ``ListJsWidget`` that is a drop-in
        replacement for the ``zope.app.form.browser.ListSequenceWidget``. It
        allows users to add and remove list items without the need for server
        interaction, using Javascript.
        
        Note: This package only works with ``zope.formlib``
        (``zope.app.form``) and is not compatible with ``z3c.form``.
        
        You can use ``ListJsWidget`` for any ``schema.List`` field using the
        normal ``zope.formlib`` custom widget pattern::
        
        from z3c.listjs import ListJsWidget
        
        ...
        
        form_fields['foo'].custom_widget = ListJsWidget
        
        With the right ZCML override it should also be possible to
        automatically use this widget in all cases ``ListSequenceWidget``
        would normally be used. Documentation contributions are welcome!
        
        Should you wish to override the CSS for the buttons, the CSS classes
        are ``up_button`` and ``down_button``. If you are using hurry.resource
        for your overriding CSS, your resource should depend on
        ``z3c.listjs.listjs_css`` so that ordering is correct to make the
        override happen.
        
        CHANGES
        *******
        
        1.0b1 (2009-06-04)
        ==================
        
        * Javascript in ``<script>`` blocks and ``onclick`` handlers are also
        renumbered so that references to the element id in question are
        updated. This won't be reliable in the (assumed to uncommon) case
        where a widget id is referenced within the HTML that is *not* the
        field of the widget being rendered.
        
        * If TinyMCE is installed, care is taken to disconnect TinyMCE editors
        before moving. Reconnection of the moved editors is assumed to take
        place in the included HTML for the new element, using something
        like::
        
        tinyMCE.execCommand('mceAddControl', false, 'id_of_element');
        
        * A few small bugfixes:
        
        * prefix is passed along to update_numbers
        
        * ``attr`` is a local as it should be.
        
        * ``getElementsByClassName`` actually filters by class name.
        
        1.0a4 (2008-02-04)
        ==================
        
        * Really fixed up/down arrow for added items.
        
        1.0a3 (2009-02-03)
        ==================

        1.0a2 (2009-01-23)
        ==================
