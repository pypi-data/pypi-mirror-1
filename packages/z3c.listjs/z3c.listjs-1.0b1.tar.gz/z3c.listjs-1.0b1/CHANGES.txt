1.0b1 (2009-06-04)
==================

* Javascript in ``<script>`` blocks and ``onclick`` handlers are also
  renumbered so that references to the element id in question are
  updated. This won't be reliable in the (assumed to uncommon) case
  where a widget id is referenced within the HTML that is *not* the
  field of the widget being rendered.

* If TinyMCE is installed, care is taken to disconnect TinyMCE editors
  before moving. Reconnection of the moved editors is assumed to take
  place in the included HTML for the new element, using something
  like::

    tinyMCE.execCommand('mceAddControl', false, 'id_of_element');

* A few small bugfixes:

  * prefix is passed along to update_numbers

  * ``attr`` is a local as it should be.

  * ``getElementsByClassName`` actually filters by class name.
