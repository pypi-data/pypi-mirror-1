Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        ZopeSkel provides a collection of skeletons for quickstarting Zope
        and Plone projects.
        
        All skeletons are available as PasteScript_ templates and can be used
        via the ''paster'' commandline tool. For example to create a package
        for a Plone 3 theme you can do::
        
        paster create -t plone3_theme
        
        this will ask a few questions such as desired package name and a description
        and output a complete package skeleton that you can immediately start using.
        
        Please contribute by submitting patches for what you consider 'best of
        breed' file layouts for starting Zope projects.

        Available templates
        ===================
        
        Development templates
        ---------------------
        plone
        This is a small template which creates a bare bones package with a
        single namespace. This can be used to create plone.* packages
        for example.
        
        plone_app
        This is a small template which creates a bare bones package with a
        nested namespace. This can be used to create plone.app.* packages
        for example.
        
        plone3_portlet
        Creates a package with a new portlet. This includes everything needed
        to register the portlet in Plone and tests which check if the portlet can
        be added, edited and rendered properly.
        
        plone2_theme
        A template to create a new Zope 2 products for a Plone 2.1 or Plone 2.5
        site. If you are targetting Plone 3 please use the plone3_theme template
        instead.
        
        plone2.5_theme
        A template to create a new Zope 2 products for Plone 2.5
        site. If you are targetting Plone 3 please use the plone3_theme template
        instead.
        
        plone3_theme
        This template creates a theme package for Plone 3.0. This is the succesor
        to the popular DIYPloneStyle_ product.
        
        recipe
        This template creates a recipe skeleton for zc.buildout.

        Hosting / deployment templates
        ------------------------------
        
        plone2.5_buildout
        A basic buildout_ based instance for Plone 2.5 projects. If you also need
        ZEO or caching take a look at the plone_hosting template.
        
        plone3_buildout
        A basic buildout_ based instance for Plone 3.0.x projects. If you also need
        ZEO or caching take a look at the plone_hosting template.
        
        plone_hosting
        This template creates a buildout_-based Plone deployment. It supports
        all Plone 2.5 and 3.0 versions: it will ask you for the desired Plone
        version.
        
        If you configure a proxy port a varnish_ cache server will be installed
        and configured as well.
        
        To manage the ZEO server, Zope instance and, if chosen, Varnish server
        a simple ''bin/control'' script is created which can be used to quickly
        start, stop and restart the entire Plone deployment.
        
        silva_buildout
        A basic buildout Silva instance.

        .. _varnish: http://varnish.projects.linpro.no
        
        
        Testing
        -------
        
        Since version 1.5, ZopeSkel has tests.  It's required to run these
        before checking in; they can be run like::
        
        $ python setup.py test
        
        You can also set a test environment using the buildout bootstrap::
        
        $ python boostrap.py
        $ bin/buildout
        
        You will then have a `test` script available::
        
        $ bin/test
        
        You can even run just one test::
        
        $ bin/test -t silva_buildout
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        Version 1.8 (UNRELEASED)
        ------------------------
        
        * fixed the recipe template buildout.cfg generation, thanks Kai ;)
        [tarek]
        
        Version 1.7
        -----------
        
        * Update the templates to have README.txt and HISTORY.txt in valid
        restructured format and use those as the package's long description.
        This automatically gives packages a more readable page on PyPI
        (and PSC with Tarek's excellent changes).
        [wichert]
        
        * Adjust the trove classifiers on the packages to not claim incorrect
        frameworks: we should only claim frameworks on which the package
        can run directly. So, for example, do not claim Zope2 of we also need
        Plone on top of Zope2.
        [wichert]
        
        
        Version 1.6
        -----------
        
        * Add templates for a Silva buildout.
        [thefunny]
        
        * Add a metadata.xml to all generated GenericSetup profiles. This is
        required by new versions of GenericSetup.
        [wichert]
        
        * For nested namespace packages we need to declare both namespace
        levels as namespace packages. This is a requirement for current
        versions of setuptools.
        [wichert]
        
        * Use Plone 3.0.6 as default version for new Plone hosting buildouts
        [wichert]
        
        
        Version 1.5.1
        -------------
        
        * Fix #2 (missing import in 'hosting.py') at
        http://plone.org/products/zopeskel/issues/2
        [nouri]
        
        Version 1.5
        -----------
        
        * added a new local command into archetype template to inject
        new content types [spanky]
        
        * added a doctest for each template, and refactored the package
        so we have one python module per template [tarek]
        
        * Refactored the zc.buildout recipe to provide structured documention
        that will render nicely on PyPI, added comments for recipe authors
        to help writing documentation and tests and added a working doctest
        skeleton. Implemented automatic license classifiers for common
        licenses in the generated setup.py. The mapping is in zopeskel.base
        and can be used for other templates also.
        [dokai]
        
        * The 'five:registerPackage' ZCML directive is added in a project based on the
        'plone' template only if the top level namespace package is not
        called 'Products'. This avoids having the product loaded twice in Zope.
        [davconvent]
        
        * Added paragraph about old style Zope 2 Product installation in the
        INSTALL.txt_tmpl file of the plone template.
        The paragraph will be added to the installation instructions if the top
        level namespace package is called 'Products'.
        [davconvent]
        
        Version 1.4
        -----------
        
        * Set the version number for plone.recipe.plone in a new versions part in
        buildout.cfg. That works around a buildout bug: buildout breaks if you change
        the revision pin for a recipe.
        [wichert]
        
        * Fixed bug: when running 'paster create' with --no-interactive option,
        the package variable given in the command line is ignored.
        [Mustapha]
        
        Version 1.3.4
        -------------
        
        * Added MANIFEST.in to prevent bad releases from svn exports.
        [fschulze]
        
        Version 1.3.3
        -------------
        
        * Move to the newly released Varnish 1.1.2.
        [wichert]
        
        * Remove bad import which broke localcommand support.
        [deo]
        
        * Remove unneeded imports and whitespace cleanup.
        [deo]
        
        Version 1.3.2
        -------------
        
        * Small fix in plone3_theme that did not install correctly with easy_install
        because of some files missing the the egg informations (added MANIFEST.in).
        [davconvent]
        
        Version 1.3.1
        -------------
        
        * Added 'addcontent' local command to make possible injecting content types
        in ZopeSkel projects and make the Archetype template 'addcontent' aware.
        [mustapha]
        
        * Updated to Plone 3.0.4.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Rerelease because of a bad egg.
        [fschulze]
        
        Version 1.3
        -----------
        
        * added the `recipe` template
        [tarek]
        
        * Add Plone 2.5.5.
        [wichert]
        
        Version 1.2
        -----------
        
        * Merge a slightly stripped down version of the Jarn Plone hosting template.
        This provides a convenient way to create a buildout for all Plone 2.5 and
        3.0 versions with ZEO and optional Varnish based caching.
