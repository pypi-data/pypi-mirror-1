ZopeSkel README
===============

A collection of skeletons for quickstarting Zope projects.

This package adds to the list of available `PasteScript
<http://pythonpaste.org/script/>`_ templates a few that are useful for
quickly starting Zope projects that have a `setuptools
<http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools>`_-ready file
layout.

The latest version is available in a `Subversion repository
<http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/ZopeSkel/trunk#egg=ZopeSkel-dev>`_.

Please contribute by submitting patches for what you consider 'best of
breed' file layouts for starting Zope projects.
