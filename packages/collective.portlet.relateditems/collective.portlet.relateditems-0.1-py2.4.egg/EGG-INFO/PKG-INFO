        =================================
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        This is a simple portlet that will display content that has keywords similar to the piece of content you are on.
        
        Options
        -------
        
        The portlet has the following options available to it on the Add screen.
        
        count
        This is the number of recent items that will be shown in the portlet.
        
        states
        The workflow states the items must be in to be shown in the portlet.
        
        allowed_types
        The allowed types to be shown in the portlet and the 'more...' link search
        
        show_all_types
        Choose whether or not all types should be available for the 'more...' link.  This will search for all content types when clicking on 'more...'

        1.2 (2008-10-02)
        ----------------
        
        - Fixed the 'more...' link so that it doesn't show when all the
        possible results are already in the portlet.  If 'show all types'
        is checked then the 'more...' link will always show.
