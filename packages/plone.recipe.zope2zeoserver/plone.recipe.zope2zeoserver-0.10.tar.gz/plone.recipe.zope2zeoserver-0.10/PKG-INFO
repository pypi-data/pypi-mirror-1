Description: plone.recipe.zope2zeoserver
        ===========================
        
        This recipe creates and configures a Zope 2 ZEO server in parts. It also
        installs a control script, which is like zeoctl, in the bin/ directory.
        The name of the control script is the the name of the part in buildout.
        
        You can use it with a part like this::
        
        [zeoserver]
        recipe = plone.recipe.zope2zeoserver
        zope2-location = /path/to/zope2/install
        zeo-address = 8100
        
        Options
        -------
        
        zope2-location
        The path where Zope 2 is installed. If you are also using the
        plone.recipe.zope2install recipe, and you have that configured as a part
        called 'zope2' prior to the zope2zeoserver part, you can use
        ${zope2:location} for this parameter. You must ensure the zope2zeoserver part
        is run *after* the zope2install one.
        
        zeopack
        The path to the zeopack.py backup script. A wrapper for this will be
        generated in bin/zeopack, which sets up the appropriate environment to
        run this. Defaults to "${zope2-location}/utilities/ZODBTools/zeopack.py".
        Set this option to an empty value if you do not want this script to be
        generated.
        
        zeo-conf
        A relative or absolute path to a zeo.conf file. If this is not given, a
        zeo.conf will be generated based on the the options below.
        
        The following options all affect the generated zope.conf.
        
        zeo-address
        Give a port for the ZEO server. Defaults to 8100.
        
        effective-user
        The name of the effective user for the ZEO process. Defaults to not setting
        an effective user.
        
        invalidation-queue-size
        The invalidation-queue-size used for the ZEO server. Defaults to 100.
        
        zeo-log
        The filename of the ZEO log file. Defaults to var/log/${partname}.log
        
        storage-number
        The number used to identify a storage.
        
        file-storage
        The filename where the ZODB data file will be stored.
        Defaults to var/filestorage/Data.fs.
        
        blob-storage
        The folder where the ZODB blob data files will be stored.
        
        socket-name
        The filename where ZEO will write its socket file.
        Defaults to var/zeo.zdsock.
        
        zeo-conf-additional
        Give additional lines to zeo.conf. Make sure you indent any lines after
        the one with the parameter.

        Change History
        ==============
        
        0.10
        ----
        
        - Calculate the package working set outside of the recipe constructor. Closes
        https://bugs.launchpad.net/collective.buildout/+bug/180084
        [rochael]
        
        0.9
        ---
        
        - Added `invalidation-queue-size` and `storage-number` options.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Merged rochael-blobsupport branch. Added support for ZODB 3.8 blob storage
        configuration. This adds the blob-storage option. This closes
        https://bugs.launchpad.net/collective.buildout/+bug/179115 and
        https://bugs.launchpad.net/collective.buildout/+bug/179117.
        [rochael, hannosch]
        
        - Renamed `zope-conf-additional` option to `zeo-conf-additional`.
        [rochael]
        
        0.8
        ---
        
        - Small documentation update. Added link to the bugtracker.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Have PID file's location default to `${buildout:directory}/var/${name}.pid`.
        Keeping the PID file in $INSTANCE_HOME gives trouble when buildout rebuilds
        the part.
        [nouri, mbenali]
        
        0.7
        ---
        
        - Change default location of zeo socket to var.
        [smcmahon]
        
        - Add option to set socket-name.
        [smcmahon]
        
        0.6
        ---
        
        - Move the documentation to a separate README.txt and read that from setup.py.
        [wichert]
        
        - Add a wrapper around zeopack which inserts default options for our ZEO server.
        [wichert]
        
        0.5
        ---
        
        - Added an option to set the effective-user.
        [optilude]
        
        0.3
        ---
        
        - Updated setup.py.
        [optilude]
        
        0.2
        ---
        
        - Similarly, there are some hardcoded dependencies on $INSTANCE_HOME/etc/.
        [optilude]
        
        - Documented options, cleaned up code, and added the ability to use a manual
        zeo.conf.
        [optilude]
        
        - Make this work, at least on OS X and probably unix-like system. It wouldn't
        surprise me if this needs adjustment for Windows in the same way that we do
        in plone.recipe.zope2instance. :-(
        [optilude]
        
        0.1
        ---
        
        - Initial implementation.
