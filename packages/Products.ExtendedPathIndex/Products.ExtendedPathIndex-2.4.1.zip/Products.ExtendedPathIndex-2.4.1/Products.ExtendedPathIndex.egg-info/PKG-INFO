Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This is an index that supports depth limiting, and the ability to build a
        structure usable for navtrees and sitemaps. The actual navtree implementations
        are not (and should not) be in this Product, this is the index implementation
        only.
        
        Assumptions
        ===========
        
        EPI makes an assumption about the catalog and index being in the
        same container as all the content. This makes a lot of sense in a
        Plone setting, but might not work as expected in other scenarios.
        
        A query like ``/plonesite/folder, start_level=0`` is transformed internally to
        ``/folder, start_level=1``. This avoids touching the rather large plonesite set
        which contains reference to all content in your site.
        
        Features
        ========
        
        - Can construct a site map with a single catalog query
        
        - Can construct a navigation tree with a single catalog query
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        ``catalog(path='some/path')``
        search for all objects below some/path (recursive, equivalent to depth = -1)
        
        ``catalog(path={'query' : 'some/path', 'depth' : 0})``
        search for the object with the given path.
        
        ``catalog(path={'query' : 'some/path', 'depth' : 2 )``
        search for all objects below some/path but only down to a depth of 2
        
        ``catalog(path={'query' : 'some/path', 'navtree' : 1 )``
        search for all objects below some/path for rendering a navigation tree. This
        includes all objects below some/path up to a depth of 1 and all parent
        objects.
        
        ``catalog(path={'query' : 'some/path', 'navtree' : 1, 'depth': 0 })``
        search for all objects below some/path for rendering a breadcrumb trail.
        This includes only the parent objects themselves.
        
        ``catalog(path={'query' : 'some/path', 'navtree':1, 'navtree_start':1})``
        search for all objects below some/path for rendering a partial
        navigation tree. This includes all objects below the path but stops
        1 level above the root.  The given path is included, even if it is at a
        lower level in the portal than the start parameter would allow.
        
        ``catalog(path={'query' : 'some/path', 'navtree':1, 'depth':0, 'navtree_start':1})``
        search for all objects below some/path for rendering a partial
        breadcrumb trail. This includes all parents below the path but stops
        1 level above the root.  The given path is included, even if it is at a
        lower level in the portal than the start parameter would allow.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        2.4.1 - September 28, 2008
        --------------------------
        
        - Fix typo in setup.py which broke installation of the egg
        [ree]
        
        
        
        2.4 - September 11, 2006
        ------------------------
        
        - Relaxed a check for path only allowing strings so far. Now we except all
        basestrings. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5617.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Converted log infrastructure to use Python's logging module instead zLOG.
        [hannosch]
        
        2.3 - December 18, 2005
        -----------------------
        
        - Added some extra debug information when an improper path is cataloged.
        [sidnei]
        
        2.2 - October 7, 2005
        ---------------------
        
        - Add seperate index structures on the parent path and the full path of all
        objects.  This significantly improves scaling for navtrees, breadcrumbs,
        and listings.
        [alecm]
        
        - Assume that EPI is used inside same container as content and use relative
        search instead of absolute - basically transforming / plonesite search
        to / search with startlevel set to 1 instead of 0.
        [tesdal]
        
        2.1 - May 20, 2005
        ------------------
        
        - Implement 'indexed_attrs' support for ExtendedPathIndex.
        
        - Prevent navigation tree queries from stopping prematurely if the
        queried-for path does not actually exist in the index, but its parents do.
        
        1.0
        ---
        
        - Path index capable of generating a navigation tree structure from
        cataloged data.
