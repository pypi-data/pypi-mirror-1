Description: This module provides the following features:
        
        * getting a user's tags including tag counts, i.e. her tagging vocabulary
        * getting a url's so-called 'common tags', i.e. the most popular tags
        assigned to user bookmarks of said url, if any (number between 0 and 25)
        * getting the total number of bookmarks for a url, i.e. the number of
        users who have bookmarked the url
        * HTTP proxy support
        
        Note: Only public del.icio.us data will be mined (read below). This means
        that this API does not (yet) provide means to access your private bookmark
        data.
        
        The official del.icio.us API does not provide the functionality mentioned
        above, so this module will query the del.icio.us website directly and
        extract the required information by parsing the HTML code of the resulting
        web pages (a kind of poor man's web mining). The module is able to detect
        IP throttling, which is employed by del.icio.us to temporarily block
        abusive HTTP request behavior, and will raise a custom Python error to
        indicate that. Please be a nice netizen and do not stress the del.icio.us
        service more than necessary.
        
        It is strongly advised that you read the del.icio.us Terms of Use
        before using this Python module. In particular, read section 5
        'Intellectual Property'.
