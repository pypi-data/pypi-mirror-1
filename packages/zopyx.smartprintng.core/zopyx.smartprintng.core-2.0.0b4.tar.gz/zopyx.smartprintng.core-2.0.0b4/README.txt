zopyx.smartprintng.core
=======================

This package contains the refactored code-base of the SmartPrintNG
product for Plone. The former monolithic implementation is broken into 
a three-level architecture (top-down):

- ``zopyx.smartprintng.plone`` - the integration layer with Plone
  (status: not implemented)

- ``zopyx.smartprintng.core`` - the SmartPrintNG backend
  (status: implemented and almost finished)

- ``zopyx.convert2`` - the low-level converter API
  (status: implemented and almost finished)
