Description: Lepton is designed to make complex and beautiful particle effects possible,
        and even easy from Python programs.
        
        Lepton is under development, but even now it has some useful features:
        
        - Native-code core for high-performance particle dynamics and rendering
        - Pluggable particle controllers for specifying particle behavior
        - Two pluggable OpenGL renderers, and two pygame renderers
        - Spacial domains, used to control particle emission and behavior
        - Modular architecture that lets you easily configure and customize the engine
        
        The code includes several examples of how you can use the engine (using
        pyglet, and pygame). Note the engine itself does not depend on any other 3rd-party
        libraries and simply requires the application to setup an OpenGL context in
        order to render particles.
