# 27-Nov-07 ver 0.1
#    first pypi release
#    refactored test cases
#
# 28-Mar-01 ver 0.0,4
#     Use repr() instead of str() inside __str__, because str(long) changed
#     since this was first written (used to produce trailing "L", doesn't
#     now).
#
# 09-May-99 ver 0,0,3
#     Repaired __sub__(FixedPoint, string); was blowing up.
#     Much more careful conversion of float (now best possible).
#     Implemented exact % and divmod.
#
# 14-Oct-98 ver 0,0,2
#     Added int, long, frac.  Beefed up docs.  Removed DECIMAL_POINT
#     and MINUS_SIGN globals to discourage bloating this class instead
#     of writing formatting wrapper classes (or subclasses)
#
# 11-Oct-98 ver 0,0,1
