Known issues with the mkcode program.

* setup.py files that define their own distutils commands, or override
  existing ones, cause a crash.  One example is the Python Imaging
  Library, PIL.

* The ``mk develop`` command can choke upon first invocation when
  there is a new package version.  In the meantime one can fall back
  to the setuptools method.
