CLIPART BROWSER 0.5 ALPHA
=========================

I've packaged the clipart browser using python's setuptools system,
which is supposed to make installation and dependency resolution
easier.  In theory, all you should need to do is run

python setup.py install

to automatically resolve dependencies and install the browser.  If all goes
well, a platform-specific "clipartbrowser" executable visible on your system
path will be generated.  In other words, it will generate "clipartbrowser.exe"
on windows, and "clipartbrowser" on linux, and both should be able to be
executed from the command line.  Regardless, just executing "python browser.py"
should work as well, as long as you have the dependencies met. 

The dependencies are:
  * Python 2.4+
  * PyGTK 2.6+ (which requires GTK+ 2.6)
  * PySqlite (I believe any 2.x version, including sqlite 3+)
    * Python 2.5 includes this
  * lxml 1.0+ (http://codespeak.net/lxml) 
  * pyparsing (http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com)

The first time you run the browser, it will create a new clipart
repository for you and ask if you'd like to load any local clipart
into it.  Typically, you'll want to download a recent release of the
open clipart library, extract it, and then index the topmost
directory.  The clipart is then stored in the repository, and the
files you extracted are no longer needed.  The repository is created
at path "~/.clipartbrowser/images.db".

Note that this is an alpha release, and some features visible in the
UI are not implemented yet, such as copying.  The search syntax is
also not very sophisticated yet... for now, it just searches for one
or more tags joined by "and" "or" or "not".  

The development site for the clipart browser is

Bugs, feature requests, etc. should be filed using the tracking system
available there.
