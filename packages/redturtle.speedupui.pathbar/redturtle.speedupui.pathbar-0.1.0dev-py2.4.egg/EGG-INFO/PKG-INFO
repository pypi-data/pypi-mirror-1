Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The sentence "*Plone is slow*" can open a very big dicussion thread.
        What is ofter true is this: "*Work with Plone UI is slow*".
        
        The Plone interface need the user to click many times to do (or repeat) common tasks.
        This is how the World Wide Web works: click on a link, move to a page, click on another link...
        
        Is clear to all that the presence of Javascript can speed up (sometimes dramatically) the speed
        of working with CMS.
        
        What SpeedUpUI Pathbar does
        ===========================
        
        The common static breadcrumb viewlet of Plone can be replaced with a new one.
        
        Why work with static and poor-of-features links in the pathbar when we can replace those links
        with a command interface, to perform directly common operation on the elements inside the pathbar?
        
        So the pathbar will change in a dropdown menu with inside common operation like:
        
        * View the content (what stardard pathbar viewlet does normally)
        * Edit the content directly
        * Go to *folder_contents* view of the element
        
        All those new features are nothing special right now, but can free the user from performing
        additional clicks.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Just register redturtle.speedupui.pathbar in your buildout *.cfg* file.
        
        ::
        
        [instance]
        ...
        eggs =
        ...
        redturtle.speedupui.pathbar
        ...

        TODO
        ====
        
        * Make possible to **add new portal content** directly from the pathbar
        * Check user **permissions** (for edit, see folder contents, ...)
        * Dropdown are now done using basic Plone javascript; think about relying on jQuery Tools
        (plone.app.jqtools)
        * Memus don't work exactly like the basic dropdown ones. For some reason they don't close
        automatically
        * No test with Internet Explorer done right now!
