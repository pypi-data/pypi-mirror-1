Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The sentence "*Plone is slow*" can open a very big dicussion thread (and is commonly *false*!).
        What is often true is this: "*Work with Plone UI is slow*".
        
        The Plone interface need the user to click many times to do (or repeat) common tasks.
        This is how the World Wide Web works: click on a link, move to a page, click on another link...
        
        Is clear to all that the presence of Javascript can speed up (sometimes dramatically) the speed
        of working with CMS.
        
        What SpeedUpUI Pathbar does
        ===========================
        
        The common static breadcrumb viewlet of Plone can be replaced with a new one.
        
        Why work with static and poor-of-features links in the pathbar when we can replace those links
        with a command interface, to perform directly common operation on the elements inside the pathbar?
        
        So the pathbar will change in a dropdown menu with inside common operation like:
        
        * View the content (what stardard pathbar viewlet does normally)
        * Edit the content directly
        * Go to *folder_contents* view of the element
        * Add new content inside the pathbar element, as you are inside the element itself where you
        can normally use the "Add new ..." menu.
        
        All those new features are nothing special right now, but can free the user from performing
        additional clicks.

        TODO
        ====
        
        * Dropdown are now done using basic Plone javascript; think about relying on jQuery Tools
        (plone.app.jqtools)
        * No test with Internet Explorer done right now!
        * Think about add some Manager action (like */manage*, */manage_security*) but inside submenu
        to keep clean the current UI
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.2.0alpha (2009-09-12)
        -----------------------
        
        * Added real permission checking on "*Edit*" and "*Contents*" commands
        * Is now possible to *add new portal content* directly from the pathbar
        * Fixed the non-closing-bug; unique ids for every menu was missing (as is
        indicated in dropdown.js doc string)
        * Changed the pathbar separator for more usability. The arrowdown character
        is a know "click-me" element of Plone UI
