"""babtools_gnutella - Example structure for babtools.
 

Usage: 
 - babscript.py 
  
   for default usage, or 
   
 - babscript.py --help
   
   for getting help
  

Examples: 
  - babscript.py
    
    Print the help message, since we have nothing else to do right now. 


Plans: 
  - None. At the moment I'm happy with this structure.


Ideas: 
  - Adding information, how to use Mercurial to use this structure in your own project and keep it up to date while keeping your changes.
