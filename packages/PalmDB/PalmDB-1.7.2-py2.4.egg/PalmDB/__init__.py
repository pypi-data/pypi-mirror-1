"""PRC/PDB file I/O in pure Python.

    This module allows access to Palm OS(tm) database files on the desktop 
    in pure Python. It is as simple as possible without (hopefully) being 
    too simple. As much as possible Python idioms have been used to make
    it easier to use and more versatile.
