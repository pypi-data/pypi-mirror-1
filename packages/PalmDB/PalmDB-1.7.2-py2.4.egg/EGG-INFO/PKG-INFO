Description: 
        This module allows access to Palm OS(tm) database files on the desktop
        in pure Python.
        This version is an almost complete rewrite of the original library to
        use plugins to read/write specific formats. It also uses plugins to
        read/write XML representations of the PDB. Hooks are provided to use
        XSLT conversions to go to application specific formats.
        Really, the only XML conversion that works completely is Palm Progect,
        but a (untested) sample Todo database plugin has been provided.
        Work is continuing, and I hope to provide plugins for the standard
        Palm databases, either written by other people or by myself over time.
        *Any* database will be converted to XML, but the application specific
        data will remain opaque, by providing a plugin you can turn the opaque
        data into something useful.
