Description: A Python client for accessing Google Analytics data
        ===================================================
        
        Not much info here but I'm working off the documentation [here](http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/gdata/gdataDeveloperGuide.html)
        
        ### Credentials ###
        
        You should put your Google Credentials in a file in your home directory called `.pythongoogleanalytics`. This is a ini style config file and should look like this:
        
        <pre>
        [Credentials]
        google_account_email = youraccount@gmail.com
        google_account_password = yourpassword
        </pre>
        
        If you want to take full advantage of the test suite, you'll need to add another section with a few valid profile IDs from the account you're testing.  Add these as follows:
        
        <pre>
        [Accounts]
        test_profile_ids = 28192 1928329 1029
        </pre>
        
        If you don't add these, we can't really test any future data pulling, and some of the account stuff.  In the future perhaps we can build a list of accounts from get_all_accounts and proceed that way.
        
        ### Installation ###
        
        Theoretically you should be able to type the following after checking out the source:
        
        `sudo python setup.py install`
        
        ### Development ###
        
        I'm trying to use Buildout, so you can start helping out with development by checking out the source and typing the following:
        
        `python bootstrap.py && ./bin/buildout`
        
        Run tests as follows:
        
        `./bin/test`
        
        Most of the action is in `googleanalytics.connection` for the moment.
        
        ### Usage ###
        
        Check out the `tests.py` file for details on how to use the library.  There's not much here at the moment.
        
        If it's not obvious I've modeled a lot of of what I've done so far off the [Boto Amazon Web Services client](http://code.google.com/p/boto/).
