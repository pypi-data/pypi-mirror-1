Version 0.5.1 (2008-11-07)
--------------------------

- Bug: Fix error with non-lating geocode queries. 

- Feature: You can now do::

    <script
    tal:replace="provider:keas.googlemap.browser.interfaces.IJavaScript"
    />

  and magically get all the necessary javascript viewlets to use the
  google map.

- Feature: marker now has a popupOnLoad attribute that can be set to True
  to get marker's info window displayed when page is loaded, not only when
  marker is clicked. Note that only one marker can have popupOnLoad == True.
