<h1>Application Design Considerations</h1>
<p>When writing an application, we
must try and cover the three activities mentioned in our overview of
what a simple resource looks like:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Examine the transaction, decide what the user wants to do.</li>
  <li>Perform some kind of action with the information supplied.</li>
  <li>Produce some kind of response which tells the user what happened.</li>
</ol>
<p>We briefly covered the third activity in the <a href="resources.html"><code>MyApplication</code>
example</a>, but for a real, properly-behaved application, we need to visit
each activity in detail.</p>
<h2>Examine the Transaction</h2>
<p>In WebStack, the transaction is an object which is passed into a
resource when a user makes contact with an application. This
transaction object effectively tells us what it is the user wants to
do; it does so through a number of different pieces of information
including the request method, headers, parameters, cookies and sessions.</p>
<p>The transaction object appears as the first parameter in a
resource's&nbsp;<code>respond</code> method:</p>

<pre>class MyResource:<br />    def respond(self, trans):<br />        [Here is where the code for the resource is written.]</pre>

<p>Within this activity,&nbsp;certain&nbsp;topics&nbsp;are of interest:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="paths.html">URLs and Paths</a></li>
  <li><a href="methods.html">Request Methods</a></li>
  <li><a href="parameters.html">Request Parameters and Uploads</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For full information about transaction objects, see the API
documentation for the&nbsp;<a href="../apidocs/public/WebStack.Generic.Transaction-class.html"><code>WebStack.Generic.Transaction</code></a>
class.</p>

<h2>Perform Actions</h2>
<p>Of all activities summarised above, this is the most vague because
the kinds of actions performed by applications will vary substantially
depending on what the application is supposed to do. Indeed, it is
within this activity that most applications will probably be integrated
with other systems - they may access databases or Web services, for
example.</p>
<p>WebStack does not mandate any particular style of integration with
other systems. It is generally recommended that developers use
whichever Python modules or packages they prefer and just to import
these into their applications. See&nbsp;<a href="integrating.html">"Integrating
with Other Systems"</a> for advice on this subject.</p>
<h2>Produce a Response</h2>
<p>This activity was briefly covered in&nbsp;the <code>MyApplication</code>
example, but for "real world" applications the following topics must be
understood in more detail:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="responses.html">Responses and Presentation</a></li>
  <li><a href="state.html">Cookies, Sessions, Users and Persistent
Information</a></li>
</ul>
</body></html>
