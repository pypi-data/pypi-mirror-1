<h1>Integrating with Other Systems</h1>
<p>Most Web applications are not self-contained - instead of
providing information which is written into the application
code itself, they may often access data from other places or even
communicate with other systems. Since applications may be very
different in the way that they access external systems or the way
in which they obtain external information, WebStack does not mandate
rigid mechanisms for hooking into such systems or loading such
information. Instead, it is recommended that applications import
packages and modules which provide the functionality necessary to carry
out such integration.</p>
<h2>Examples of Packages</h2>
<p>Examples of packages and modules that might be used for integration
purposes include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Database access packages, including object-relational mappers.</li>
  <li>Communications libraries - for connecting to Web services or
other remote services, for example.</li>
  <li>Templating or reporting systems. (Note that templating systems
are also very useful when generating <a href="responses.html">responses</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<h2> Using External Packages</h2>
<p>In the simplest of cases, the use of external packages is as
straightforward as importing a Python module (or package) and then
using that module's contents. This can often be done in the <a
 href="resources.html">resource</a> code; for example:</p>
<pre>import urllib<br /><br />class MyResource:<br />    def respond(self, trans):<br />        [Examine the transaction, decide what the user wants to do.]<br /><br />        f = urllib.urlopen("http://www.boddie.org.uk/rss/feed.xml")<br /><br />        [Produce some kind of response which tells the user what happened.]</pre>
<p>In the above example, here is what happens:</p>
<table style="text-align: left; width: 80%;" align="center" border="1"
 cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>What we do</th>
      <th>Where it happens and how often</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="undefined" valign="undefined"> Import <code>urllib</code>
to gain access to functionality which we can then use to access a
remote service.</td>
      <td align="undefined" valign="undefined">This happens once - when
the above code is itself imported into Python.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="undefined" valign="undefined">Use the <code>urlopen</code>
function of <code>urllib</code> to actually access a remote service.</td>
      <td align="undefined" valign="undefined">This happens in the
resource code each time the resource decides to access the service.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>In this case, the functionality is relatively easy to acquire and
does not require any initialisation. But what if we were connecting to
a database? There might be a need to specially initialise the database
module - only once, though - and then repeatedly use it. Consider this
highly artificial example:</p>
<pre>import mydb<br /><br />connection = mydb.connect("me", "myPassword")<br /><br />class MyResource:<br />    def respond(self, trans):<br />        [Examine the transaction, decide what the user wants to do.]<br /><br />        results = connection.query("feed", owner="boddie.org.uk")<br /><br />        [Produce some kind of response which tells the user what happened.]
</pre>
<p>In the above example, here is what happens:</p>
<table style="text-align: left; width: 80%;" align="center" border="1"
 cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>What we do</th>
      <th>Where it happens and how often</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="undefined" valign="undefined">Import the <code>mydb</code>
module to gain access to database access functionality.</td>
      <td align="undefined" valign="undefined">This happens once - when
the above code is itself imported into Python.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="undefined" valign="undefined">Initialise a database
connection using the <code>connect</code> function from the <code>mydb</code>
module.</td>
      <td align="undefined" valign="undefined">This also happens only
once - when the above code is itself imported into Python.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="undefined" valign="undefined">Use the <code>query</code>
method on the connection object to access a database.</td>
      <td align="undefined" valign="undefined">This happens in the
resource code each time the resource decides to access the database.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>The choice of initialising the connection may seem arbitrary - why
not just obtain a connection in the resource? Usually, such decisions
are made on the basis of efficiency and on constraints outside the
control of the application - some database systems limit the number of
connections, for example, and if a large number of resources suddenly
became active, some of them would fail to obtain connections if the
connection initialisation code were in the <code>respond</code>
method of the resource.</p>
<h2>Configuring Packages Globally</h2>
<p>Of course, the above resource might not be the only resource to use
database connections. It might then be tempting to initialise a
connection for each module whose resource needs (or, since as normal
Python classes we can put many resources in a single module, whose
resources need) to access a database. But it would surely be more
convenient to define a single, central place to hold such global
resources.</p>
<p>One approach is to define a module which can be accessed by all
modules, and thus by all resources. Let us create such a module in the
file <code>Properties.py</code> which will reside alongside <code>MyApplication.py</code>
(or whatever the application module is called). Inside the <code>Properties</code>
module we can write the following code:</p>
<pre>import mydb<br /><br />connection = mydb.connect("me", "myPassword")</pre>
<p>Now, in each module containing resources which need to access the
database, all we need to do now is to import the <code>Properties</code>
module and to use the connection as defined in that module:</p>
<pre>import Properties<br /><br />class MyResource:<br />    def respond(self, trans):<br />        [Examine the transaction, decide what the user wants to do.]<br /><br />        results = Properties.connection.query("feed", owner="boddie.org.uk")<br /><br />        [Produce some kind of response which tells the user what happened.]</pre>
<p>This is a very simple approach that is technically outclassed by the
mechanisms available in some frameworks. Currently, WebStack does not
provide access to those more sophisticated mechanisms, however.</p>
