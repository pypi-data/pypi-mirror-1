<h1>Cookies, Sessions, Users and Persistent Information</h1>
<p>Due to the nature of the communications mechanisms
involved, Web applications do not have automatic or "magic"
knowledge about the people or entities accessing them as application
users. Moreover, Web applications do not necessarily remember anything
about what that user has done before. Due to this behaviour, where
every request must tell the application as much as possible for an
operation to be carried out, Web applications are referred to as being
"stateless".</p>
<p>Yet there are a number of ways of maintaining "state" information -
that is, to remember the following things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Some kind of identify for the user, if only to be able to say
that such a user has visited before (if not to actually give them a
name).</li>
  <li>Some details about their previous interactions with the
application.</li>
</ul>
<p>Such state information is typically provided using a number of
different mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="cookies.html">Cookies</a></li>
  <li><a href="sessions.html">Sessions and Persistent Information</a></li>
  <li><a href="users.html">Users and Authentication</a></li>
</ul>
