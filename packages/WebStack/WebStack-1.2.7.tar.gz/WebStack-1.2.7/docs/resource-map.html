<h1>ResourceMap - Simple Mappings from Names to Resources</h1>
<p>The <code>ResourceMap</code> module provides classes (although
currently only one class is supplied) which act as standard WebStack
resources, but which examine the path or URL from incoming requests and
direct such requests to other resources based on the contents of the
path or URL. In other words, such classes map names or patterns to
WebStack resources and dispatch requests accordingly.</p><h2>Introducing MapResource</h2><p>The <a href="paths-filesystem.html">"Treating the Path Like a Filesystem"</a> document contains an example involving the <code>MapResource</code> class; this class is initialised with a dictionary mapping names to resources as described below.</p><div class="WebStack">
<h3>WebStack API - The MapResource Class</h3>

<p>The <code>MapResource</code>
class (found in the
<code>WebStack.Resources.ResourceMap</code> module) maps names to
resource objects, where to select a resource the
corresponding name must match the first component discovered
in the <a href="path-info.html">virtual "path info"</a>. For example,
consider the following virtual "path info" (where there may have been
more information in the path, but this has already been processed):</p><pre>/documents/news/2005/article.html</pre><p>Here, the name <code>documents</code>
would match the above virtual "path info". Meanwhile, after processing
more of the information, we might have the following remains of the
path:</p><pre>/2005/article.html</pre><p>Here, the name <code>2005</code> would match, leaving the following information unprocessed:</p><pre>/article.html</pre><p>Here, the name <code>article.html</code> would match. However, let us consider the following original virtual "path info" instead:</p><pre>/documents/news/2005/</pre><p>After processing the leading components, we may instead end up with this:</p><pre>/</pre><p>Here, only an empty string as the name will specifically match the above.</p><h4>Further Reading</h4><p>The <a href="../apidocs/public/WebStack.Resources.ResourceMap.MapResource-class.html">API documentation</a> for the <code>MapResource</code>
class provides more detail on the subject of name matching, including
the special "catch all" name and a discussion of the pass-through
parameter.</p></div></body></html>
