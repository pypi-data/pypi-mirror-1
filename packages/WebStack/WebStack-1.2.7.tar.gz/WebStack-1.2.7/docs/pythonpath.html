<h1>Getting PYTHONPATH Right</h1>

<p>When deploying your application, it is essential that it has access to all
the necessary libraries and packages that it uses. If such libraries and
packages were installed using the standard <code>setup.py</code> program,
then you may only need to worry about the application itself being found by
Python.</p>

<h2>Running Adapters Directly</h2>

<p>For those server environments where you can just run the adapter code
(BaseHTTPRequestHandler, Twisted), you can choose to specify the
<code>PYTHONPATH</code> on the command line when you run the code. Here is an
example of this (using <code>bash</code> on GNU/Linux or UNIX
distributions):</p>
<pre>PYTHONPATH=.:examples/Common python examples/BaseHTTPRequestHandler/SimpleApp.py</pre>

<h2>Adapters Run by the Web Server</h2>

<p>For those server environments where the Web server itself runs the adapter
code (CGI, mod_python, WSGI), you may need to either configure the Web server
to alter the <code>PYTHONPATH</code>, if possible, or to add some extra lines
in the adapter code to change Python's <code>sys.path</code> variable. Here
is an example of this:</p>
<pre>sys.path.append("/home/paulb/Software/Python/WebStack/examples/Common")</pre>

<h2>Configuring PYTHONPATH in Java Servlet Containers</h2>

<p>In servlet container deployments, all required libraries and packages are
typically bundled with the application itself. Since this bundling process is
usually very inconvenient, a script has been included in the
<code>tools/JavaServlet</code> directory to make it slightly easier.</p>

<h2>Configuring PYTHONPATH in Webware</h2>

<p>Since Webware's WebKit runs as a separate process, it is possible to
specify <code>PYTHONPATH</code> on the command line when you start that
process. Here is an example of this (using <code>bash</code> on GNU/Linux or
UNIX distributions):</p>
<pre>cd WebKit
PYTHONPATH=/home/paulb/Software/Python/WebStack/examples/Common ./AppServer</pre>

<h2>Configuring PYTHONPATH in Zope</h2>

<p>In Zope's <code>etc/zope.conf</code> file, <code>path</code> directives
can be used to indicate the location of various resources. Here is an example
of this:</p>
<pre>path /home/paulb/Software/Python/WebStack/examples/Common</pre>
