webstack (1.2.6-0ubuntu1) feisty; urgency=low

  * Added a jython-webstack package for Ubuntu Feisty
    (7.04).
  * Improved support for Jython on Ubuntu Feisty (7.04),
    adding python.path and python.cachedir settings which
    respectively avoid issues with missing libraries (due to
    the separation of libraries in the Ubuntu package) and
    with failed imports (due to a read-only class cache
    directory).
  * Improved the webstack_java_build.py script and added a
    deployment descriptor for JSP to accompany the new Java
    Servlet-specific JSPTest example.
  * Added a special Java Servlet-specific get_servlet method
    to support the JSPTest example. It is envisaged that a
    more general method could be made available for all
    frameworks in order to support access to underlying
    request dispatchers and other framework facilities.
  * Added more Jython-related documentation as suggested by
    Kevin Glynn.
  * Added missing request headers for CGI/WSGI environment
    variables.
  * Fixed Webware support to work with Webware 0.9.4.
  * Fixed/improved Zope path value retrieval.
  * Added support for wsgiref, changing the WSGI deploy
    function for CGI-based applications to deploy_as_cgi and
    adding a deploy_with_wsgiref function.

webstack (1.2.4-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Made a SessionDirectoryRepository which uses directories
    for data produced by the shelve module, rather than
    attempting to manipulate files produced by the shelve
    module, since the details of such files may differ
    between environments: a situation noticed by John
    Krukoff in an environment without the bsddb module
    installed.

webstack (1.1-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Added a Repositories package to provide session-like
    support for different kinds of storage.

    methods to the Transaction class.

    result in session stores being closed properly.

    DirectoryRepository.
  * Made the "not found" behaviour of DirectoryResource more
    configurable.
  * Added documentation for MapResource and DirectoryResource.
