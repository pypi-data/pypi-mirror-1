<h1>Creating Web Applications with WebStack</h1>
<p>This introductory guide describes the process of making a Web
application
using the WebStack framework.</p>
<h2>Setting Up</h2>
<p>First of all, let us assume that the WebStack distribution has been
unpacked and now sits in the <code>WebStack-1.2</code> directory.</p>
<p>Before we begin, we must make sure that the WebStack package is
available
to Python. The easiest way to do this is to change into the
<code>WebStack-1.2</code> directory and to run the <code>setup.py</code>
script provided with the version of Python you are going to be using
(possibly as a privileged user like <code>root</code>):</p>
<pre>cd WebStack-1.2<br />python setup.py install</pre>
<p>If you don't want to install WebStack in this way, or if you can't
do so
because you don't have <code>root</code> privileges, you can just make
sure
that the <code>WebStack-1.2</code> directory sits on your
<code>PYTHONPATH</code>.</p>
<h2>Supported Frameworks</h2><p>With the help of Python's built-in
standard library, WebStack can run without any additional software, but
you may wish to investigate the other supported frameworks in order to
run WebStack applications in other environments.</p><ul><li><a href="supported-frameworks.html">Supported Frameworks</a></li></ul><h2>Viewing the API Documentation</h2>
<p>The API documentation for use in conjunction with this
guide can be found inside the&nbsp;<a href="../apidocs/index.html"><code>apidocs</code></a>
directory within the <code>WebStack-1.2</code> directory. Of course,
it is always possible to view WebStack's API documentation
within Python by importing modules (such as&nbsp;<a href="../apidocs/public/WebStack.Generic-module.html"><code>WebStack.Generic</code></a>)
and using Python's built-in&nbsp;<code>help</code> function.</p>
