webstack (1.2.4-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Made a SessionDirectoryRepository which uses directories
    for data produced by the shelve module, rather than
    attempting to manipulate files produced by the shelve
    module, since the details of such files may differ
    between environments: a situation noticed by John
    Krukoff in an environment without the bsddb module
    installed.

webstack (1.1-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Added a Repositories package to provide session-like
    support for different kinds of storage.
  * Added an explicit filesystem encoding to the Calendar
    example and adopted the DirectoryRepository from the
    Repositories package.
  * Added get_path_without_info, update_path and redirect
    methods to the Transaction class.
  * Added get_attributes (attribute support) to the
    Transaction class.
  * Added a values method to Helpers.Session.Wrapper.

    result in session stores being closed properly.

    DirectoryRepository.
  * Made the "not found" behaviour of DirectoryResource more
    configurable.
  * Added documentation for MapResource and DirectoryResource.
