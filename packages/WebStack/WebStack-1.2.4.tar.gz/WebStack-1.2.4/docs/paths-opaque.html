<h1>Using the Path as an Opaque Reference into an Application</h1>
<p>Since many Web applications have complete control over how paths are
interpreted, the form of the path doesn't necessarily have to follow
any
obvious structure as far as users of your application is concerned.
Here's an
example:</p>
<pre>/000251923572ax-0015</pre>
<p>Many people would argue that such obscure references, whilst
perfectly
acceptable to machines, would make any application counter-intuitive
and very
difficult to reference. However,&nbsp;application developers sometimes
do not want people
"bookmarking" resources or functions within an application, and so such
concerns don't matter to them.</p>
