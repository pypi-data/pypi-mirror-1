<h1>Treating the Path Mostly Like a Filesystem</h1>

<p>...but really using it to broadly identify different resources or
services. In this approach, we take a path like this...</p>
<pre>/tools/viewer</pre>

<p>...and interpret it as being a request for a certain function of the
application. Often, this approach is used because it matches some aspect of
how the application is actually organised. Consider this example:</p>
<pre>/cgi-bin/script.pl</pre>

<p>This kind of thing generally appears in URLs because of the way the
application concerned has been deployed - CGI programs live in a particular
place and are accessed using a special path "prefix".</p>
