Specifying the appropriate PYTHONPATH, invoke the application program. For
example, in the WebStack distribution directory:

PYTHONPATH=.:examples/Common python examples/BaseHTTPRequestHandler/SimpleApp.py

The WebStack package must reside on the PYTHONPATH, along with the package
containing the application itself.

Secure Server
-------------

The server can be made secure (ie. to serve https URLs over SSL) by using the
secure_deploy function and by providing key and certificate filenames. See
