<h1>URLs and Paths</h1>
<p>The URL at which your application shall appear is arguably the first
part
of the application's user interface that any user will see. Remember
that a user of your application does not have to be a real person; in
fact,
a user can be any of the following things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A real person entering the URL into a browser's address bar.</li>
  <li>A real person linking to your application by writing the URL in a
separate Web page.</li>
  <li>A program which has the URL defined within it and which may
manipulate the URL to perform certain kinds of operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some application developers have a fairly rigid view of what kind of
information a URL should contain and how it should be structured. In
this guide, we shall look at a number of different approaches.</p>
<h2>Interpreting Path Information</h2>
<p>What the URL is supposed to do is to say where (on the Internet or
on an
intranet) your application resides and which resource or service is
being
accessed, and these look like this:</p>
<pre>http://www.boddie.org.uk/python/WebStack.html</pre>
<p>In an application the full URL, containing the address of the
machine on which it is running, is not always interesting. In the
WebStack API (and in other Web programming frameworks), we also talk
about "paths" - a path is&nbsp;just the part of the
URL which refers to the resource or service, ignoring the actual
Internet
address, and so the above example would have a path which looks like
this:</p>
<pre>/python/WebStack.html</pre>
<p>When writing a Web application, most of the time you just need to
concentrate on the path because the address doesn't usually tell you
anything
you don't already know. What you need to do is to interpret the path
specified in the request in order to work out which resource or service
the user is trying to access.</p>

<h3>WebStack API - Path Methods in Transaction Objects</h3>
<p>WebStack provides the following transaction methods for inspecting
path
information:</p>
<dl>
  <dt><code>get_path</code></dt>
  <dd>This gets the entire path of a resource including parameter
information (as described in <a href="parameters.html">"Request
Parameters and Uploads"</a>).</dd>
  <dt><code>get_path_without_query</code></dt>
  <dd>This gets the entire path of a resource but without any parameter
information.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<h2>Query Strings</h2>
<p>Sometimes, a "query string" will be provided as part of a URL; for
example:</p>
<pre>http://www.boddie.org.uk/application?param1=value1</pre>
<p>The question mark character marks the beginning of the query string
which
contains encoded parameter information; such information and its
inspection
is discussed in <a href="parameters.html">"Request Parameters and
Uploads"</a>.</p>
