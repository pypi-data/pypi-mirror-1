webstack (1.1-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Added a Repositories package to provide session-like
    support for different kinds of storage.
  * Added an explicit filesystem encoding to the Calendar
    example and adopted the DirectoryRepository from the
    Repositories package.
  * Added get_path_without_info, update_path and redirect
    methods to the Transaction class.
  * Added get_attributes (attribute support) to the
    Transaction class.
  * Added a values method to Helpers.Session.Wrapper.
  * Fixed get_processed_virtual_path_info (to match from
    right to left).
  * Improved/fixed exception handling in the adapters so
    that transactions are committed as the final act of an
    adapter experiencing an unhandled exception. This should
    result in session stores being closed properly.
  * Changed the Helpers.Session.SessionStore to use
    DirectoryRepository.
  * Made the "not found" behaviour of DirectoryResource more
    configurable.
  * Added documentation for MapResource and DirectoryResource.
  * Fixed the distribution names in the Ubuntu changelog.
