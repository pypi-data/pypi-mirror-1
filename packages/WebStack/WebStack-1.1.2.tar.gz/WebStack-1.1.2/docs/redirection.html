<h1>Redirection</h1><p>Instead of presenting information to a user when
that user visits a particular URL, we may instead choose to redirect
that user to another URL, at which there may be information to be
viewed. To redirect a user of an application, we can use the following
transaction method:</p><div class="WebStack">
<h3>WebStack API - Redirection</h3>
<p>WebStack provides the following method in transaction objects to perform redirection:</p>
<dl><dt><code>redirect</code></dt><dd>This method accepts a path value
suitable for use in response headers indicating the location to which a
user shall be redirected. An optional response code (see <a href="responses.html">"Responses and Presentation"</a>) can be specified to modify the meaning of the redirection (as defined in the HTTP specifications).</dd></dl></div><p>Since the path value must be usable in response header, it is necessary to transform paths as described in the <a href="path-value-encoding.html">"Encoding and Decoding Path Values"</a> document, and an example of redirection is given in that document.</p></body></html>
