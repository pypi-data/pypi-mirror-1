<h1>Users and Authentication</h1>
<p>One way of discovering the identity of the user sending a request
into your application is&nbsp;to test the identity using methods on the
transaction object. Before this can be made to work, you must&nbsp;set
up authentication for your application, as described in <a
 href="securing.html">"Securing a WebStack Application"</a>. Once
authentication is working, every request that arrives in the
application will have the identity of the user attached automatically.</p>
<h2>Uses of User Identity</h2>
<p>Having access to a user's identity can be useful in making decisions
about which operations that user is able to perform within your
application. Moreover, the user identity provided by authentication
mechanisms can tell you more about who that user is, as opposed to
typical session information which, on its own, can only really confirm
that the user in question has visited the application before.</p>

<h3>WebStack API - User Identity</h3>
<p>Transaction objects have the following methods for inspecting and
redefining the identity of users:</p>
<dl>
  <dt><code>get_user</code></dt>
  <dd>This gets the name of the user attempting to access the
application.</dd>
  <dt><code>set_user</code></dt>
  <dd>This sets the name of the user, thus affecting subsequent calls
to <code>get_user</code>, allowing certain parts of an application to
view users according to other criteria than their basic username - for
example, one might use <code>set_user</code> to redefine each user's
identity in terms of the role that user may have in an application.</dd>
