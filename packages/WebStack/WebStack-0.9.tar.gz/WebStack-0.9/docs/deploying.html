<h1>Deploying a WebStack Application</h1>
<p>The process of deploying a WebStack application should be as
straightforward as taking some adapter or "glue" code and either
running it
or using the deployment processes of the server environment or
framework in
which the application will be living.</p>
<h2>The Adapter Code</h2>
<p>What adapter or "glue" code does is to set up your applications main
resource object and to hook that object up with the underlying server
environment. For the&nbsp;<code>MyApplication</code> <a
 href="resources.html">example</a>, together with a simple environment,
looks something like
this:</p>
<pre>from WebStack.Adapters.BaseHTTPRequestHandler import deploy    # import the support for the server environment<br />from MyApplication import MyResource                           # import the main resource class<br />print "Serving..."<br />deploy(MyResource())                                           # connect a resource object to the server environment</pre>
<p>In the case of BaseHTTPRequestHandler, which is a module in the
Python standard library, you can just run this code, making sure that
the <code>MyApplication</code> module or package is on your <code>PYTHONPATH</code>.
Then, you can visit&nbsp;<code>http://localhost:8080</code> in your
browser and see the result.</p>
<h3>More Demanding Adapter Code</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, not all server environments can be connected up with
applications this easily. Some environments require special classes and
functions to be defined in the adapter code in order for
applications to
be properly integrated into those environments. A summary of the
requirements of each environment can be found in <a
 href="writing-adapters.html">"Writing Adapters"</a>.</p>
