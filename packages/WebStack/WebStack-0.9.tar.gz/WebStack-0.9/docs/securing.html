<h1>Securing a WebStack Application</h1>
<p>Making sure that Web applications are "secure" involves many
different
aspects of application design, deployment and administration. This
guide currently only covers the usage of the authentication features of
the WebStack API.</p>
<h2>Authentication in WebStack</h2>
<p>There are two principal methods of introducing authentication and
applying
access control to WebStack applications:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="authenticators.html">Application-Wide Authenticators</a></li>
  <li><a href="login-redirect.html">LoginRedirect and Login Modules</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a comparison of the features of these mechanisms:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <th>Application-Wide Authenticators</th>
      <th>LoginRedirect and Login Modules</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Deployment</th>
      <td>
      <ul>
        <li>Some Web server configuration required.</li>
        <li>The application only requires an additional object to be
instantiated to support authentication.</li>
      </ul>
      </td>
      <td>
      <ul>
        <li>An additional login application or resource must be
deployed.</li>
      </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Flexibility</th>
      <td>
      <ul>
        <li>The user experience may seem too inflexible or unfriendly -
users may only get the login dialogue.</li>
        <li>There is also probably no logout function, since it
requires browser support.</li>
        <li> HTTP-style authentication is well understood and supported
when automating client access.</li>
      </ul>
      </td>
      <td>
      <ul>
        <li>The login and logout activities can be customised to suit
the appearance of the rest of the application.</li>
        <li> Many applications can share the same login application,
providing a "single sign-on" experience and potentially reduced
administrative overhead.</li>
      </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
