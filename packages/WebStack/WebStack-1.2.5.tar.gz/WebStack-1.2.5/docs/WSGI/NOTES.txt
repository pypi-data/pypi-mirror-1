Currently, the WSGI examples use the WSGI CGI handler code found in PEP 333
and placed in the wsgi_cgi module. Deploying in other environments would
require slightly different "glue code" to be written.

--------

Declare the script in httpd.conf or equivalent Web server configuration file.
For example:

ScriptAlias /wsgi/simple "/home/paulb/Software/Python/WebStack/examples/WSGI/SimpleHandler.py"

The WebStack package must reside on the PYTHONPATH, along with the package
containing the application itself. Therefore, ensure that the handler uses the
appropriate entries in sys.path.

Ensure that the handler file for the application has the appropriate
permissions:

chmod u+x examples/WSGI/SimpleHandler.py
