        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Added a set of import tools for relative and absolute imports at runtime
        even within scripts and with versions of Python prior to 2.5.
        * Added missing ``posixpath`` import.
        * Changed ``AttributeDict`` to raise an ``AttributeError`` when setting a
        non-existent key instead of a ``NotImplementedError``.
        
        2009-06-13
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Added ``uniform_path()`` function
        * Added begining of code for import related functions, including relative
        imports within scripts (Python 2.5 only supports relative imports within
        packages)
        * Added ``relpath()``, a function to calculate the relative path between two
        locations (only works on POSIX systems and already exists in Python 2.6)
