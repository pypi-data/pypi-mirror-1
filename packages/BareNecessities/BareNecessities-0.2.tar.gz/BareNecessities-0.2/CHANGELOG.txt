  non-existent key instead of a ``NotImplementedError``.

* Added ``uniform_path()`` function
* Added begining of code for import related functions, including relative 
  imports within scripts (Python 2.5 only supports relative imports within
  packages)
* Added ``relpath()``, a function to calculate the relative path between two
  locations (only works on POSIX systems and already exists in Python 2.6)
