        Overview
        ========
        
        The *p4a.calendar* package is a package for producing calendars from
        collection of events. Features include:
        
        Monthly view
        Any calendar activated (smart) folder can has several default views
        including a monthly view.
        
        Chronological event view
        The events gathered together by the activated calendar can be displayed
        using a chronological event listing.
        
        Past events view
        Events that have already occurred are grouped into a past events listing page.
        
        Color coding by event type
        Events can be color coded based on what event type (keyword) they have
        been assigned.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        1. When you're reading this you have probably already run
        ``easy_install p4a.calendar``. Find out how to install setuptools
        (and EasyInstall) here:
        http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall
        
        2. For installation into a Zope environment, create a file called
        ``p4a.calendar-configure.zcml`` in the
        ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
        should only contain this::
        
        <include package="p4a.calendar" />
