Description: sudokulib is a collection of tools that are useful for
        generating solutions to Sudoku puzzles.  It uses a recursive backtracking
        algorithm (originally written by Jeremy Brown, Cel Destept), and is
        capable of generating a 3x3 Sudoku in ~0.015 seconds.  It can also generate
        4x4 Sudokus in ~0.100 seconds (sometimes longer).
        
        Some 5x5 grids have been generated in a matter of seconds using this library,
        but I've also seen the program run for hours without successfully generating
        a 5x5.  Anything beyond 5x5 always seems to take a long time.
        
        The library also provides utilities for generating starting grids, so you can
        play Sudoku instead of just generating solutions.  There are several difficulty
        levels to choose from.
