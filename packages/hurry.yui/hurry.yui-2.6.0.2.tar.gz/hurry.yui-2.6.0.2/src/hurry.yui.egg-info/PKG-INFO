        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages YUI_ for `hurry.resource`_. It is aware of YUI's
        dependency structure and different modes (normal, minified and debug)
        and resource rollups.
        
        .. _`hurry.resource`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hurry.resource
        
        .. _YUI: http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        You can import various bits of YUI from ``hurry.yui`` and ``.need``
        them where you want these resources to be included on a page::
        
        from hurry import yui
        
        .. in your page or widget rendering code, somewhere ..
        
        yui.datatable.need()
        
        All the module names as listed here_ are available in the
        ``hurry.yui`` package. In addition rolled up modules are also
        available (such as ``reset_fonts_grids``), but rollup inclusion will
        be done automatically so these need not to be referred to
        explicitly. See the `hurry.resource`_ documentation for more
        information.
        
        .. _here: http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yuiloader/#modulenames
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and
        ``hurry.resource``, and making sure that the original resources
        (shipped in the ``yui-build`` directory in ``hurry.yui``) are
        published to some URL.
        
        The package has already been integrated for Grok_ and Zope 3. If you
        depend on the `hurry.zopeyui`_ package in your ``setup.py``, the above
        example should work out of the box.
        
        .. _`hurry.zopeyui`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hurry.zopeyui
        
        .. _Grok: http://grok.zope.org
        
        Preparing hurry.yui before release
        ==================================
        
        This section is only relevant to release managers of ``hurry.yui``; if
        you don't know whether you are, you aren't.
        
        When releasing ``hurry.yui``, an extra step should be taken. Follow
        the regular package `release instructions`_, but before egg generation
        (``python setup.py register sdist upload``) first execute
        ``bin/yuiprepare <version number>``, where version number is the
        version of the YUI release, such as ``2.6.0``. This will do two
        things:
        
        * download the YUI of that version and place it in the egg
        
        * download the YUI dependency structure of that YUI version and generate
        a ``yui.py`` file in the package that reflects this.
