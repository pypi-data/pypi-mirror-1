Description: An object-oriented API to test doctests using unittest runners.
        
        Module providing classes which extend doctest module so
        as to achieve better integration with unittest.
        
        It is different from the Pyhton 2.4 doctest unittest API because:
        
        * A new unitest.TestLoader descendant now allows to load instances
        of TestCases for doctests using unittest-style, supports building
        complex test suites in a more natural way, and eases the use of
        specialized instances of TestCase built out of doctest examples.
        
        * Other loaders allow users to extract TestCase instances out of
        TestCase descendants and doctests (and any other format) in a
        single step.
        
        * In this case unittest.TestResult instances report whether
        individual examples have been successfully executed, or otherwise
        have failed or raised an unexpected exception. Formerly TestResult
        objects contained the whole report outputted by doctest module.
        
        * Test analysis require no further parsing to retrieve detailed
        information about failures.
        
        * A whole new unittest API for doctest adds object orientation and
        eliminates functions with big signatures.
        
        * It is not necessary to use DocTestRunner output streams in order
        to collect test results.
        
        * A new hierarchy of doctest TestCases is now
        possible so for example, setUp and tearDown may
        be redefined across a hierarchy of TestCases
        instead of providing this methods as parameters to
        a function (breaking OOP philosophy and logic); or
        maybe even failures and errors can be represented in a
        custom way.
        
        * Allows to perform regression testing over tests written
        using doctest.
        
        * Fixes a minor bug related with specifying different verbosity
        levels from the command line to unittest.TestProgram (alias main).
        
        * Loads by default test cases for doctests plus those
        formerly loaded by unittest.TestLoader
        
        It is similar to the Pyhton 2.4 doctest unittest API because:
        
        * Provides integration with TestProgram and unittest test runners.
        
        * Allows to parameterize doctest behavior via doctest options

        Note: The contents of this module were first implemented by the module
        oop.utils.testing in the PyOOP package.
