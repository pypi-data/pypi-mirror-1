Description: Object-oriented API for doctest/unittest integration.
        
        Module providing classes which extend doctest module so
        as to achieve better integration with unittest.
        
        doctest extensions:
        -->    A whole new unittest API to integrate doctest tests.
        -->    It allows to acquire the individual results of each
        and every DocTest instances' example.
        -->    You do not need to use DocTestRunner output streams
        to collect test results.
        -->    Gathering individual examples' results.
        -->    Failures and errors are collected individually into
        TestResults, making easier the automation of
        post-testing analysis.
        -->    A new hierarchy of doctest TestCases is now
        possible so for example, setUp and tearDown may
        be redefined across a hierarchy of TestCases
        instead of providing this methods as parameters to
        a function (breaking OOP philosophy and logic); or
        maybe even to represent failures and errors in a
        custom way.
        -->    A new doctest TestLoader now allows to load doctest
        TestCases using unittest-style, provides integration
        with TestProgram, supports building complex TestSuites
        in a more natural way, and eases the use of specialized
        instances of TestCases built out of doctest examples.
        -->    Allows to perform regression testing over tests written
        using doctest.
