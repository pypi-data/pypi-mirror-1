        ============
        Introduction
        ============
        
        ClueReleaseManager is an implementation of the PyPi server backend as provided
        by http://pypi.python.org.  It uses SQLAlchemy (on top of sqlite by default)
        to store all project metadata and the filesystem for storing project files.
        
        Current Features
        ================
        
        * User registration via setuptools
        * File upload (ie eggs) via setuptools
        * Basic authentication based security
        * Simple index browsing
        
        Upcoming Features
        =================
        
        * Full http://pypi.python.org PyPi server compatibility
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        * Python 2.5
        * setuptools
        * SQLAlchemy 0.5rc4 or higher
        * repoze.who 1.0.8 or higher
        * Werkzeug 0.4 or higher (less than 0.5 which has issues)
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Install using the ``easy_install`` tool such as::
        
        $ easy_install ClueReleaseManager
        
        This will provide the ``cluerelmgr-server`` and ``cluerelmgr-admin`` scripts
        which are the entry points for everything ClueReleaseManager.
        
        Getting Started
        ===============
        
        First User
        ----------
        
        By default there are no security/access rules setup so uploading to
        the ClueReleaseManager instance will not work.  The most important
        step to getting ready is to create a new user with access::
        
        $ cluerelmgr-admin updateuser firstuser somepassword firstuser@localhost manager
        
        This command creates a new user with the username "firstuser",
        password "somepassword", and email "firstuser@localhost".  The "manager"
        entry at the end gives this user complete access to this
        ClueReleaseManager instance.
        
        Launching Server
        ----------------
        
        Now that we have the user created, we can go ahead and launch the server::
        
        $ cluerelmgr-server
        
        First Upload -- standard distutils/setuptools
        ---------------------------------------------
        
        First you need to configure your local distutils to use the new local pypi
        server.  To do this, edit ``$HOME/.pypirc``::
        
        [server-login]
        username:firstuser
        password:somepassword
        
        Next go into your new project and register it with the server::
        
        $ python setup.py register -r http://localhost:8080
        
        And now that the project (or distro in ClueReleaseManager terms) is
        registered, we can upload files::
        
        $ python setup.py bdist_egg sdist upload -r http://localhost:8080
        
        Allowing Anonymous Access
        -------------------------
        
        There is a special user named *anonymous* that can also be given roles.  To
        allow an anonymous user to view all distros, first add him to
        a group::
        
        $ cluerelmgr-admin updateusersgroups anonymous common
        
        And next give that group access global access by doing::
        
        $ cluerelmgr-admin updategroup common reader
        
        
        Server Command-Line Options
        ---------------------------
        
        ::
        
        Usage: cluerelmgr-server [options]
        
        Options:
        -h, --help            show this help message and exit
        -p PORT, --port=PORT  Port to listen on, defaults to 8080
        -i HOST, --interface=HOST
        Host to listen on, defaults to 0.0.0.0
        -b BASEFILEDIR, --basefiledir=BASEFILEDIR
        Base directory to store uploaded files,
        defaults to files
        -d, --debug           Activate debug mode
        -s, --self-register   Allow self-registration
        -u BASEURL, --baseurl=BASEURL
        The base url used in case of proxying
        --security-config=SECURITY_CONFIG
        Use a separate configuration file to declare
        the repoze.who config. See
        http://static.repoze.org/whodocs
        /#middleware-configuration-via-config-file
        for details.
        --backup-pypi=BACKUP_PYPIS
        Python indexes to fall back to.  When backup
        index servers are configured they will be
        queried if the user browsing this server has
        the adddistro role and the this server will
        be updated with all metadata and files.
