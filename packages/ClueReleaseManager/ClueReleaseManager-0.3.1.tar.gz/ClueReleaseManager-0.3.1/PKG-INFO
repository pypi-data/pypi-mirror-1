        ============
        Introduction
        ============
        
        ClueReleaseManager is an implementation of the PyPi server backend as provided
        by http://pypi.python.org.  It uses SQLAlchemy (on top of sqlite by default)
        to store all project metadata and the filesystem for storing project files.
        
        Current Features
        ================
        
        * User registration via setuptools
        * File upload (ie eggs) via setuptools
        * Basic authentication based security
        * Simple index browsing
        
        Upcoming Features
        =================
        
        * Full http://pypi.python.org PyPi server compatibility
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        * Python 2.5
        * setuptools
        * SQLAlchemy 0.5rc4 or higher
        * repoze.who 1.0.8 or higher
        * Werkzeug 0.4 or higher
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Install using the ``easy_install`` tool such as::
        
        $ easy_install ClueReleaseManager
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Once ClueReleaseManager is installed, the script cluerelmgr-server will
        be created to launch the server.  See ``cluerelmgr-server --help`` for
        further usage details.
        
        By default ClueReleaseManager will create a ``cluerelmgr.db`` sqlite3 db
        file in the current directory (where the server is running from).  It
        will also create a ``files`` directory in the same place which is used
        to store all uploaded files.
        
        Use the ``cluerelmgr-admin`` script to setup initial configuration.  The
        following example configures a new user, adds them to a managers group,
        and gives the manager group all access to all distros::
        
        $ cluerelmgr-admin updateuser user1 somepass someemail
        $ cluerelmgr-admin updategroup managers adddistro reader
        $ cluerelmgr-admin updateusersgroups user1 managers
        
        Want to give anonymous users access to everything?  (The anonymous user
        is a special user that cannot have a password named ``anonymous``) You
        can now just add them to the newly created ``managers`` group::
        
        $ cluerelmgr-admin updateusersgroups anonymous managers
        
        User registration can occur through the standard
        ``python setup.py register <someproject>`` command (which gives you an option
        for registration) or by manually inserting a user record into the
        ``cluerelmgr.db`` file.
        
        Server Command-Line Options
        ---------------------------
        
        ::
        
        Usage: cluerelmgr-server [options]
        
        Options:
        -h, --help            show this help message and exit
        -p PORT, --port=PORT  Port to listen on, defaults to 8080
        -i HOST, --interface=HOST
        Host to listen on, defaults to 0.0.0.0
        -b BASEFILEDIR, --basefiledir=BASEFILEDIR
        Base directory to store uploaded files,
        defaults to files
        -d, --debug           Activate debug mode
        -s, --self-register   Allow self-registration
        -u BASEURL, --baseurl=BASEURL
        The base url used in case of proxying
        --security-config=SECURITY_CONFIG
        Use a separate configuration file to declare
        the repoze.who config. See
        http://static.repoze.org/whodocs
        /#middleware-configuration-via-config-file
        for details.
        --backup-pypi=BACKUP_PYPIS
        Python indexes to fall back to.  When backup
        index servers are configured they will be
        queried if the user browsing this server has
        the adddistro role and the this server will
        be updated with all metadata and files.
