'''upgrades.py - defines the behaviour of upgrades. Used by both the
client and the server.

At the moment the only advantage to having server and client using the
same upgrade class is that you only have to edit in one place to edit
an upgrade, but the goal in future is to have the client and server
performing essentially the same set of calculations as one another.'''
