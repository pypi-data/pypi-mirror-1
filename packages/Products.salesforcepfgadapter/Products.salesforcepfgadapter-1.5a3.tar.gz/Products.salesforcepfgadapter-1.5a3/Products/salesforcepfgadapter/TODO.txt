1.5+ - Future ideas

- An error should be thrown if Salesforce PFG Adapter product is installed and no Salesforce Base Connector
  object has been added to the site.
- fix i18n support for DataGridField column names, and implement the translation
- Take our type out of the types menu in Plone 3.0 (Awaiting fix to: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7370)
- Handle here or at other levels in the stack: 
   SoapFaultError: 'UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION' 'UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION: 
   Server unavailable due to scheduled maintenance'
- switch setDependencyMap and setFieldMap to an event driven system
- display the label as value (key will remain field id), rather than the id of the Salesforce field in the mapping UI.  This is what the Salesforce user is confronted with when they're using the system and may not know what things are called at an API level.
