Change log
==========

0.4dev
------

0.4.1
-----

- Fixed version issue.

0.4.0
-----

- Added patch to support old-style mixin classes in the inheritance
  tree of a mapper class.

- All attributes that are not declared as interface names are now
  persisted automatically using the Pickle-protocol. The exception to
  this rule is attributes starting with the characters "_v_" (volatile
  attributes).

- Changed target to SQLAlchemy 0.5-series.

0.3.2
-----

- Use pickles to store polymorphic attributes; there's no benefit in
  using native columns for amorphic data.

- Dobbin now uses ``zope.sqlalchemy`` for transaction and session
  glue.

0.3.1
-----

- Use native UUID column type (available on PostgreSQL); compatibility
  with SQLite is preserved due to its weak typing.


- Basic type factories are now registered as components.

0.3.0
-----

- Implemented rest of list methods.
  
- Refactoring of table bootstrapping; internal tables now using a
  naming convention less likely to clash with existing tables.

- Added support for ``schema.Dict`` (including polymorphic dictionary
  relation).

- Implemented polymorphic relations for a subset of the basic types
  (int, str, unicode, tuple and list).
  
0.2.9
-----

- Tables are now only created once per minimal interface; this fixes
  issue on both SQLite and Postgres when we create mappers with an
  explicit polymorphic class.

- First entry in change-log.
