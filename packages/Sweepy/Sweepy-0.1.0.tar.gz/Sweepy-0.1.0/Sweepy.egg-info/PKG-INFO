Description: ++++++
        Sweepy
        ++++++
        
        This is a very simple (and ugly) implementation of the well known
        mine sweeper type game, in the Pylons framework. No extra dependencies
        are needed above Pylons itself, except for easy_install.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Assuming you have easy_install::
        
        easy_install Sweepy
        paster make-config Sweepy config.ini
        
        Running Sweepy
        ==============
        
        Assuming you have permissions to run a webserver on port 80 of your
        local machine::
        
        paster serve config.ini
        
        The game is now available at http://localhost .
        
        If not, you need to edit config.ini and change the port under the
        [server:main] section to a port you have permissions to use. This will
        usually be a port above 1024, e.g. 8000; and in that case the game
        is available at http://localhost:8000
