        Introduction
        ------------
        
        SecureMaildropHost marries SecureMailHost_ and MaildropHost_, making this a
        drop-in replacement for SecureMailHost.
        
        SecureMaildropHost uses both SecureMailHost and MaildropHost to do it's work,
        so both must be installed.

        - The 'as_string' change causes registration emails to fail, since those
        messages are not created as MIMEText. This change checks for as_string,
        uses it if available, and otherwise falls back to str.

        - Use the as_string() method of an MIME part to get the string version of
        it. Caught by Sean Fulmer.
