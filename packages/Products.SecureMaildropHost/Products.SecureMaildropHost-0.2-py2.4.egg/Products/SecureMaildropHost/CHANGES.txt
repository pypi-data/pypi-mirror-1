0.2 (released 2008/05/22)
-------------------------

 - The 'as_string' change causes registration emails to fail, since those
   messages are not created as MIMEText. This change checks for as_string,
   uses it if available, and otherwise falls back to str.

 - Use the as_string() method of an MIME part to get the string version of
   it. Caught by Sean Fulmer.
