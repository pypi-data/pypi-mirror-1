- exception handling?

    Curently only strings (like "Operation not permitted") are returned,
    which is a bit awkward. But I'm not sure if I need something
    different.

- the whole wireless extensions of course
- the ability to change settings like: iwconfig eth1 essid "foobar"
- better error control if something goes wrong
- maybe some tests
