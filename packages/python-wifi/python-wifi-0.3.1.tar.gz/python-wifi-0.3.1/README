python-wifi - README
====================

I startet to write a python library which reads wireless data from the
kernel like the wireless extensions. In order to know how to handle all
this binary encrypted C structure stuff, Guido Goldstein from Infrae
helped me to getting started. Thanks to him!

I want to see some output!
--------------------------
I've implemented some example programs which use the functionality of
the libraries. You'll find them in the 'examples' directory. 


Files:
------

    - pyiwconfig, pyiwlist: the corresponding python programs to the C
      correspondents. These are example implementations.
    - iwlibs.py: handles all the black magic ;)


Python Wifi users:
----------------------
If you want to use the wirless library, the methods in the Wireless
class are the ones you want. Lets assume a little example program, which
prints the ESSID:

>>> from pythonwifi.iwlibs import Wireless
>>> wifi = Wireless('eth1')
>>> wifi.getEssid()
'romanofski'
>>> wifi.getMode()
'Managed'


What is implemented?
--------------------

    - pyiwconfig: 
        
            read                                write
            --------------------------------||--------
            Accesspoint MAC                     Mode
            Bitrate
            available Bitrates
            available Channels/Frequency
            ESSID
            Encryption
            Frequency
            Mode
            WirelessName
            Powermanagement
            Retrylimit
            RTS
            Sensitivity
            TXPower
            Statistics
            
    - pyiwlist: prints detailed information about:

            o Bitrates
            o Channels/Frequency
            o Scanning support!
