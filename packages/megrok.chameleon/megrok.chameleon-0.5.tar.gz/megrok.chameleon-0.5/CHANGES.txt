CHANGES
*******

0.5 (2010-03-03)
================

* Added tests to show usage of macros with ``megrok.chameleon``.

* Removed dependency from ``z3c.pt`` by copying the relevant bits over
  and registering them locally.

  Drop support for ``exists('varname')`` expressions. The regular
  TALES expression ``exists: varname/path`` can still be used.

* Switch to use ``Chameleon`` instead of ``chameleon.*`` packages.

0.4 (2010-02-23)
================

* Declared ``megrok`` as namespace package.

* Fixed order of includes in ftesting.zcml.

* Moved pure test-requirements into own setup-section in order to reduce
  dependencies in regular (non-testing) mode.

0.3 (2010-02-14)
================

* Added license file.

0.2 (2009-09-18)
================

* Provide macro access from templates.

* Don't depend anymore on grok, but only grokcore.view.

* Added support for `path()` and `exists()` in page templates. This
  was introduced from `z3c.pt`.

* Fix ZCML includes.

0.1 (2009-02-22)
