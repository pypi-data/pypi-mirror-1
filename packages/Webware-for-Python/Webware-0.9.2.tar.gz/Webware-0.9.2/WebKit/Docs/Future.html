<h1><a id="warning" name="warning">Warning</a></h1>
<p>This document is mostly outdated and out of touch with development.
You can find better information about known bugs and future work
in the <a class="reference" href="http://wiki.w4py.org">Wiki</a> and in the <a class="reference" href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=4866">SourceForge tracker systems</a>,
both accessible from the <a class="reference" href="http://www.webwareforpython.org">Webware Home Page</a>.
The SourceForge task manager is currently not used since these systems should
be sufficient and we do not want to scatter issues in too many systems.</p>

<p>Sprinkled throughout the code are comments tagged with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&#64;&#64;</span></tt> which are
hopefully accompanied by a date and someone's initials. These comments
represent things to be done. The double at-sign (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&#64;&#64;</span></tt>) convention was
chosen because it doesn't appear to be used for anything else.</p>
<p>In addition to the inline comments, some significant items have been
recorded below. These are future ideas, with no commitments or timelines
as to when/if they'll be realized. The Python WebKit is open source,
so feel free to jump in!</p>

<h3><a id="major-items" name="major-items">Major Items</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>CheckSource.py: A program to check the source code conventions.</li>
<li>Role-based security and user-authentication. Goal is to eliminate,
as much as possible, developer-written security logic.
This should be provided by the WebKit and be configurable.</li>
<li>Write a custom adaptor for Apache, Netscape, MS, etc.</li>
<li>Distribution and load balancing.</li>
<li>Fault tolerance.</li>
<li>More sophisticated admin tools including password protection,
clearing logs, displaying a maximum of information at a time, etc.
Consider using module 'resource'.</li>
<li>Investigate case insensitive URLs, especially for the Windows platform.</li>
<li>Plug-ins:
* In ExamplePage, automatically support examples of any plug-in
* Better docs
* Properties.config. 'Load', 0, 1 or the name of the required op sys</li>

<li>Hunt down: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&#64;&#64;</span></tt> tags (which signify &quot;To Be Done&quot;s), <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">FUTURE</span></tt> items

<li>Code clean up.</li>
<li>Right now, if the Application itself (as opposed to Servlets) throws
an exception, it doesn't get captured nicely. However, it is displayed
in the app server's console.</li>
<li>The exception handler is pretty nice and has features like logging,
e-mail, gathering debugging info, etc.
However, on occasions it can throw exceptions too.
There should be a simpler, secondary exception handler for when this happens.</li>
<li>Review the timestamp caching logic and its relation to .pyc files if any.</li>
<li>Add &quot;Last-modified:&quot; to generic files that are served via WebKit.</li>
<li>If a Python file has only one class that inherits from Servlet,
then use that as the Servlet class
(rather than requiring the name be the same as the file).</li>

<h3><a id="testing" name="testing">Testing</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Provide testing web page where people can report their testing results
including version numbers, etc.</li>
<li>Provide higher level automation of testing. For example, a testing script
should be able to launch various app servers multiple times.</li>
<li>Provide highly automated benchmarking so we can track changes in performance.</li>
<li>Expand the regression test suite.</li>

<li>Add a Getting Started Guide and a Screencast.</li>

<li>User's Guide: Create a caching section to discuss the virtues of doing so
(the Color example became 12 X faster on the server side).</li>

<ul class="simple">
<li>Consider including FormKit, FunFormKit or FormEncode:
A plug-in to aid the construction and validation of forms.</li>
<li>Consider adding a simple helper lib for generating HTML
(such as SimpleHTMLGen) to the WebUtils package.</li>
<li>Support <a class="reference" href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/">WSGI</a>.</li>
<li>Consider this statement from the FastCGI docs:
&quot;Redirects are handled similar to CGI. Location headers with values
that begin with &quot;/&quot; are treated as internal-redirects; otherwise,
they are treated as external redirects (302).&quot;</li>
<li>FastCGI app server:
The idea is that if the app server itself supports FastCGI,
then it can be used directly with FastCGI enabled web servers
sans the infamous &quot;adapter&quot;.
Dan Green has brought this up in Webware-discuss.</li>
<li>Consider if we need to support <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;form</span> <span class="pre">action=&quot;x.py?a=1&quot;</span> <span class="pre">method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;</span></tt>
where you will have both a query string and posted data.</li>
<li>Application modifies sys.path so that servlets can say
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">from</span> <span class="pre">SuperServlet</span> <span class="pre">import</span> <span class="pre">SuperServlet</span></tt> where SuperServlet is located in
the same directory as the Servlet. We'd prefer a more sophisticated technique
which does not modify sys.path and does not affect other servlets. (Or maybe
this would go away with a new one-process-per-application architecture.)</li>

<ul class="simple">
<li>Multi-language support/localization (e.g., vend data to clients
in their preferred written language)</li>
<li>Consider CORBA standard RMI-IIOP and it's potential interaction with WebKit.
This technology has been marked for inclusion in J2EE. I imagine the idea
might be that an app server could be used by more than just web browsers.
e.g., it could be used programmatically
(in a more natural way than simulating a web client).</li>
