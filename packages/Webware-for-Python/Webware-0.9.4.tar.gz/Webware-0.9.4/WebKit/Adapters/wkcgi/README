This is a C coded CGI script for talking to the WebKit AppServer.
Just put it in a directory where your webserver can execute CGI scripts,
and you're good to go.

By default, it will try to talk to the AppServer on localhost port 8086.
It'll retry the connection 10 times with a delay of 1 second between retries.

To change any of these parameters, put a file name webkit.cfg in the same
directory as the CGI executable.  A sample file is included here.

Build Instructions:

On Unix:
Just run make. For Solaris and some other Unix variants, you may have to
adapt the LIBS setting in the Makefile before.

On Windows:
If you have the free Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition and the
Microsoft Platform SDK installed, use the 'make.bat' batch file.
You will be able to get prebuilt binaries from webware.sourceforge.net.
If you don't see any there, ask on the webware-discuss mailing list.

Enjoy!
