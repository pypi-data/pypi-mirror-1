
Grammar sub-package
============================================================================

Dragonfly's core is a language object model containing the following
objects:

 - *Grammars* -- these represent collections of *rules*.
 - *Rules* -- these implement complete or partial voice commands, and
   contain a hierarchy of *elements*.
 - *Elements* -- these form the language building blocks of voice commands,
   and represent literal words, element sequences, references to other
   rules, etc.


To illustrate this language model, we discuss an example grammar which
contains 2 voice commands: **"command one"** and **"(second command |
command two) [test]"**.

 - *Grammar*: container for the two voice commands
    - *Rule*: first voice command rule **"command one"**
       - *Literal element*: element for the literal words **"command one"**.
         This element is the root-element of the first command rule
    - *Rule*: second voice command rule **"(second command | command two) [test]"**
       - *Sequence element*: root-element of the second command rule
          - *Alternative element*: first child element of the sequence
             - *Literal element*: element for the literal words **"second command"**
             - *Literal element*: element for the literal words **"command two"**
          - *Optional element*: second child element of the sequence
             - *Literal element*: element for the literal words **"test"**

All of these different objects are described in the documents listed 
below.
