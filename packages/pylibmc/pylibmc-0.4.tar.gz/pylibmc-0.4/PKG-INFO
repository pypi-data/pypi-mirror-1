Description: `pylibmc` is a Python wrapper around the accompanying C Python extension
        `_pylibmc`, which is a wrapper around `libmemcached` from TangentOrg.
        
        You have to install `libmemcached` separately, and have your compiler and
        linker find the include files and libraries.
        
        With `libmemcached` installed and this package set up, the following basic
        usage example should work::
        
        >>> import pylibmc
        >>> mc = pylibmc.Client(["127.0.0.1:11211"])
        >>> mc.set("foo", "Hello world!")
        True
        >>> mc.get("foo")
        'Hello world!'
        
        The API is pretty much `python-memcached`. Some parts of `libmemcached` aren't
        exposed yet. I think.
        
        Behaviors
        =========
        
        `libmemcached` has ways of telling it how to behave. You'll have to refer to
        its documentation on what the different behaviors do.
        
        To change behaviors, quite simply:
        
        >>> mc.behaviors["hash"] = "fnv1a_32"
        
        New in version 0.4
        ==================
        
        Renamed the C module to `_pylibmc`, and added lots of `libmemcached` constants
        to it, as well as implemented behaviors.
