Description: `pylibmc` is a Python wrapper around the accompanying C Python extension
        `handmc`, which is a wrapper around `libmemcached` from TangentOrg.
        
        You have to install `libmemcached` separately, and have your compiler and
        linker find the include files and libraries.
        
        With `libmemcached` installed and this package set up, the following basic
        usage example should work::
        
        >>> import pylibmc
        >>> mc = pylibmc.Client(["127.0.0.1:11211"])
        >>> mc.set("foo", "Hello world!")
        True
        >>> mc.get("foo")
        'Hello world!'
        
        The API is pretty much `python-memcached`. Some parts of `libmemcached` aren't
        exposed yet, one example is behaviors.
