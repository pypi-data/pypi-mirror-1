Description: 
        Curator is a powerful script that allows one to generate Web page image
        galleries with the intent of displaying photographic images on the Web, or for a
        CD-ROM presentation and archiving.
        
        It generates static Web pages only - no special configuration or running scripts
        are required on the server. The script supports many file formats, hierarchical
        directories, thumbnail generation and update, per-image description file with
        any attributes, and 'tracks' of images spanning multiple directories. The
        templates consist of HTML with embedded Python. Running this script only
        requires a recent Python interpreter and the Python Imaging Library OR the
        ImageMagick tools. If you've been looking for a simple yet very powerful script
        to do this task you've come to the right place.
