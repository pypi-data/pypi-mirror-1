Description: Where am py?
        ============
        
        About
        -----
        
        ``whereampy`` is a terrible play on words (as in "Where am I?") created
        as an example utility to show off a simple ``setuptools``/``setup.py``
        distribution package.
        
        ``mkpkg`` is a small utlity that demonstrates how to use pkg_resources to
        load data files out of a package (instead of relying on __file__ or similar
        mechanisms).
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        whereampy
        ~~~~~~~~~
        
        Simply run ``whereampy`` from the command line and use the ``--help`` option
        for more information.
        
        mkpkg
        ~~~~~
        
        Assuming you have a ``src`` subdirectory in your home directory::
        
        localhost:~$ mkpkg -s spam/spam
        
        will create a directory spam containing a skeleton ``setup.py`` file as well
        as a subdirectory ``spam`` with an ``__init__.py`` file.
        
        See ``mkpkg --help`` for more options.
