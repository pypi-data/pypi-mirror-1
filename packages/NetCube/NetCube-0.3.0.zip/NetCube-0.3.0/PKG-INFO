Description: 
        NetCube is a tool for visualizing network traffic in three dimensions.  It is
        inspired by the `Spinning Cube of Potential Doom`__ and was originally developed
        back in 2005.
        
        __ http://www.nersc.gov/nusers/security/TheSpinningCube.php
        
        NetCube requires:
        - pcapy (requires libpcap or winpcap)
        - OpenGL
        - pygame
        
        It uses pcapy to capture packets via libpcap allowing the use of the same
        filters used by tcpdump and part of Ethereal.  After capturing a packet, NetCube
        adds it to a list to be rendered as a pixel within a 3d cube.  Each axis
        corresponds to a different parameter of the packet.  At present these are the
        source address, the destination address, and the port number.  The color of the
        pixel corresponds to the vertical axis (port number) in order to make the
        diagram more readable as it rotates.
        
        A `quick start`__ guide is available for first time users and bug reports can be filed at the home page listed below.  For those who wish to find the unstable code, the development version is available from the `subversion trunk`__.  Be sure to run ``setup.py develop`` after checking out the code.
