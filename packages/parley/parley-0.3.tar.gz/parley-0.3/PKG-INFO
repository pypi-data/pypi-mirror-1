Description: 
        PARLEY is a library for writing Python programs that implement the Actor
        model of distributed systems, in which lightweight concurrent
        processes communicate through asynchronous message-passing. Actor
        systems typically are easier to write and debug than traditional
        concurrent programs that use locks and shared memory.
        
        PARLEY can run using either traditional native threads, greenlets
        (lightweight threads), or Stackless Python's tasklets. A program
        written using PARLEY can choose between these models by changing a
        single line of code.
