Description: This package provides an API to create integer ids for any object. Later
        objects can be looked up by their id as well. This functionality is commonly
        used in situations where dealing with objects is undesirably, such as in
        search indices or any code that needs an easy hash of an object.

        ------------------
        
        - Split out this package from ``zope.app.intid``. The latter one
        now only contains browser views and compatibility imports while
        whole IntId functionality is moved here.
