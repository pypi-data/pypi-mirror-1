Description: ===================
        five.hashedresource
        ===================
        
        While we want browsers to cache static resources such as CSS-stylesheets and
        JavaScript files, we also want them *not* to use the cached version if the
        files on the server have been updated. (And we don't want to make end-users
        have to empty their browser cache to get the latest version. Nor explain how
        to do that over the phone every time.)
        
        To make browsers update their caches of resources immediately when the
        resource changes, the absolute URLs of resources can now be made to contain a
        hash of the resource's contents, so it will look like
        /++noop++12345/@@/myresource instead of /@@/myresource.
        
        In developer mode the hash is recomputed each time the resource is asked for
        its URL, while in production mode the hash is computed only once, so remember
        to restart the server after changing resource files (else browsers will still
        see the old URL unchanged and use their outdated cached versions of the files).
        
        To use this package, include its configure.zcml and use
        `five.hashedresource.interfaces.IHashedResourceSkin` or a skin that inherits from
        it.
