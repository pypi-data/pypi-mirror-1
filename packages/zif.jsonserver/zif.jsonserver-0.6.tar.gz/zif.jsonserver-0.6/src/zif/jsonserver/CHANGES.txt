#CHANGES.txt

20051202 a bit of backward-compatibility with five:
    ++resource++ notation for the javascript.  updated to the available
    jsolait (2005-11-15.small)

20051125 some work toward making json requests better zope citizens.
Some work toward keyword parameter support.
Some work toward making more information available in request: now
provides IBrowserApplicationRequest. This is experimental.  Let me
know what you think.

20050921 Using the next beta of jsolait (20050914).  The init file is now
 jsolait.js instead of init.js.  jsolait installer adds init.js as a copy of
 jsolait.js for backwards compatibility.  We are now using the 3.1
 ResourceDirectory, so the jsolait file structure does not need to be flattened.
 Upgrade to this version of jsolait using the installer is optional.

20060511 Removed gzip support, since that can be done more elegantly by other
 means.  Preliminary support for json-rpc 1.1.
 
20060619 Fixed a few license headers.  Everything is pure ZPL now.  Updated 
 to match trunk, particularly ctheune's method from xmlrpc for removing proxies.
