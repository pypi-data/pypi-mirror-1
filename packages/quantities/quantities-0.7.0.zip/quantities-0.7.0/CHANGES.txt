0.7.0
-----

A critical problem was identified, caused by a conflict between farad
and Faraday identified in quantities <0.7. F is commonly used as a
symbol for both the farad and Faraday's constant. This is problematic
for quanitities, which registers its units so they can be accessed
using a string corresponding to the unit name or symbol. In this
case, the Faraday constant was registered after the farad, so any
quantity that was expressed in terms of farads would be incorrectly
simplified using the Faraday constant. This problem has been fixed
and the registry has been improved to prevent overwriting previously
registered names or symbols. F is now reserved for the farad.

Addition and subtraction of quantities with different but compatible
units is now supported. Additionally, changes have been made in the
forthcoming numpy-1.4.0 to extend this compatibility to other ufuncs
as well.

Numpydoc, an external package developed to extend Sphinx for the
numpy documentation project, is now required to build quantities'
documentation.
