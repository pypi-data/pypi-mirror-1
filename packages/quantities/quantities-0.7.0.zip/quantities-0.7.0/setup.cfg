long_description = Quantities is designed to handle arithmetic and conversions
	of physical quantities, which have a magnitude, dimensionality specified by
	various units, and possibly an uncertainty. Quantities builds on the popular
	numpy library and to support quantities. Quantities is designed to work with
	numpy's standard ufuncs, many of which are already supported. Quantities is
	actively developed, and while the current features and API are stable, test
	coverage is incomplete and the package is not ready for production use.
