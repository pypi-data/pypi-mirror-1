Description: 
        Quantities is designed to handle arithmetic and conversions of
        physical quantities, which have a magnitude, dimensionality specified
        by various units, and possibly an uncertainty. Quantities builds on
        the popular numpy library and to support quantities. Quantities is
        designed to work with numpy's standard ufuncs, many of which are
        already supported.
        
        Quantities is actively developed, and while the current features and
        API are stable, test coverage is incomplete and the package is not
        ready for production use.
