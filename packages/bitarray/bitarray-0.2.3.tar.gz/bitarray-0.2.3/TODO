* Write special tests for really large bitarrays, for which the length
  exceeds 2**31 bits

* write decode method

* Refactor huffman example, everything should be in one file.

* Test against Python 2.6

* Think about a search method which lets you search for sequences.
  - could also be used for, e.g.  bitarray('01') in bitarray('1111001101')
