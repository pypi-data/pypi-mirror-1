Write pack and unpack method which return 8 times larger buffer.
- Make example which shows interaction with numpy.

Reimplement more methods in C.
- in particular fromfile, pop, index

Implement bitwise operators.

Think about a search method which lets you search for sequences.
- could also be used for, e.g.  bitarray('01') in bitarray('1111001101')

Refactor huffman example, everything should be in one file.

Write special tests for really large bitarrays, for which the length
exceeds 2**32 bits.

Test against Python 2.6
