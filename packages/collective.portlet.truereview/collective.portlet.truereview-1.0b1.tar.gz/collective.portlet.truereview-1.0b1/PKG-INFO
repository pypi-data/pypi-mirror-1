Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package provides a new portlet, the "True review list", and an associated
        view, @@true_review_list.
        
        Unlike the regular review list portlet and view, it takes the "Review portal
        content" permission into account, via a custom indexer for a catalog index
        called 'reviewerRolesAndUsers'. Thus, it will only show content for which
        the current user has this permission. The portlet can also be limited to only
        show certain workflow states (defaulting to 'pending') and types.
        
        Note that it does not use worklists directly, so if you are relying on custom
        per-workflow worklists, you should still use the default portlet.
        
        Installation requires Plone 3.3. You will not need to install a ZCML slug -
        just add it to your buildout's 'eggs' list or as a new requirement in the
        setup.py of your product.
