PythonNURBS

PythonNURBS is the Python language binding for the NURBS++ library.
It consists of several Python Extensions, which provides methods for manipulation,
interpolation and transformation of Non Uniform Rational B-Spline curves and surfaces.

Dependency
============
Python 2.*
NURBS++-3.0.11 (http://libnurbs.sourceforge.net/download.shtml)
If you use a compiler newer than gcc-3.3* than you need an additional patch
(http://sourceforge.net/tracker/download.php?group_id=3254&atid=303254&file_id=169305&aid=1440970)
>=boost-1.34.1 with boost.python support (http://www.boost.org/libs/python/doc/)

Installation
============
Unpack the NURBS package and type (with administrator rights)
in the root directory of the NURBS package:

python setup.py install

For additional information, please have a look at the python documentation for Distutils.

Source Files
============
The raw source files were generated either with Pyste (http://www.boost.org/libs/python/pyste/) or
Py++ (http://www.language-binding.net/pyplusplus/pyplusplus.html). To get these raw source files
working a little polishing was needed. For both of them you will need at least gccxml-0.9
(ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/g/gccxml/gccxml_0.9.0+cvs20071228.orig.tar.gz)

At the moment the Python extension has up to 70% of the original implemented NURBS++ functionality.
Actually I've a lack of time to write the rest of the code.
So it's up to you to add some missing functionality to the PythonNURBS extension.
Don't hesitate to contact me, if you want to see your code here. ;-)

Builded Extensions
==================
The following extensions will be built and installed:

NurbsColor
NurbsCurveD
NurbsMatrixD
NurbsMatrixRTD
NurbsHPointD
NurbsPointD
NurbsSurfaceD
NurbsVectorD

Examples
========
These examples are shipped with the NURBS package:

curve01.py
interpolation01.py
surface01.py
test.py

License
=======
The PythonNURBS extension is distributed under the GNU GPL Version 3,
which can be found in the file 'LICENSE'.
Except the file src/__array_1.pypp.hpp, which was generated by Py++.
Thus this file is distributed under the Boost Software License Version 1.0,
which can be found in the file 'LICENSE_1_0.txt'.
