PythonNURBS

PythonNURBS is the Python language binding for the NURBS++ library.
It consists of several Python Extensions, which provides methods for
manipulation, interpolation and transformation of Non Uniform Rational
Basis Spline (NURBS) curves and surfaces.

Dependency
==========
Swig 1.3
Python 2.*
NURBS++-3.0.11 (http://libnurbs.sourceforge.net/download.shtml)

Installation
============
Unpack the NURBS package and type (with administrator rights)
in the root directory of the NURBS package:

python setup.py install

For additional information, please have a look at the python documentation for
Distutils.

Source Files
============

The wrapping of the python binding was done with Swig. You will find all
swig interface files in the src sub directory. At the moment the Python
extension has up to ~80% of the original implemented NURBS++ functionality. Some
Functions had been renamed and operators were wrapped into functions as well.
Actually I've a lack of time to write the rest of the code. So it's up to you to
add some missing functionality to the PythonNURBS extension. Don't hesitate to
contact me, if you want to see your code here. ;-)

Builded Extensions
==================
The following extensions will be built and installed:

NurbsArray2D
NurbsBasicArray
NurbsBasicList
NurbsColor
NurbsCoordinate
NurbsCurve
NurbsHPoint
NurbsMatrixRT
NurbsMatrix
NurbsPoint
NurbsSurface
NurbsVector

Examples
========
These examples are shipped with the PythonNURBS package:

curve01.py
interpolation01.py
interpolation01.py
surface01.py
surface02.py
test.py
vector_double.py

License
=======
The PythonNURBS extension is distributed under the GNU GPL Version 3,
which can be found in the file 'LICENSE'.
