Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        ``pydataportability.discovery`` is a component for discovering resource description
        documents. These are `XRD documents <http://code.google.com/p/webfinger/wiki/XrdFiles>`_ describing
        a resource and optionally pointing to related resources. One use case is the
        `webfinger project <http://code.google.com/p/webfinger/>`_ where XRD is used to store
        information about a user. The URI identifying the user is e.g. ``acct:user@example.com``
        and this discovery component is able to retrieve information about the user via
        `LRDD <http://hueniverse.com/2009/03/the-discovery-protocol-stack/>`_.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The easiest way to install it is via ``easy_install``::
        
        easy_install pydataportability.discovery
        
        It is recommended to do this inside a `virtualenv <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv/1.3.4>`_
        
        
        Simple usage
        ------------
        
        After installing you will have 2 new commands in your path (or virtualenv's ``bin/`` directory):
        ``discover`` and ``webfinger``. These are just example scripts though. Both do discovery
        on the URI you feed in but the latter will check for webfinger-relationships only and will
        additionally check if you passed in a user identifier starting with ``acct:`` which is the
        proposed scheme of the webfinger protocol. If you didn't, it's adding it for you.
        
        Here is an example::
        
        $ webfinger someuser@googlemail.com
        
        Subject:  acct:someuser@googlemail.com
        
        Rels:  ['http://portablecontacts.net/spec/1.0']
        URIs: ['http://www-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/api/people/']
        Media Types: []
        Prio: 0
        Templates: []
        
        So this mainly prints the contents of the discovered XRD document. Note that the
        user you are testing it with needs to enable this at Google. Check out the
        `webfinger homepage <http://code.google.com/p/webfinger/>`_ and
        `mailing list <http://groups.google.com/group/webfinger/>`_ for more information.
        
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        You can find the documentation for this component at http://dataportability.net
        
        .. warning:: Note that the XRD specification and the webfinger protocol are under heavy
        development and likely to change.
