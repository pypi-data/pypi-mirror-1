this is a moderately complex python3.0 script fully utilizing python2.6
extensions, & demonstrated to run under python2.6 via py3to2.
for performance, portions of it have been inlined w/ direct C code using
scipy.weave.  the algorithm also heavily uses bitwise operations.
it takes a jpeg, gif... image file & outputs it in colorized ascii art.
the actual purpose is for colorized 3-d scientific plotting in text
terminal (screenshots of image conversion & 3d plots in putty terminal
included)
