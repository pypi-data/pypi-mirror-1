The tiddlywebplugins.atom packages provide serialization modules to
do a very simple Atom format syndication of collections of tiddlers
(including one tiddler, and filtered tiddlers).

One serialization provides support for the Atom format, another
extends the existing HTML serialization to provide <link> elements
referring to the Atom feeds.

Atom formatted output can be had by requesting the application/atom+xml
format, or by appending a .atom to the end of a URL (before the query
portion) that returns one or more tiddlers.

To use this code instally the package and then add 'tiddlywebplugins.atom'
to system_plugins in the tiddlywebconfig.py of your instance:

config = {
    'system_plugins': ['tiddlywebplugins.atom'],
}

If differ.py[1] is on sys.path and a depth=<some number> argument is
supplied to the feed URL, then the resulting feed will be the tiddlers
requested presented as diffs between tiddler revisions. The number of
revisions shown is controlled by <some number>.

The Atom code is borrowed from Django's django/utils/feedgenerator.py
