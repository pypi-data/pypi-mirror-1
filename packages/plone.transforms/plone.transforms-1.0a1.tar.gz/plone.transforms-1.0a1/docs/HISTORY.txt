plone.transforms 1.0a1 - Released February 11, 2008

    - Removed the unfinished engine configuration which had a Zope2 dependency.
      [hannosch]

    - Added both the input_mimetype and output_mimetype values provided to the
      transform method of the engine to the options dictionary which is passed
      on to the individual transforms.
      
      For example multimedia transforms which can handle different formats can
      be implemented as single transforms this way, without having to guess the
      input format again.
      
      The output_mimetype can be useful in optimizing the transform result
      when a transform is used in a transform chain and the output format of
      the current transform is not the desired end result.

    - Initial design and work. Lots of work has been done on the Pastisprint
      in Aix-en-Provence in August 2007. Thx to atReal and Thierry Benita for
      organizing it and his whole family for hosting us.

      Special thanks to 'Focus-man' and his special powers which let us focus
      on the work ;)

      Also thanks to Google for its Summer of Code project which sponsored
      hannosch for his work.

      Kudos to Benjamin Saller, Sidnei da Silva and Sylvain Th√©nault for the
      PortalTransforms product which this work has been heavily based upon.
