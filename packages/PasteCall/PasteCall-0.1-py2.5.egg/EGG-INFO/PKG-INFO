Description: Paste Call
        ==========
        
        It is a `paste script`_ plugin that makes it possible to run custom commands from console. Example:
        
        ``$ paster call my.package:callable``
        
        Optionally it can take a WSGI application config file and load that application
        
        ``$ paster call my.package:callable --with-config=../production.cfg``
        
        Note that entry points will only be found if:
        
        - the config file is provided and/or
        - the project has been registered in the environment with
        ``$ python setup.py develop/install/etc``
