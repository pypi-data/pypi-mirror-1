0.1
* RestResource is a cherrypy lib

0.2
* avoiding 'index' incompatibility with later versions of CherryPy,
  the functions are renamed:
	create (instead of add),
	read (instead of index),
	update,
	delete
* crud defaults for Turbogears with a SQLObject bridge
* added ';' support a la wsgicollection:
  http://bitworking.org/news/wsgicollection

0.3
* fixed ';' support for more corner cases
* REST_ids_are_root = True|False option for different ';' url schemes
  (Are ids or attributes the resource parameters after the ';'?)
* crud rearranged and simplified for easier form-fields modification
* collections and resources now redirect to include '/' for
  better consistancy on relative-url form submission

0.4
* fix: getresource() sends tuple rather than first letter
* CRUD.py foreignfields not hidden, documentation, SOController tidying
