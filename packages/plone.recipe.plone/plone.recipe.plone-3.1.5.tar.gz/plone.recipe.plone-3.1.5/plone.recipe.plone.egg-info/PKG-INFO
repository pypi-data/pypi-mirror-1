Description: This recipe allows you to install Plone, based on the packages used for the
        Plone installers.
        
        Here is an example buildout::
        
        [buildout]
        parts = plone zope2 instance
        eggs =
        develop =
        
        [plone]
        recipe = plone.recipe.plone
        
        [zope2]
        recipe = plone.recipe.zope2install
        url = ${plone:zope2-url}
        
        [instance]
        recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
        zope2-location = ${zope2:location}
        user = admin:admin
        http-port = 8080
        debug-mode = on
        verbose-security = on
        eggs =
        ${buildout:eggs}
        ${plone:eggs}
        zcml =
        
        products =
        ${plone:products}
        ${buildout:directory}/products
        
        Notice how the 'plone' recipe is able to supply a URL for a "known good"
        version of Zope (you can of course choose not to use it).
        
        The 'instance' recipe is configured with two parameters set by the 'plone'
        recipe:
        
        plone:eggs -- The various Plone eggs
        
        plone:products -- A directory containing the Plone Zope 2 products
        
        Other possible options in the 'plone' section include:
        
        eggs -- Override the eggs used by Plone. If you specify an egg here that is
        also part of the standard Plone distribution, the specified egg will
        override the default. For example, if you want to track svn for a
        particular egg, check it out to the src/ directory, add a line to
        'develop' in buildout (e.g. "develop = src/plone.theme" to track the
        plone.theme package) and then add "eggs = plone.theme" to the 'plone'
        section. Alternatively, if you need to upgrade or downgrade a particular
        egg, you can do so with a version specification.
        
        find-links -- Specify one or more find-links for setuptools to download
        eggs from. By default, this includes http://dist.plone.org and any
        find-links specified in the main [buildout] section.
        
        urls -- A list of URLs to download packages from, overriding those from the
        installer configuration. You can use the options 'nested-packages' and
        'version-suffix-packages' to give the names of download archives which
        contain a parent directory and the actual product in a sub directory,
        and products which when extracted have a directory containing the version
        number. See plone.recipe.distros for more information.
        
        zope2-url -- Override the Zope 2 URL from the installer (not that there is
        much point in doing so).
