        History of plonehrm.jobperformance
        ==================================
        
        
        1.0.5 (2009-05-29)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed substitution when using a global instead of local template.
        [maurits]
        
        
        1.0.4 (2009-05-28)
        ------------------
        
        - Added a listTemplates method to the JobPerformanceTool, which lists
        the templates in this tool.  Optionally this lists the templates
        from a higher level portal_jobperformance tool as well.  This is
        done by trying to call getUseHigherLevelTool on the current tool.
        This method is not available by default, but can be implemented by
        third party products.  Default is False.  If you always want this to
        be True, add a python script getUseHigherLevelTool in the
        portal_skins/custom folder that just returns True.
        [maurits]
        
        - The JobPerformanceTool is no longer a unique object, which means you
        can add this tool for example inside a WorkLocation (from the ZMI or
        with some custom python code) so you can have job performance
        templates specific for this WorkLocation.  [maurits]
        
        
        1.0.3 (2009-05-26)
        ------------------
        
        - Gave the date of Job Performance Interviews a default of today.  At
        least handy for plonehrm.absence.  (BTW, we might want to make this
        field required.)  [maurits+vincent]
        
        - Added main_date property to Job Performance Interview, which is
        wanted by plonehrm.absence.  [maurits+vincent]
        
        
        1.0.2 (2009-05-15)
        ------------------
        
        - Added a link from the jobperformance page to the employee.
        [maurits+vincent]
        
        - Removed .mo files from locales.  This means those translations will
        not be visible in the old Plone 3.0.  [maurits]
        
        
        1.0.1 (2009-04-16)
        ------------------
        
        - Use collective.autopermission to register permissions.
        [maurits]
        
        - Set end-of-line style as native and set svn:ignore.  [maurits]
        
        
        1.0 (2008-10-02)
        ----------------
        
        - Changed control panel icon to group.gif (which reminds a bit more of
        human resource management, at least better than the site icon that
        was used previously).  [maurits]
        
        
        1.0 beta 2 (2 September 2008)
        -----------------------------
        
        - No changes recorded.
        
        
        1.0 beta 1 (13 December 2007)
        -----------------------------
        
        - Initial beta release.
