Description: 
        The Aglyph Dependency Injection framework for Python aims to be as non-intrusive as possible, allowing for relatively painless integration into existing applications.  Every component of Aglyph is pluggable so that the framework can function with out-of-the-box default components or be extended to address the specific needs of a project.  In addition to user-defined types (old- or new-style classes), almost every standard Python type can be represented in XML notation, avoiding kludgy and insecure eval()s.  Aglyph supports lazy and eager evaluation of arguments (both constructor and setter), and the notion of singleton and prototype components.
