Description: 
        simpleweb is a result of working closely with web.py, TurboGears, Django,
        and a very hefty dose of opinionation(tm) :)
        
        Like TurboGears, it builds on existing python and wsgi components,
        to keep things simple, and just connects these components in a very
        easy transparent way.
        
        Like web.py its dispatching mechanism is matched strictly to HTTP methods.
        
        Like Django, its built for building deadline(s)-oriented(tm) applications.
        As such, working with simpleweb will have a certain sense of deja-vu if you've
        worked much Django, there are differences ofcourse, but the general feel is
        the same.
