Description: Extensions for the Zope 3 testbrowser
        =====================================
        
        This package is intended to provide extended versions of the Zope 3
        testbrowser. Especially those extensions that introduce dependencies to more
        external products, like lxml.

        1.0.3
        ~~~~~
        
        - Remedy brown-bag 1.0.2-release: Someone already released 1.0.2-r* instead of
        a .dev release making the 1.0.2 final too old. :/
        
        1.0.2
        ~~~~~
        
        - Helping libxml2 with some encoding guesswork.
