0.6.0 (2009-09-20)
------------------

- Bugfix: Criterium didn't get correct located in SearchFilter. The criterium
  __name__ was allways an empty unicode value.

- Bugfix: The criterim filter didn't work with more then one criterium used.
  The search form now locates the filter form and will set a individual prefix
  for the criterium form. If you use a custom criterium form, you probably 
  have to review your custom implementation. Especialy review the prefix setup
  in the setupCriteriumRows method.

- adjust tests, reflect latest changes and fix element attribute order which
  get changed in z3c.form
