3.5.2 (2009-02-04)
------------------

- Split RootPhysicallyLocatable adapter back from LocationPhysicallyLocatable,
  because the IRoot object may not always provide ILocation and the code
  for the root object is also simplier. It's basically a copy of the
  RootPhysicallyLocatable adapter from zope.traversing version 3.5.0 and
  below with ``getParents`` method added (returns an empty list).

3.5.1 (2009-02-02)
------------------

- Improve test coverage.

- The new ``getParents`` method was extracted from ``zope.traversing``
  and added to ILocationInfo interface in the previous release. Custom
  ILocationInfo implementations should make sure they have this method
  as well. That method is already used in ``zope.traversing.api.getParents``
  function.

- Make ``getName`` of LocationPhysicallyLocatable always return empty
  string for the IRoot object, like RootPhysicallyLocatable from
  ``zope.traversing`` did. So, now LocationPhysicallyLocatable is
  fully compatible with RootPhysicallyLocatable, making the latter one
  obsolete.

- Change package mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org instead
  of retired zope3-dev at zope.org.

3.5.0 (2009-01-31)
------------------

- Reverse the dependency between zope.location and zope.traversing. This
  also causes the dependency to various other packages go away.

3.4.0 (2007-10-02)
------------------

- Initial release independent of the main Zope tree.
