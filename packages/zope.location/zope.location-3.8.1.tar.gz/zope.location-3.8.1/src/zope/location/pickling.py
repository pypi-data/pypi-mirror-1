    """Copy hook to preserve copying referenced objects that are not
    located inside object that's being copied.

    To see the problem, imagine we want to copy an ILocation object that
    contains an attribute-based reference to another ILocation object
    and the referenced object is not contained inside object being copied. 
    
    Without this hook, the referenced object will be cloned:
    
    >>> from zope.location.location import Location, locate
    >>> root = Location()
    >>> page = Location()
    >>> locate(page, root, 'page')
    >>> image = Location()
    >>> locate(page, root, 'image')
    >>> page.thumbnail = image
    
    >>> from zope.copy import copy
    >>> page_copy = copy(page)
    >>> page_copy.thumbnail is image
    False

    But if we will provide a hook, the attribute will point to the
    original object as we might want.

    >>> from zope.component import provideAdapter
    >>> provideAdapter(LocationCopyHook)

    >>> from zope.copy import copy
