        ===============
        
        This package is my grab bag of patches to GS and portal_quickinstaller
        I use in my client work.  It is unstable, unpolished, subject to my
        whim, and really should be experimental.gsqi.  If, however, the same
        GenericSetup and portal_quickinstaller quirks and bugs bother you, or
        the same conveniences are of value to you, you might want to look at
        whats in it.
        
        - Fix `import of group roles
        <http://dev.plone.org/collective/browser/collective.gsqi/trunk/collective/gsqi/workflow/exportimport.py>`_
        during workflow import
        
        - Fix `circular import handler dependencies
        <http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8350>`_ bug
        
        - Fix portal_quickinstaller so that `persistent data is not lost
        <http://dev.plone.org/collective/browser/collective.gsqi/trunk/collective/gsqi/qi.py>`_
        on reinstall
        
        Also included are a number of perhaps naughty extensions to the CMF
        content import handler.
        
        - Permissive registrations of the StructureFolderWalkingAdapter so
        that folders under the profile's "structure" folder with the same
        name as in the container's .objects file can be used to import any
        kind of content object, not just folders.  This allows, amongst
        other things, creating topics/collections and criteria on import.
        
        - Set arbitrary AT fields on import using the options under the
        [FIELDS] section of .properties as field names and the option
        values as field values.  If field.multiValued is True, then the
        option value will be split on newlines and each value stripped.
        
        - Reindex imported objects so that imported titles, descriptions,
        and any other AT fields are reflected in the catalog and portal
        navigation after import.
        
        - Set local roles on import where each option under the [ROLES]
        section of .properties is the principal/user id and the roles
        assigned to that principal are taken from the option value split
        at newlines with each item stripped.
        
        - Do each workflow transition listed under the "transitions" option
        of the [DEFAULT] section of .properties.  The option value is
        split at newlines with each item stripped.
        
        - Set display layout using the layout option in the [DEFAULT]
        section of .properties
        
        Here's a sample .properties file demonstrating all these extensions::
        
        [DEFAULT]
        title = News and Events
        description = Site News and Events
        transitions = publish
        layout = aggregator
        
        [ROLES]
        Marketers = Contributor
        
        [FIELDS]
        excludeFromNav = True
        constrainTypesMode = 1
        locallyAllowedTypes =
        Event
        News Iem
        immediatelyAddableTypes =
        Event
        News Iem
        
        Also included is `GSML <http://rpatterson.net/blog/gsml>`_ which
        allows implementing GS import handlers as you would implement ZCML
        directive handlers.  Some import handlers are included in
        collective.gsqi that make use of GSML.
        
        - A `groups import handler
        <http://dev.plone.org/collective/browser/collective.gsqi/trunk/collective/gsqi/group/README.txt>`_
        
        - A `references import handler
        <http://dev.plone.org/collective/browser/collective.gsqi/trunk/collective/gsqi/refs/meta.py>`_
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.3 - 2009-08-23
        ----------------
        
        * More permissive StructureFolderWalkingAdapter registration
        * Use AT field set method directly so that mode 'r' fields can still
        be imported
        * Add support for setting content display layout on GS content import
        
        0.2 - 2009-06-27
        ----------------
        
        * Make the content properties importers apply even when the content
        already exists.  IOW, hook into the importer rather than into
        makeInstance.
        
        * Add support for importing AT references
        
        * Incorporate fixes for http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8350 from
        b_mathieu.
        
        * Add support for importing groups
        
        * Fix handling of profiles with XML for a given step
        
        * Add support for ZCML based GenericSetup import handlers
        
        * Fix DCWokflow's exportimport handling of groups
        
        0.1 - 2009-04-07
        ----------------
        
        * Initial release
