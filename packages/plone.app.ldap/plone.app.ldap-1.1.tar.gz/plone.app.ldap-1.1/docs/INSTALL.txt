Installation
============

Requirements
------------

simplon.plone.ldap requires a number of python packages and Zope products:

 * Plone 3.0 or later
 * The python-ldap_ python package. For Linux and BSD systems this is generally
   easily available through the packaging or ports system. The python-ldap homepage
   has instructions for other operation systems.
 * LDAPUserFolder_ version 2.8 or later. This should be installed
   in the Products folder of your Zope instance.
 * LDAPMultiPlugins_ version 1.5 or later. This should be installed
   in the Products folder of your Zope instance.
 * PloneLDAP_ version 1.0 or later. This should be installed
   in the Products folder of your Zope instance.

Installing the package
----------------------

To install simplon.plone.ldap you will first need to install it in the python
path used for by your Zope instance. This can be done using the setup script::

    python setup.py install --home /path/to/zope/instance

Next you will need to instruct Zope to load simplon.plone.ldap on startup. To do
this create a file in the ``etc/package-includes`` directory of your instance
with the name ``simplo.plone.ldap-configure.zcml`` with this content:

    <include package="simplon.plone.ldap" />

After (re)starting Zope you should now see an 'LDAP Support' product in
the `Add/Remove Products` page in your Plone site setup.
