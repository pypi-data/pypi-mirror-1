Installation

 eCards installs like any standard Plone add-on Product.

  - Unpack the tarball in your Zope instance's Products directory. (Be sure it has the correct permissions.)
  - Restart your Zope instance.
  - Use the Add/Remove Programs control panel in your Plone Site or portal_quickinstaller in the ZMI to install the product.
  
Setup

 - You need to configure Site --> Mail Settings to point to a 
   properly configured, running mail server for the eCards to be sent
   
   With OS X, this is as simple as typing "sudo service smtp start" within
   a terminal window.  For other OS, you're on your own for mail server setup.
