        Compatibility
        ***************
        
        * Plone 3.x-series, if you need to use eCards with version 2.5.x, see
        http://plone.org/products/ecards/releases/1.0
        
        Overview
        ***************
        
        For site managers:
        
        * Addition of new content type "eCard Collection" which can contain selected eCards
        * "eCard" content type that contains the image and an option thumbnail for overriding
        the default generated thumbnail
        * Configuration of layout of eCard Collection view, to suit variable site design widths
        (i.e. choose the number of eCards in a row, which will not overextend the main content area)
        * Configuration of a "pull" message appended to the end of each email that raises awareness about
        the organization hosting the eCard application where the eCard was sent.
        
        For site users:
        
        * User can choose amongst multiple eCards from a thumbnail gallery, as uploaded by the site managers
        * Users can add a personalized message to their eCards.
        * Cards are emailed to recipients.
        
        Fully customizable templates
        
        * ecardcollection_view - a page that includes HTML content, a
        thumbnail gallery of eCards, and email settings.
        * ecardpopup_view - loaded when an eCard is chosen from the collection view, includes the full sized eCard image,
        a byline for the image, and HTML email message to be appended (see above), the form fields required for the user
        to send the email.
        * email_template - contains the HTML-rich email template that gets sent out to include the
        chosen eCard and custom message.  Note: we're passing several variables via options dictionary.  If you want to include
        additional "dynamic" data in your email template, you'll need to customize ecardsuccess.cpy as well.
        
        You can customize these templates via the ZMI or on the filesystem to match your site's branding.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        (svn/unreleased)
        ----------------
        
        - TBD [developer's name in brackets]
        
        1.1rc1 (2008.11.10)
        --------------------------------
        
        - Tweaking actions for eCardCollections and eCards items to take maximize impact of
        efficient tabber user inteface (i.e. no longer need properties tab) and the fact
        that sharing is now a global action
        (see: http://plone.org/documentation/manual/upgrade-guide/version/2.5-3.0/products).
        Other minimal cleanup [andrewb]
        
        - Changed schemata name "Email Settings" for the eCardCollection content object. In a
        nutshell, multiple word schemata's are a bad idea when pared with the new tabber
        user interface. In addition to having it's own schemata, our two word schemata fields
        also appear in a separate fieldset on the default page.  I didn't have time to investigate
        the root cause and Google didn't turn up results, so we take this workaround of a
        renamed schema [andrewb]
        
        - Utilizing Plone 3.x viewlet managers for control of template elements like: document
        actions, above content body items, etc.  If the ecardcollection_view is customized
        and you're upgrading eCards, see the following changeset for what should be merged
        within your custom template:
        http://dev.plone.org/collective/changeset/75433 [andrewb]
        
        - Pulling as much installation boilerplate and cruft out of Extension/Install.py and
        into Generic Setup profiles as is currently feasible. Still maintain an Install
        module with uninstall method because as of CMFQI version 2.1.6 we don't have a
        convention for looking for an appropriate uninstall profile and InstalledProduct
        instances don't fully clean-up like we want [andrewb]
        
        - In previous releases of eCards we were essentially hand rolling the necessary block
        of text required to send an HTML email.  Because this is a profoundly bad idea and
        quite fragile, the structuring of the emailing is now done in a helper method within
        browser.py utilizing Python's email message module.  The aim is to let
        people freely customize "email_template.pt" within the ecards_template
        skin folder.  This should be pretty future proof.  Because branding of the full eCard
        experience is pretty important, if you also needed to customize send_ecard.cpy,
        you may need to merge your modifications with the updated code base.  See the following
        changeset for help: http://dev.plone.org/collective/changeset/75168
        [andrewb, thanks to mborch & collective.singing for inspiration]
        
        - Updates to ecardpopup_view.pt and ecardpopup_thanks.pt. Bringing in line with the plone.htmlhead
        viewlet.  Again, because customization of skin layers is pretty critical and it's quite likely
        that the ecardpopup_view.pt and ecardpopup_thanks.pt were customized if you're
        upgrading to eCards 1.1, you'll want to merge the following changes into your
        customizations: http://dev.plone.org/collective/changeset/75162
        Please keep in mind that old versions of these templates no longer work with
        Plone 3.x because of the lack of a header.pt within the skin layer [andrewb]
        
        - Code updates and refactoring for Plone 3.x compliance.  Plone 2.5.x no longer actively
        maintained, though patches that maintain compatibility in both releases happily accepted.
        Thanks to mborch for all initial work [andrewb, mborch]
        
        1.0 final (2008.11.6)
        --------------------------------
        
        - fixed image transparency for type icon used for the eCard Collection folderish type.
        Requires updating the 'content_icon' value within an eCardCollection's
        portal_type listing from 'ecardcollection_icon.jpg' to 'ecardcollection_icon.gif'.  This can
        either be achieved with product reinstall or by manually changing the value within the
        types tool [andrewb, thanks to jboese]
        
        - fixed http://plone.org/products/ecards/issues/12, whereby the eCard collection
        view doesn't account for position in its parent collection for a given eCard [andrewb]
        
        - fixed http://plone.org/products/ecards/issues/10, whereby the eCardCollection
        content objects within a site were not reorderable within their parent folder.
        Requires updating the 'Product Meta Type' value within an eCardCollection's
        portal_type listing from 'eCardCollection' to 'ECardCollection'.  This can either
        be achieved with product reinstall or by manually changing the value within the
        types tool [andrewb]
        
        1.0 release candidate 1 (2007.10.15)
        -------------------------------------
        
        - fixed issue where main page reloaded after clicking on popup link [davidg]
        - fixed Javascript error with popups in IE7 [davidg]
        
        1.0 beta 1
        --------------------------------
        
        - Pulling HTML email out of cpy, so that it's a designer, rather than a developer task to (thanks davidg and jbaldivieso)
        - Adding feature to allow content editors to choose their desired thumbnail size for the collection view,
        cleaned up language on the various fields that impact this behavior (thanks davidg and vedawms)
        - Fixing bug where the popup ecard template was a fixed width, rather than based upon
        the width of the actual uploaded image
        - Registering custom permission, protecting the sending of email by that permission
        - Protecting the send_ecard success action with validation, so it's harder to abuse
        with a GET REQUEST (not relevant for Plone 3.0+, but important for earlier Plone versions)
        - Ensuring product winzip capable with non-empty __init__.py files
        
        1.0 alpha 2
        --------------------------------
        
        - registering css resource with styles that can be customized within
        site-specific theme product
        - cleaning up templates so that they more Plone-like in their use of style
        and html structure
        - displaying all fields that will go into the email in the pop-up template
        - fixing bug in eCard type generic setup profile causing the view action
        to go directly to the index_html method, rather than the view alias
        
        1.0 alpha 1
        --------------------------------
        
        - initial import of content types and skins from working code on snowleopard.org
        - addition of comprehensive test suite of all no ZPT, CMFFormController code
        to ensure quality control going forward
