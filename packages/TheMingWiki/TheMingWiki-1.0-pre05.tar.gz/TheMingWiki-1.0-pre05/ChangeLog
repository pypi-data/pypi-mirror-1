	* release: 1.0-pre05

	* PageFormatter.py (PageFormatter._url_split): refactored and
	fixed the logic of removing punctuation from urls and mailtos.

	* design: Moving all Page knowledge to Page class so that I can
	optionally have a site template and a single method to fill it.

	* design: Cleaning up the namespace.  Page's name is now PageName
	throughout. A page is a page.  A rose is a rose is a rose.  And I
	am I because my little dog knows me.

	* release: 1.0-pre04

2006-10-06  Billy-Bob Ming  <billy-bob@billy-bob-ming.com>

	* LibWiki.py (LibWiki.send_title): Wrapping page content in a
	95% width table to bring it off the edges.  Table closed in
	LibWiki.print_footer

	* PageFormatter.py (PageFormatter._url_repl): Parsing for "|" so
	that you can either enter http://xyz and see http://xyz or
	http://xyz|abc and see abc.

	* release: 1.0-pre03.  This version is now safe enough and stable
	enough to be on our web.  And that's where it is.

	* cleanup: several little fixes and tweaks.

	* release: 1.0-pre02

	* security: added INCOMING_MAX constant to control the size
	of submissions from the Edit Page textarea.  Currently set
	at 8kb.

	* security: added usr/pwd authentication for edit-access to
	pages. User password combinations are in wiki/access.txt.  Public
	pages which do not require authentication are in wiki/public.txt.

	* locks: added Marco Rimoldi's locking code from the Ming Server's
	Lib3.py to LibWiki.py.  This should prevent any overwriting
	problems because only one user can aquire the lock to a file (we
	hope).

	* release: 1.0-pre01

2006-10-05  Billy-Bob Ming  <billy-bob@billy-bob-ming.com>

	* security: removed GoTo macro which would allow anyone to create
	empty pages.  It seems to me that new pages should only come from
	the context of another page's context anyway. But perhaps I'm
	over-intellectualizing.

	* design: sorted out what was public and private method-wise.

	* design: moved all read/write calls to LibWiki object in
	preparation for introducing the lock code from Marco's Ming Server
	work.

	* release: initial 0.1 release of The Ming Wiki This release is
	simply the original piki broken out into its component classes.
