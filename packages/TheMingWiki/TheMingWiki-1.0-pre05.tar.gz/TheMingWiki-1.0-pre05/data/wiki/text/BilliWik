BilliWik is packaged as The Ming Wiki
and is a fork of Piki
( http://www.linuxcare.com.au/piki/ )
by MartinPool.

We forked it because they've been neglecting the poor thing.
We began by busting it out into its proper classes.
Classes want their own individuality.  

I know -- let's start a BilliWikToDo page.
