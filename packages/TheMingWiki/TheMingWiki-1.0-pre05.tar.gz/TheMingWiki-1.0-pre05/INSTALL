The Ming Wiki Installation Guide
==================================

The Easy Way
------------

Run the following command from a shell prompt:

	python setup.py install

A user-friendly script will guide you through the installation
procedure, prompting you to choose where you'd like to install
each package component.


The Hard Way
------------

Should the 0.1 setup.py not do for you, here's all there is to it:

billiwik.cgi should be in your cgibin dir, perms 755.  It should
correctly point to the wiki data dir, the css file, and the logo jpeg.
Put those where you want them.  Make sure _ALL_ the path definitions in
billiwik.cgi work for you.

The directory called TheMingWiki should also be in your cgibin, just as
it comes in the package.

The data/wiki directory should go onto your server where the server
(often user "nobody") can read _AND_ create _AND_ write files.

With the above, you should be able to hit /cgibin/billiwik.cgi with a
browser and get the front page of the wiki.

Write me if you cain't.
