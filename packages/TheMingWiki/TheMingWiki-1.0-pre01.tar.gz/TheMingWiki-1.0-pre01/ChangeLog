	* security: removed GoTo macro which would allow anyone to create
	empty pages.  It seems to me that new pages should only come from
	the context of another page's context anyway. But perhaps I'm
	over-intellectualizing.

	* design: sorted out what was public and private method-wise.

	* design: moved all read/write calls to LibWiki object in
	preparation for introducing the lock code from Marco's Ming Server
	work.

	* release: initial 0.1 release of The Ming Wiki This release is
	simply the original piki broken out into its component classes.
