Names of pages have to be WikiWords, which are apparently explained elsewhere.

Be aware that BilliWik does not lock pages during editing, so if you pause for a long time on the edit screen you may overwrite somebody else's changes.
This may happen without pausing.  Or not at all.  Race conditions, human
or digital, are indeterminate.  We'll fix this soon.  See BilliWikToDo.

Anyway ...

Leave blank lines between paragraphs.

You can also write ''italics'' and '''bold'''.
To write italics, enclose the text in double single quotes.
To write bold, enclose the text in triple single quotes.
If you can't figure out what I mean, click the Edit-Text link below
to look at the source for this page.

If you indent text

  like this, then it is indented in the output

    you can have multiple levels of indent

And if you put asterisks at the start of the line

  * you get a 
  * bulleted
  * list
    * which can also be indented
      * to several levels

To insert program source without reformatting in a monospace font, use three curly braces:

{{{
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    out.println("Hello");
  }
}}}

Just like that.
