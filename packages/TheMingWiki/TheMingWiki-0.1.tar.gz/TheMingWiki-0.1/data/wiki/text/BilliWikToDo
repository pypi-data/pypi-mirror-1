Add to the top of this page features you think are missing in BilliWik:

 * locks to prevent overwrites

 * user/passwd access to edit

 * safeguards on editing

 * list of open edit pages (ie sandbox)

The following are the original authors' suggestions that seem to still apply.

 * Find a better logo. 

 * Find a way to attach images to uploaded pages.

 * Implement backups as in http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MoreAboutBackupCopies

 * Show most-often-read pages.

 * Clear up the few inconsistencies between normal and magic pages like RecentChanges.  In Original-Wiki they do this by magic markup tags inside the pages, rather than by trapping the names.  This is nice: amongst other things, it means that people can easily and consistently add documentation/explanation to those pages.

 * Merge implementations of Full-Search and Title-Search

 * Full-Search should also search titles
