WikiWords are also known as camel words because they have
humps in them.  Whenever you edit a wiki and use a word that has
capital letters in the middle, the wiki software assumes you 
wish to have a page with that word as its title and
includes that camel word in its links.  You can browse to the page before 
it  has content and its default content has the EditText link
(see below) to let you add real content.
