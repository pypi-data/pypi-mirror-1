Description: The Object HTTP Mapper provides tools both to expose your objects as
        WSGI applications, and to create objects with attributes that delegate
        to web requests.
        
        Objects are generally containers, with attributes as resources in
        those containers.  The resources are not homogenous -- one might be a
        JSON object, another XML, another a string.  HTTP methods (``GET``,
        ``PUT``, ``DELETE``) are used to get, set, and delete attributes.
        
        This project is in a `subversion repository
        <http://svn.pythonpaste.org/Paste/OHM/trunk#egg=OHM-dev>`_ and the
        development version can be installed with ``easy_install OHM==dev``.
        Interested users should probably follow the development.
