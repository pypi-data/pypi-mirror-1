[ ] portal_status_message (ploneflashupload.js) is used in the pre
    3.0-way. This will need to be changed to the new cookie-based mechanism.

[x] DONE: Actions ought to be added with generic setup. The way that
    ploneflashupload adds the actions now doesn't even show up in the 3.0
    portal_actions user interface :-) If you export the actions to
    genericsetup you'll see the action alright, including the differences.

[x] DONE: Look if you can build/grab an egg of just the zope flashupload
    widget. The current sys.path hack wreaks havoc if you try to include
    another z3c.* egg. (Solution: turn the entire product into an egg!)
