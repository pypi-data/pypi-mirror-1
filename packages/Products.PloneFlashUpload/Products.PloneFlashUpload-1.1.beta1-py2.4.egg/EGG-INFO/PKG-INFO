Description: Plone Flash Upload
        ==================
        
        Plone Flash Upload is a Plone add-on product which adds an upload tab to
        folders which takes the user to an upload form.  This upload form uses a flash
        applet to provide the ability to upload multiple files simultaneously.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        The 1.1 version only works on plone 3.0. Also you'll apparently need zope
        2.10.5 as otherwise lib/python packaged can't be in the Products namespace.
        
        * Zope 2.10.5+
        * Plone 3.0.x
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Option one: use buildout and specify 'Products.PloneFlashUpload' as an egg
        dependency. (Or depend on it in your own product's setup.py).
        
        Option two: simply extract downloaded archive into the
        ``$INSTANCE_HOME/lib/python`` directory and (re)start Zope.
        
        Once Zope is running, go to the Plone site's *Add/Remove Products*
        configuration screen and install the *PloneFlashUpload* product.
        
        Basic Usage
        -----------
        
        After installation of the product is complete, go to any folder within the
        plone site and a new *upload* tab should be present if the current user has
        access to add new files to the folder.
        
        Additional Notes
        ----------------
        
        - The flash applet has been tested (and runs successfully) on MSIE6, MSIE7,
        Firefox 1.5 (WinXP), Firefox 2.0 (WinXP/Linux) and various Safari and
        Firefox versions on MacOSX.  If a particular browser is found not to work,
        please submit an issue to the issue tracker.
        
        - Any file that is uploaded will try to use the content type registry to
        determine what portal type should be the result of the file being uploaded
        (ie jpg's created as Image's and random binary files created as File's).  It
        should be observed though that only portal types defined within the PFU
        configlet are possible candidates (ie add more here if you have additional
        custom types you are using and have registered with CTR).
