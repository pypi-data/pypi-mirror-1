Description: Welcome to ATExtensions
        =======================
        
        This package provides some further fields and widgets
        for archetypes as used by Plone.
        
        Most generic are the RecordField/Widget (effectively
        handling a dictionary) and the RecordsField/Widget
        (handling a list of records). The  most advanced
        application thereof are the FormattableName(s) fields
        and widgets.
        
        To demonstrate their usage, there are demo content types
        called 'WorkingGroup' and 'FormattbleNameDemo' which
        can be installed using the packages 'demotypes' profile.
        To enable the types after install, go to portal types and
        make them implicitly addable or include
        them in some folderish type's 'allowed_content_types'.
        
        ATExtensions are installable in the Plone 2.1, 2.5,
        and 3.0 series.
        
        Enjoy,

        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.9.5 (2008/11/04)
        ------------------
        
        * Saner default for the LabeledUrlWidget when there
        is no URL given (not linking anywhere now). [raphael]
        
        * Changed 'toPortalTime' to 'toLocalizedTime' in the datatime
        widget (how did that survive?). [raphael]
        
        * Renamed the old Extensions/Install to Extensions/plone2Install
        From now on the profile should be used.
        People in need of the old behavior can revert the renaming.

        0.9.4
        ------------------
        
        * Added the LabeledUrlField/Widget combo.
        This is an example of a record field holding a 'label'
        and a 'url' key where in view mode the 'lable' is used
        as text for the anchor to url. [raphael]
        
        0.9.3 (2008/05/20)
        ------------------
        
        * First release as egg [aclark]
