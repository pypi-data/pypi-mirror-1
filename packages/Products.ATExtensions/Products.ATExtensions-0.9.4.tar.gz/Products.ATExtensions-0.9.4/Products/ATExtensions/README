Welcome to ATExtensions


This package provides some further fields and widgets
for archetypes.

So far, the Record(s)Field/Widget are the most generic 
ones and the FormattableName(s) are the most advanced
application thereof.


To demonstrate usage, there are demo content types 
called 'WorkingGroup' and 'FormattbleNameDemo'. 
To enable it after install, go to portal types and 
make them implicitly addable or include 
it in some folderish type's 'allowed_content_types'
(old way) or load the demo profile (new way).

ATExtensions are installable in the Plone 2.1, 2.5,
and 3.0 series.

Enjoy,
