This picture shows the band "Plone" (who invented the imaginary word Plone) and
was taken by Alan Farmer from Bearos Records in 1997 for the
"We Brought Our Friends" booklet.
All rights of the picture remain to Alan Farmer.

See the response to my request to Alan Farmer:
"""
Hi Johannes
There is no licence for the photos.
I took them myself in 1997 for the "We Brought Our Friends" booklet and I've
since put the interviews on the website.
I assume you've been in touch with Mike or Billy in order to use the name
Plone. If they have no concerns I'm happy for you to use the pictures if you
can give me a credit.
Alan Farmer
