Description: bda.contentproxy
        ================
        
        Module providing some flavour of content proxy for Plone. It works for all
        kind of Archetypes.
        
        Consider that the Archetypes UID must be present in the portal_catalog
        (default in plone 3) and the view for the Type must come along with
        a 'main' macro in it's view, i.e.
        
        <metal:main fill-slot="main">
        <tal:main-macro metal:define-macro="main">
        
        <!-- type view goes here -->
        
        </tal:main-macro>
        </metal:main>
        
        This macro is called on the proxied content and is inserted into the 'main'
        slot of the main_template in the current context.
        
        2 Kinds of proxy behaviour are provided:
        
        A placeless proxy. This is a simple BrowserView named 'proxy', with its own
        traverser resolving the trailing part of the URL as the Archetype UID, i.e.
        
        http://your.domain.net/some/path/@@proxy/0c6e067822a520eabcfdd1e67d209d96
        
        The other way is a simple Archetype with a UID reference field.
        
        The first kind of proxy may takes place when rendering search results,
        the other one might be used to insert 'remote' content to a specified place
        in the folder hirarchy.
