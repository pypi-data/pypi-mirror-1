Description: 
        Spiff Guard is a library implementing generic access lists for Python.
        It was designed to provide a clean API, high security and high
        scalability. Working with an ACL is as simple as this:
        
        ::
        
        from Guard import *
        guard   = DB(db_connection)
        group   = ResourceGroup("My Group")
        user    = Resource("My User")
        website = ResourceGroup("My Website")
        view    = Action("View")
        write   = Action("Edit")
        guard.register_type([Resource, ResourceGroup, Website])
        guard.add_action([view, write])
        guard.add_resource([user, group, website])
        guard.grant(group, view, website)
        guard.grant(user,  edit, website)
        if guard.has_permission(user, view, website):
        print 'Permission granted.'
        
        Spiff Guard's features include recursion, groups, Python type awareness,
        inverse lookup, and a lot more. For a more complete example, have a look
        into the `README file`_ included with the package. You may also look at the
        `API documentation`_.
