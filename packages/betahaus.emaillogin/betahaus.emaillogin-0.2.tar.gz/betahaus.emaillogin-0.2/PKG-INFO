Description: betahaus.emaillogin
        ====================
        
        
        What is betahaus.emaillogin?
        ----------------------------
        The use of emailaddress are speading more and more but Plone does not
        have a convenient way to use a users registered email address to login.
        
        ``betahaus.emaillogin`` makes it possible to login using the email address
        specified in the user profile.
        
        Plone has a very powerful and modifiable authentication system called
        Pluggable Authentication Service (PAS). As the name suggest the system
        is pluggable and thus can easily be extended by third-party products
        such as this.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        buildout:
        - add ``betahaus.emaillogin`` entries to eggs and zcml in the appropriate buildout configuration file.
        - re-run buildout.
        - Install via portal_quickinstaller or Site Setup in plone
        
        
        `buildout.eggnest <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/buildout.eggnest/>`_:
        - copy this `eggnest file <http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/betahaus.emaillogin/buildout/src/betahaus.emaillogin.nestegg>`_ to your eggnest directory
        - re-run buildout
        - Install via portal_quickinstaller or Site Setup in plone
        
        
        How it works
        ------------
        
        ``betahaus.emaillogin`` is at installation put first in the list of
        extraction plugins. If an email address is specified and a corresponding
        user is found. The email address in the request is replaced with the
        username and then simulates failed extraction to continue normal login procedure.

        A quick word about buildout.eggnest
        -----------------------------------
        
        `buildout.eggnest <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/buildout.eggnest/>`_ is an extension to buildout that enables you to auto load eggs.
        You only drop a .nestegg specification file into a predefined directory and it will get downloaded
        by buildout as if it was entered in the buildout configuration file.
        This way you don't have to edit the buildout config all the time.
        The .nestegg specification file is normally made by the author of the egg.
