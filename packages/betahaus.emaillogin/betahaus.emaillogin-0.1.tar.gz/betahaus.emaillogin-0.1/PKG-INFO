        ====================
        
        
        What is betahaus.emaillogin?
        ----------------------------
        The use of emailaddress are speading more and more but Plone does not
        have a convenient way to use a users registered email address to login.
        
        ``betahaus.emaillogin`` makes it possible to login using the email address
        specified in the user profile.
        
        Plone has a very powerful and modifiable authentication system called
        Pluggable Authentication Service (PAS). As the name suggest the system
        is pluggable and thus can easily be extended by third-party products
        such as this.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        buildout:
        - add ``betahaus.emaillogin`` entries to eggs and zcml in the appropriate buildout configuration file.
        - re-run buildout.
        - Install via portal_quickinstaller or Site Setup in plone
        
        
        `buildout.eggnest <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/buildout.eggnest/>`_:
        - copy this `eggnest file <http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/betahaus.emaillogin/buildout/src/betahaus.emaillogin.nestegg>`_ to your eggnest directory
        - re-run buildout
        - Install via portal_quickinstaller or Site Setup in plone
        
        
        How it works
        ------------
        
        ``betahaus.emaillogin`` is at installation put first in the list of
        extraction plugins. If an email address is specified and a corresponding
        user is found. The email address in the request is replaced with the
        username and then simulates failed extraction to continue normal login procedure.
