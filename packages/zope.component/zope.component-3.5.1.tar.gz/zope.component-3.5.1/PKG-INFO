        Releases
        ********
        
        3.6.0 (unreleased)
        ==================
        
        ...
        
        3.5.1 (2008-07-25)
        ==================
        
        Fix bug introduced in 3.5.0: <utility factory="..."> no longer supported
        interfaces declared in Python and always wanted an explicit provides="..."
        attribute. https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/251865
        
        3.5.0 (2008-07-25)
        ==================
        
        Support registration of utilities via factories through the component registry
        and return factory information in the registration information. This fixes
        https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/240631
        
        Optimized un/registerUtility via storing an optimized data structure for
        efficient retrieval of already registered utilities. This avoids looping over
        all utilities when registering a new one.
        
        3.4.0 (2007-09-29)
        ==================
        
        No further changes since 3.4.0a1.
        
        3.4.0a1 (2007-04-22)
        ====================
        
        Corresponds to zope.component from Zope 3.4.0a1.
        
        In the Zope 3.3.x series, ``zope.component`` was simplified yet once
        more.  See http://wiki.zope.org/zope3/LocalComponentManagementSimplification
        for the proposal describing the changes.
        
        3.2.0.2 (2006/04/15)
        ====================
        
        Fix packaging bug:  'package_dir' must be a *relative* path.
        
        zope.component version 3.2.0.1 (2006/04/14)
        ----------------------------------------------
        
        Packaging change:  suppress inclusion of 'setup.cfg' in 'sdist' builds.
        
        3.2.0 (2006/01/05)
        ==================
        
        Corresponds to the verison of the zope.component package shipped as part of
        the Zope 3.2.0 release.
        
        Deprecated services and related APIs. The adapter and utility registries
        are now available directly via the site manager's 'adapters' and 'utilities'
        attributes, respectively.  Services are accessible, but deprecated, and
        will be removed in Zope 3.3.
        
        Deprectaed all presentation-related APIs, including all view-related
        API functions. Use the adapter API functions instead.
        See http://dev.zope.org/Zope3/ImplementViewsAsAdapters`
        
        Deprecated 'contextdependent' package:  site managers are now looked up
        via a thread global, set during URL traversal.  The 'context' argument
        is now always optional, and should no longer be passed.
        
        3.0.0 (2004/11/07)
        ==================
        
        Corresponds to the verison of the zope.component package shipped as part of
        the Zope X3.0.0 release.

        Zope Component Architecture
        ===========================
        
        This package, together with `zope.interface`, provides facilities for
        defining, registering and looking up components.  There are two basic
        kinds of components: adapters and utilities.
        
        Utilities
        ---------
        
        Utilities are just components that provide an interface and that are
        looked up by an interface and a name.  Let's look at a trivial utility
        definition:
        
        >>> from zope import interface
        
        >>> class IGreeter(interface.Interface):
        ...     def greet():
        ...         "say hello"
        
        >>> class Greeter:
        ...     interface.implements(IGreeter)
        ...
        ...     def __init__(self, other="world"):
        ...         self.other = other
        ...
        ...     def greet(self):
        ...         print "Hello", self.other
        
        We can register an instance this class using `provideUtility` [1]_:
        
        >>> from zope import component
        >>> greet = Greeter('bob')
        >>> component.provideUtility(greet, IGreeter, 'robert')
        
        In this example we registered the utility as providing the `IGreeter`
        interface with a name of 'bob'. We can look the interface up with
        either `queryUtility` or `getUtility`:
        
        >>> component.queryUtility(IGreeter, 'robert').greet()
        Hello bob
        
        >>> component.getUtility(IGreeter, 'robert').greet()
        Hello bob
        
        `queryUtility` and `getUtility` differ in how failed lookups are handled:
        
        >>> component.queryUtility(IGreeter, 'ted')
        >>> component.queryUtility(IGreeter, 'ted', 42)
        42
        >>> component.getUtility(IGreeter, 'ted')
        ... # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ComponentLookupError: (<InterfaceClass ...IGreeter>, 'ted')
        
        If a component provides only one interface, as in the example above,
        then we can omit the provided interface from the call to `provideUtility`:
        
        >>> ted = Greeter('ted')
        >>> component.provideUtility(ted, name='ted')
        >>> component.queryUtility(IGreeter, 'ted').greet()
        Hello ted
        
        The name defaults to an empty string:
        
        >>> world = Greeter()
        >>> component.provideUtility(world)
        >>> component.queryUtility(IGreeter).greet()
        Hello world
        
        Adapters
        --------
        
        Adapters are components that are computed from other components to
        adapt them to some interface.  Because they are computed from other
        objects, they are provided as factories, usually classes.  Here, we'll
        create a greeter for persons, so we can provide personalized greetings
        for different people:
        
        >>> class IPerson(interface.Interface):
        ...     name = interface.Attribute("Name")
        
        >>> class PersonGreeter:
        ...
        ...     component.adapts(IPerson)
        ...     interface.implements(IGreeter)
        ...
        ...     def __init__(self, person):
        ...         self.person = person
        ...
        ...     def greet(self):
        ...         print "Hello", self.person.name
        
        The class defines a constructor that takes an argument for every
        object adapted.
        
        We used `component.adapts` to declare what we adapt.  We can find
        out if an object declares that it adapts anything using adaptedBy:
        
        >>> list(component.adaptedBy(PersonGreeter)) == [IPerson]
        True
        
        If an object makes no declaration, then None is returned:
        
        >>> component.adaptedBy(Greeter()) is None
        True
        
        
        If we declare the interfaces adapted and if we provide only one
        interface, as in the example above, then we can provide the adapter
        very simply [1]_:
        
        >>> component.provideAdapter(PersonGreeter)
        
        For adapters that adapt a single interface to a single interface
        without a name, we can get the adapter by simply calling the
        interface:
        
        >>> class Person:
        ...     interface.implements(IPerson)
        ...
        ...     def __init__(self, name):
        ...         self.name = name
        
        >>> IGreeter(Person("Sally")).greet()
        Hello Sally
        
        We can also provide arguments to be very specific about what
        how to register the adapter.
        
        >>> class BobPersonGreeter(PersonGreeter):
        ...     name = 'Bob'
        ...     def greet(self):
        ...         print "Hello", self.person.name, "my name is", self.name
        
        >>> component.provideAdapter(
        ...                        BobPersonGreeter, [IPerson], IGreeter, 'bob')
        
        The arguments can also be provided as keyword arguments:
        
        >>> class TedPersonGreeter(BobPersonGreeter):
        ...     name = "Ted"
        
        >>> component.provideAdapter(
        ...     factory=TedPersonGreeter, adapts=[IPerson],
        ...     provides=IGreeter, name='ted')
        
        For named adapters, use `queryAdapter`, or `getAdapter`:
        
        >>> component.queryAdapter(Person("Sally"), IGreeter, 'bob').greet()
        Hello Sally my name is Bob
        
        >>> component.getAdapter(Person("Sally"), IGreeter, 'ted').greet()
        Hello Sally my name is Ted
        
        If an adapter can't be found, `queryAdapter` returns a default value
        and `getAdapter` raises an error:
        
        >>> component.queryAdapter(Person("Sally"), IGreeter, 'frank')
        >>> component.queryAdapter(Person("Sally"), IGreeter, 'frank', 42)
        42
        >>> component.getAdapter(Person("Sally"), IGreeter, 'frank')
        ... # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ComponentLookupError: (...Person...>, <...IGreeter>, 'frank')
        
        Adapters can adapt multiple objects:
        
        >>> class TwoPersonGreeter:
        ...
        ...     component.adapts(IPerson, IPerson)
        ...     interface.implements(IGreeter)
        ...
        ...     def __init__(self, person, greeter):
        ...         self.person = person
        ...         self.greeter = greeter
        ...
        ...     def greet(self):
        ...         print "Hello", self.person.name
        ...         print "my name is", self.greeter.name
        
        >>> component.provideAdapter(TwoPersonGreeter)
        
        To look up a multi-adapter, use either `queryMultiAdapter` or
        `getMultiAdapter`:
        
        >>> component.queryMultiAdapter((Person("Sally"), Person("Bob")),
        ...                                  IGreeter).greet()
        Hello Sally
        my name is Bob
        
        Adapters need not be classes.  Any callable will do.  We use the
        adapter decorator (in the Python 2.4 decorator sense) to declare that
        a callable object adapts some interfaces (or classes):
        
        >>> class IJob(interface.Interface):
        ...     "A job"
        
        >>> class Job:
        ...     interface.implements(IJob)
        
        >>> def personJob(person):
        ...     return getattr(person, 'job', None)
        >>> personJob = interface.implementer(IJob)(personJob)
        >>> personJob = component.adapter(IPerson)(personJob)
        
        In Python 2.4, the example can be written:
        
        >>> @interface.implementer(IJob)
        ... @component.adapter(IPerson)
        ... def personJob(person):
        ...     return getattr(person, 'job', None)
        
        which looks a bit nicer.
        
        In this example, the personJob function simply returns the person's
        `job` attribute if present, or None if it's not present.  An adapter
        factory can return None to indicate that adaptation wasn't possible.
        Let's register this adapter and try it out:
        
        >>> component.provideAdapter(personJob)
        >>> sally = Person("Sally")
        >>> IJob(sally) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        TypeError: ('Could not adapt', ...
        
        The adaptation failed because sally didn't have a job.  Let's give her
        one:
        
        >>> job = Job()
        >>> sally.job = job
        >>> IJob(sally) is job
        True
        
        Subscription Adapters
        *********************
        
        Unlike regular adapters, subscription adapters are used when we want
        all of the adapters that adapt an object to a particular adapter.
        
        Consider a validation problem.  We have objects and we want to assess
        whether they meet some sort of standards.  We define a validation
        interface:
        
        >>> class IValidate(interface.Interface):
        ...     def validate(ob):
        ...         """Determine whether the object is valid
        ...
        ...         Return a string describing a validation problem.
        ...         An empty string is returned to indicate that the
        ...         object is valid.
        ...         """
        
        Perhaps we have documents:
        
        >>> class IDocument(interface.Interface):
        ...     summary = interface.Attribute("Document summary")
        ...     body = interface.Attribute("Document text")
        
        >>> class Document:
        ...     interface.implements(IDocument)
        ...     def __init__(self, summary, body):
        ...         self.summary, self.body = summary, body
        
        Now, we may want to specify various validation rules for
        documents. For example, we might require that the summary be a single
        line:
        
        >>> class SingleLineSummary:
        ...     component.adapts(IDocument)
        ...     interface.implements(IValidate)
        ...
        ...     def __init__(self, doc):
        ...         self.doc = doc
        ...
        ...     def validate(self):
        ...         if '\n' in self.doc.summary:
        ...             return 'Summary should only have one line'
        ...         else:
        ...             return ''
        
        Or we might require the body to be at least 1000 characters in length:
        
        >>> class AdequateLength:
        ...     component.adapts(IDocument)
        ...     interface.implements(IValidate)
        ...
        ...     def __init__(self, doc):
        ...         self.doc = doc
        ...
        ...     def validate(self):
        ...         if len(self.doc.body) < 1000:
        ...             return 'too short'
        ...         else:
        ...             return ''
        
        We can register these as subscription adapters [1]_:
        
        >>> component.provideSubscriptionAdapter(SingleLineSummary)
        >>> component.provideSubscriptionAdapter(AdequateLength)
        
        We can then use the subscribers to validate objects:
        
        >>> doc = Document("A\nDocument", "blah")
        >>> [adapter.validate()
        ...  for adapter in component.subscribers([doc], IValidate)
        ...  if adapter.validate()]
        ['Summary should only have one line', 'too short']
        
        >>> doc = Document("A\nDocument", "blah" * 1000)
        >>> [adapter.validate()
        ...  for adapter in component.subscribers([doc], IValidate)
        ...  if adapter.validate()]
        ['Summary should only have one line']
        
        >>> doc = Document("A Document", "blah")
        >>> [adapter.validate()
        ...  for adapter in component.subscribers([doc], IValidate)
        ...  if adapter.validate()]
        ['too short']
        
        Handlers
        ********
        
        Handlers are subscription adapter factories that don't produce
        anything.  They do all of their work when called.  Handlers
        are typically used to handle events.
        
        Event subscribers are different from other subscription adapters in
        that the caller of event subscribers doesn't expect to interact with
        them in any direct way.  For example, an event publisher doesn't
        expect to get any return value.  Because subscribers don't need to
        provide an API to their callers, it is more natural to define them
        with functions, rather than classes.  For example, in a
        document-management system, we might want to record creation times for
        documents:
        
        >>> import datetime
        
        >>> def documentCreated(event):
        ...     event.doc.created = datetime.datetime.utcnow()
        
        In this example, we have a function that takes an event and performs
        some processing.  It doesn't actually return anything.  This is a
        special case of a subscription adapter that adapts an event to
        nothing.  All of the work is done when the adapter "factory" is
        called.  We call subscribers that don't actually create anything
        "handlers".  There are special APIs for registering and calling
        them.
        
        To register the subscriber above, we define a document-created event:
        
        >>> class IDocumentCreated(interface.Interface):
        ...     doc = interface.Attribute("The document that was created")
        
        >>> class DocumentCreated:
        ...     interface.implements(IDocumentCreated)
        ...
        ...     def __init__(self, doc):
        ...         self.doc = doc
        
        We'll also change our handler definition to:
        
        >>> def documentCreated(event):
        ...     event.doc.created = datetime.datetime.utcnow()
        
        >>> documentCreated = component.adapter(IDocumentCreated)(documentCreated)
        
        Note that in Python 2.4, this can be written:
        
        >>> @component.adapter(IDocumentCreated)
        ... def documentCreated(event):
        ...     event.doc.created = datetime.datetime.utcnow()
        
        This marks the handler as an adapter of `IDocumentCreated` events.
        
        Now we'll register the handler  [1]_:
        
        >>> component.provideHandler(documentCreated)
        
        Now, if we can create an event and use the `handle` function to call
        handlers registered for the event:
        
        >>> component.handle(DocumentCreated(doc))
        >>> doc.created.__class__.__name__
        'datetime'
        
        
        
        .. [1] CAUTION: This API should only be used from test or
        application-setup code. This API shouldn't be used by regular
        library modules, as component registration is a configuration
        activity.
        
        Events
        ======
        
        The Component Architecture provides a way to dispatch events to event
        handlers.  Event handlers are registered as *subscribers*
        a.k.a. *handlers*.
        
        Before we can start we need to import ``zope.component.event`` to make
        the dispatching effective:
        
        >>> import zope.component.event
        
        Consider two event classes:
        
        >>> class Event1(object):
        ...     pass
        
        >>> class Event2(Event1):
        ...     pass
        
        Now consider two handlers for these event classes:
        
        >>> called = []
        
        >>> import zope.component
        >>> @zope.component.adapter(Event1)
        ... def handler1(event):
        ...     called.append(1)
        
        >>> @zope.component.adapter(Event2)
        ... def handler2(event):
        ...     called.append(2)
        
        We can register them with the Component Architecture:
        
        >>> zope.component.provideHandler(handler1)
        >>> zope.component.provideHandler(handler2)
        
        Now let's go through the events.  We'll see that the handlers have been
        called accordingly:
        
        >>> from zope.event import notify
        >>> notify(Event1())
        >>> called
        [1]
        
        >>> del called[:]
        >>> notify(Event2())
        >>> called.sort()
        >>> called
        [1, 2]
        
        
        
        Object events
        -------------
        
        
        The ``objectEventNotify`` function is a subscriber to dispatch
        ObjectEvents to interested adapters.
        
        First create an object class:
        
        >>> class IUseless(zope.interface.Interface):
        ...     """Useless object"""
        
        >>> class UselessObject(object):
        ...     """Useless object"""
        ...     zope.interface.implements(IUseless)
        
        Then create an event class:
        
        >>> class IObjectThrownEvent(zope.component.interfaces.IObjectEvent):
        ...     """An object has been thrown away"""
        
        >>> class ObjectThrownEvent(zope.component.interfaces.ObjectEvent):
        ...     """An object has been thrown away"""
        ...     zope.interface.implements(IObjectThrownEvent)
        
        Create an object and an event:
        
        >>> hammer = UselessObject()
        >>> event = ObjectThrownEvent(hammer)
        
        Then notify the event to the subscribers.
        Since the subscribers list is empty, nothing happens.
        
        >>> zope.component.event.objectEventNotify(event)
        
        Now create an handler for the event:
        
        >>> events = []
        >>> def record(*args):
        ...     events.append(args)
        
        >>> zope.component.provideHandler(record, [IUseless, IObjectThrownEvent])
        
        The event is notified to the subscriber:
        
        >>> zope.component.event.objectEventNotify(event)
        >>> events == [(hammer, event)]
        True
        
        Following test demonstrates how a subscriber can raise an exception
        to prevent an action.
        
        >>> zope.component.provideHandler(zope.component.event.objectEventNotify)
        
        Let's create a container:
        
        >>> class ToolBox(dict):
        ...     def __delitem__(self, key):
        ...         notify(ObjectThrownEvent(self[key]))
        ...         return super(ToolBox,self).__delitem__(key)
        
        >>> container = ToolBox()
        
        And put the object into the container:
        
        >>> container['Red Hammer'] = hammer
        
        Create an handler function that will raise an error when called:
        
        >>> class Veto(Exception):
        ...     pass
        
        >>> def callback(item, event):
        ...     assert(item == event.object)
        ...     raise Veto
        
        Register the handler:
        
        >>> zope.component.provideHandler(callback, [IUseless, IObjectThrownEvent])
        
        Then if we try to remove the object, an ObjectThrownEvent is fired:
        
        >>> del container['Red Hammer']
        ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        raise Veto
        Veto
        
        Component-Management objects
        ============================
        
        Component-management objects provide a higher-level
        component-management API over the basic adapter-registration API
        provided by the zope.interface package.  In particular, it provides:
        
        - utilities
        
        - support for computing adapters, rather than just looking up adapter
        factories.
        
        - management of registration comments
        
        The zope.component.registry.Components class provides an
        implementation of zope.component.interfaces.IComponents that provides
        these features.
        
        >>> from zope.component import registry
        >>> from zope.component import tests
        >>> components = registry.Components('comps')
        
        As components are registered, events are generated.  Let's register
        an event subscriber, so we can see the events generated:
        
        >>> import zope.event
        >>> def logevent(event):
        ...     print event
        >>> zope.event.subscribers.append(logevent)
        
        Utilities
        ---------
        
        You can register Utilities using registerUtility:
        
        >>> components.registerUtility(tests.U1(1))
        Registered event:
        UtilityRegistration(<Components comps>, I1, u'', 1, None, u'')
        
        Here we didn't specify an interface or name.  An unnamed utility was
        registered for interface I1, since that is only interface implemented
        by the U1 class:
        
        >>> components.getUtility(tests.I1)
        U1(1)
        
        You can also register a utility using a factory instead of a utility instance:
        
        >>> def factory():
        ...    return tests.U1(1)
        >>> components.registerUtility(factory=factory)
        Registered event:
        UtilityRegistration(<Components comps>, I1, u'', 1, <function factory at <SOME ADDRESS>>, u'')
        
        
        If a component implements other than one interface or no interface,
        then an error will be raised:
        
        >>> components.registerUtility(tests.U12(2))
        ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        TypeError: The utility doesn't provide a single interface and
        no provided interface was specified.
        
        >>> components.registerUtility(tests.A)
        ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        TypeError: The utility doesn't provide a single interface and
        no provided interface was specified.
        
        
        We can provide an interface if desired:
        
        >>> components.registerUtility(tests.U12(2), tests.I2)
        Registered event:
        UtilityRegistration(<Components comps>, I2, u'', 2, None, u'')
        
        and we can specify a name:
        
        >>> components.registerUtility(tests.U12(3), tests.I2, u'three')
        Registered event:
        UtilityRegistration(<Components comps>, I2, u'three', 3, None, u'')
        
        >>> components.getUtility(tests.I2)
        U12(2)
        
        >>> components.getUtility(tests.I2, 'three')
        U12(3)
        
        If you try to get a utility that doesn't exist, you'll get a component
        lookup error:
        
        >>> components.getUtility(tests.I3)
        ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ComponentLookupError:
        (<InterfaceClass zope.component.tests.I3>, u'')
        
        Unless you use queryUtility:
        
        >>> components.queryUtility(tests.I3)
        >>> components.queryUtility(tests.I3, default=42)
        42
        
        You can get information about registered utilities with the
        registeredUtilities method:
        
        >>> for registration in sorted(components.registeredUtilities()):
        ...     print registration.provided, registration.name
        ...     print registration.component, registration.info
        <InterfaceClass zope.component.tests.I1>
        U1(1)
        <InterfaceClass zope.component.tests.I2>
        U12(2)
        <InterfaceClass zope.component.tests.I2> three
        U12(3)
        
        Duplicate registrations replace existing ones:
        
        >>> components.registerUtility(tests.U1(4), info=u'use 4 now')
        Registered event:
        UtilityRegistration(<Components comps>, I1, u'', 4, None, u'use 4 now')
        >>> components.getUtility(tests.I1)
        U1(4)
        
        >>> for registration in sorted(components.registeredUtilities()):
        ...     print registration.provided, registration.name
        ...     print registration.component, registration.info
        <InterfaceClass zope.component.tests.I1>
        U1(4) use 4 now
        <InterfaceClass zope.component.tests.I2>
        U12(2)
        <InterfaceClass zope.component.tests.I2> three
        U12(3)
        
        As shown in the this example, you can provide an "info" argumemnt when
        registering utilities.  This provides extra documentation about the
        registration itself that is shown when listing registrations.
        
        You can also unregister utilities:
        
        >>> components.unregisterUtility(provided=tests.I1)
        Unregistered event:
        UtilityRegistration(<Components comps>, I1, u'', 4, None, u'use 4 now')
        True
        
        A boolean is returned indicating whether anything changed:
        
        >>> components.queryUtility(tests.I1)
        >>> for registration in sorted(components.registeredUtilities()):
        ...     print registration.provided, registration.name
        ...     print registration.component, registration.info
        <InterfaceClass zope.component.tests.I2>
        U12(2)
        <InterfaceClass zope.component.tests.I2> three
        U12(3)
        
        When you unregister, you can specify a component.  If the component
        doesn't match the one registered, then nothing happens:
        
        >>> u5 = tests.U1(5)
        >>> components.registerUtility(u5)
        Registered event:
        UtilityRegistration(<Components comps>, I1, u'', 5, None, u'')
        >>> components.unregisterUtility(tests.U1(6))
        False
        >>> components.queryUtility(tests.I1)
        U1(5)
        >>> components.unregisterUtility(u5)
        Unregistered event:
        UtilityRegistration(<Components comps>, I1, u'', 5, None, u'')
        True
        >>> components.queryUtility(tests.I1)
        
        You can get the name and utility for all of the utilities that provide
        an interface using getUtilitiesFor:
        
        >>> sorted(components.getUtilitiesFor(tests.I2))
        [(u'', U12(2)), (u'three', U12(3))]
        
        getAllUtilitiesRegisteredFor is similar to getUtilitiesFor except that
        it includes utilities that are overridden.  For example, we'll
        register a utility that for an extending interface of I2:
        
        >>> util = tests.U('ext')
        >>> components.registerUtility(util, tests.I2e)
        Registered event:
        UtilityRegistration(<Components comps>, I2e, u'', ext, None, u'')
        
        We don't get the new utility for getUtilitiesFor:
        
        >>> sorted(components.getUtilitiesFor(tests.I2))
        [(u'', U12(2)), (u'three', U12(3))]
        
        but we do get it from getAllUtilitiesRegisteredFor:
        
        >>> sorted(map(str, components.getAllUtilitiesRegisteredFor(tests.I2)))
        ['U(ext)', 'U12(2)', 'U12(3)']
        
        Removing a utility also makes it disappear from getUtilitiesFor:
        
        >>> components.unregisterUtility(util, tests.I2e)
        Unregistered event:
        UtilityRegistration(<Components comps>, I2e, u'', ext, None, u'')
        True
        >>> list(components.getAllUtilitiesRegisteredFor(tests.I2e))
        []
        
        Adapters
        --------
        
        You can register adapters with registerAdapter:
        
        >>> components.registerAdapter(tests.A12_1)
        Registered event:
        AdapterRegistration(<Components comps>, [I1, I2], IA1, u'', A12_1, u'')
        
        Here, we didn't specify required interfaces, a provided interface, or
        a name.  The required interfaces were determined from the factory
        s __component_adapts__ attribute and the provided interface was
        determined by introspecting what the factory implements.
        
        >>> components.getMultiAdapter((tests.U1(6), tests.U12(7)), tests.IA1)
        A12_1(U1(6), U12(7))
        
        If a factory implements more than one interface, an exception will be
        raised:
        
        >>> components.registerAdapter(tests.A1_12)
        ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        TypeError: The adapter factory doesn't implement a single
        interface and no provided interface was specified.
        
        Unless the provided interface is specified:
        
        >>> components.registerAdapter(tests.A1_12, provided=tests.IA2)
        Registered event:
        AdapterRegistration(<Components comps>, [I1], IA2, u'', A1_12, u'')
        
        If a factory doesn't declare an implemented interface, an exception will be
        raised:
        
        >>> components.registerAdapter(tests.A12_)
        ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        TypeError: The adapter factory doesn't implement a single
        interface and no provided interface was specified.
        
        Unless the provided interface is specified:
        
        >>> components.registerAdapter(tests.A12_, provided=tests.IA2)
        Registered event:
        AdapterRegistration(<Components comps>, [I1, I2], IA2, u'', A12_, u'')
        
        The required interface needs to be specified in the registration if
        the factory doesn't have a __component_adapts__ attribute:
        
        >>> components.registerAdapter(tests.A_2)
        ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        TypeError: The adapter factory doesn't have a __component_adapts__
        attribute and no required specifications were specified
        
        Unless the required specifications specified:
        
        >>> components.registerAdapter(tests.A_2, required=[tests.I3])
        Registered event:
        AdapterRegistration(<Components comps>, [I3], IA2, u'', A_2, u'')
        
        Classes can be specified in place of specifications, in which case the
        implementedBy specification for the class is used:
        
        >>> components.registerAdapter(tests.A_3, required=[tests.U],
        ...                            info="Really class specific")
        ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        Registered event:
        AdapterRegistration(<Components comps>, [zope.component.tests.U], IA3, u'',
        A_3, 'Really class specific')
        
        We can see the adapters that have been registered using the
        registeredAdapters method:
        
        >>> for registration in sorted(components.registeredAdapters()):
        ...     print registration.required
        ...     print registration.provided, registration.name
        ...     print registration.factory, registration.info
        ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        (<InterfaceClass zope.component.tests.I1>,
        <InterfaceClass zope.component.tests.I2>)
        <InterfaceClass zope.component.tests.IA1>
        zope.component.tests.A12_1
        (<InterfaceClass zope.component.tests.I1>,
        <InterfaceClass zope.component.tests.I2>)
        <InterfaceClass zope.component.tests.IA2>
        zope.component.tests.A12_
        (<InterfaceClass zope.component.tests.I1>,)
        <InterfaceClass zope.component.tests.IA2>
        zope.component.tests.A1_12
        (<InterfaceClass zope.component.tests.I3>,)
        <InterfaceClass zope.component.tests.IA2>
        zope.component.tests.A_2
        (<implementedBy zope.component.tests.U>,)
        <InterfaceClass zope.component.tests.IA3>
        zope.component.tests.A_3 Really class specific
        
        As with utilities, we can provide registration information when
        registering adapters.
        
        If you try to fetch an adapter that isn't registered, you'll get a
        component-lookup error:
        
        >>> components.getMultiAdapter((tests.U(8), ), tests.IA1)
        ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ComponentLookupError: ((U(8),),
        <InterfaceClass zope.component.tests.IA1>, u'')
        
        unless you use queryAdapter:
        
        >>> components.queryMultiAdapter((tests.U(8), ), tests.IA1)
        >>> components.queryMultiAdapter((tests.U(8), ), tests.IA1, default=42)
        42
        
        When looking up an adapter for a single object, you can use the
        slightly simpler getAdapter and queryAdapter calls:
        
        >>> components.getAdapter(tests.U1(9), tests.IA2)
        A1_12(U1(9))
        
        >>> components.queryAdapter(tests.U1(9), tests.IA2)
        A1_12(U1(9))
        
        >>> components.getAdapter(tests.U(8), tests.IA1)
        ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        Traceback (most recent call last):

        You can unregister an adapter.  If a factory is provided and if the

        If a factory implements more than one interface, an exception will be

        >>> components.unregisterAdapter(tests.A12_1, required=[tests.U])
        False
        
        The factory can be omitted, to unregister *any* factory that matches
        specified required and provided interfaces:
        
        >>> components.unregisterAdapter(required=[tests.U], provided=tests.IA3)

        True
        
        >>> for registration in sorted(components.registeredAdapters()):
        ...     print registration
        
        Adapters can be named:
        
        >>> components.registerAdapter(tests.A1_12, provided=tests.IA2,
        ...                            name=u'test')

        A1_12(U1(9))
        
        It is possible to look up all of the adapters that provide an
        interface:
        
        >>> components.registerAdapter(tests.A1_23, provided=tests.IA2,
        ...                            name=u'test 2')
        Registered event:
        AdapterRegistration(<Components comps>, [I1], IA2, u'test 2', A1_23, u'')

        >>> for name, adapter in sorted(components.getAdapters((tests.U1(9), ),
        ...                                                    tests.IA2)):

        getAdapters is most commonly used as the basis of menu systems.
        
        If an adapter factory returns None, it is equivalent to there being no
        factory:
        
        >>> components.registerAdapter(tests.noop,

        Subscribers
        -----------
        
        Subscribers provide a way to get multiple adapters of a given type.
        In this regard, subscribers are like named adapters, except that there
        isn't any concept of the most specific adapter for a given name.
        
        Subscribers are registered by calling registerSubscriptionAdapter:
        
        >>> components.registerSubscriptionAdapter(tests.A1_2)
        ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        Registered event:
        SubscriptionRegistration(<Components comps>, [I1], IA2, u'', A1_2, u'')
        
        >>> components.registerSubscriptionAdapter(
        ...     tests.A1_12, provided=tests.IA2)
        ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        Registered event:
        SubscriptionRegistration(<Components comps>, [I1], IA2, u'', A1_12, u'')
        
        >>> components.registerSubscriptionAdapter(
        ...     tests.A, [tests.I1], tests.IA2,
        ...     info='a sample comment')
        ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        Registered event:
        SubscriptionRegistration(<Components comps>, [I1], IA2, u'',
        A, 'a sample comment')
        
        The same rules, with regard to when required and provided interfaces
        have to be specified apply as with adapters:
        
        >>> components.registerSubscriptionAdapter(tests.A1_12)
        ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        TypeError: The adapter factory doesn't implement a single
        interface and no provided interface was specified.
        
        >>> components.registerSubscriptionAdapter(tests.A)
        ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        TypeError: The adapter factory doesn't implement a single interface and
        no provided interface was specified.
        
        >>> components.registerSubscriptionAdapter(tests.A, required=[tests.IA1])
        ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        TypeError: The adapter factory doesn't implement a single interface
        and no provided interface was specified.
        
        Note that we provided the info argument as a keyword argument above.
        That's because there is a name argument that's reserved for future
        use. We can give a name, as long as it is an empty string:
        
        >>> components.registerSubscriptionAdapter(
        ...     tests.A, [tests.I1], tests.IA2, u'', 'a sample comment')
        ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        Registered event:
        SubscriptionRegistration(<Components comps>, [I1], IA2, u'',
        A, 'a sample comment')
        
        >>> components.registerSubscriptionAdapter(
        ...     tests.A, [tests.I1], tests.IA2, u'oops', 'a sample comment')
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        TypeError: Named subscribers are not yet supported
        
        Subscribers are looked up using the subscribers method:
        
        >>> for s in components.subscribers((tests.U1(1), ), tests.IA2):
        ...    print s
        A1_2(U1(1))
        A1_12(U1(1))
        A(U1(1),)
        A(U1(1),)
        
        Note that, because we created multiple subscriptions for A, we got multiple
        subscriber instances.
        
        As with normal adapters, if a factory returns None, the result is skipped:
        
        >>> components.registerSubscriptionAdapter(
        ...     tests.noop, [tests.I1], tests.IA2)
        Registered event:
        SubscriptionRegistration(<Components comps>, [I1], IA2, u'', noop, u'')
        
        >>> for s in components.subscribers((tests.U1(1), ), tests.IA2):
        ...    print s
        A1_2(U1(1))
        A1_12(U1(1))
        A(U1(1),)
        A(U1(1),)
        
        We can get registration information for subscriptions:
        
        >>> for registration in sorted(
        ...     components.registeredSubscriptionAdapters()):
        ...     print registration.required
        ...     print registration.provided, registration.name
        ...     print registration.factory, registration.info
        (<InterfaceClass zope.component.tests.I1>,)
        <InterfaceClass zope.component.tests.IA2>
        zope.component.tests.A a sample comment
        (<InterfaceClass zope.component.tests.I1>,)
        <InterfaceClass zope.component.tests.IA2>
        zope.component.tests.A a sample comment
        (<InterfaceClass zope.component.tests.I1>,)

        <InterfaceClass zope.component.tests.IA2>
        <function noop at 0xb796ff7c>
        
        We can also unregister subscriptions in much the same way we can for adapters:
        
        >>> components.unregisterSubscriptionAdapter(tests.A1_2)
        ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        Unregistered event:
        SubscriptionRegistration(<Components comps>, [I1], IA2, u'', A1_2, '')
        True
        
        >>> for s in components.subscribers((tests.U1(1), ), tests.IA2):
        ...    print s
        A1_12(U1(1))

        A(U1(1),)

        True
        
        >>> for s in components.subscribers((tests.U1(1), ), tests.IA2):

        Note here that both registrations for A were removed.
        
        If we omit the factory, we must specify the required and provided interfaces:
        
        >>> components.unregisterSubscriptionAdapter(required=[tests.I1])
        Traceback (most recent call last):

        >>> for registration in sorted(
        ...     components.registeredSubscriptionAdapters()):
        ...     print registration.factory
        
        As when registering, an error is raised if the registration
        information can't be determined from the factory and isn't specified:

        If you unregister something that's not registered, nothing will be
        changed and False will be returned:
        
        
        >>> components.unregisterSubscriptionAdapter(

        Handlers
        --------
        
        Handlers are used when you want to perform some function in response
        to an event.  Handlers aren't expected to return anything when called
        and are not registered to provide any interface.
        
        >>> from zope import component
        >>> @component.adapter(tests.I1)
        ... def handle1(x):
        ...     print 'handle1', x
        
        >>> components.registerHandler(handle1, info="First handler")
        ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        Registered event:
        HandlerRegistration(<Components comps>, [I1], u'',
        handle1, 'First handler')
        >>> components.handle(tests.U1(1))
        handle1 U1(1)
        
        >>> @component.adapter(tests.I1, tests.I2)
        ... def handle12(x, y):
        ...     print 'handle12', x, y
        
        >>> components.registerHandler(handle12)
        Registered event:
        HandlerRegistration(<Components comps>, [I1, I2], u'', handle12, u'')
        >>> components.handle(tests.U1(1), tests.U12(2))
        handle12 U1(1) U12(2)
        
        If a handler doesn't document interfaces it handles, then
        the required interfaces must be specified:
        
        >>> def handle(*objects):
        ...     print 'handle', objects
        
        >>> components.registerHandler(handle)
        ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        TypeError: The adapter factory doesn't have a __component_adapts__
        attribute and no required specifications were specified
        
        >>> components.registerHandler(handle, required=[tests.I1],
        ...                            info="a comment")
        Registered event:
        HandlerRegistration(<Components comps>, [I1], u'', handle, 'a comment')
        
        Handlers can also be registered for classes:
        
        >>> components.registerHandler(handle, required=[tests.U],
        ...                            info="handle a class")
        ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        Registered event:
        HandlerRegistration(<Components comps>, [zope.component.tests.U], u'',
        handle, 'handle a class')
        
        
        >>> components.handle(tests.U1(1))
        handle (U1(1),)
        handle1 U1(1)
        handle (U1(1),)
        
        We can list the handler registrations:
        
        >>> for registration in components.registeredHandlers():
        ...     print registration.required
        ...     print registration.handler, registration.info
        ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        (<InterfaceClass zope.component.tests.I1>,)
        <function handle1 at 0xb78f5bfc> First handler
        (<InterfaceClass zope.component.tests.I1>,

        <function handle12 at 0xb78f5c34>
        (<InterfaceClass zope.component.tests.I1>,)
        <function handle at 0xb78f5ca4> a comment
        (<implementedBy zope.component.tests.U>,)
        <function handle at 0xb78f5ca4> handle a class
        
        and we can unregister handlers:
        
        >>> components.unregisterHandler(required=[tests.U])
        ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        Unregistered event:
        HandlerRegistration(<Components comps>, [zope.component.tests.U], u'',
        None, '')
        True
        
        >>> for registration in components.registeredHandlers():
        ...     print registration.required
        ...     print registration.handler, registration.info
        ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        (<InterfaceClass zope.component.tests.I1>,)
        <function handle1 at 0xb78f5bfc> First handler

        <function handle12 at 0xb78f5c34>
        (<InterfaceClass zope.component.tests.I1>,)
        <function handle at 0xb78f5ca4> a comment
        
        >>> components.unregisterHandler(handle12)
        Unregistered event:
        HandlerRegistration(<Components comps>, [I1, I2], u'', handle12, '')
        True
        
        >>> for registration in components.registeredHandlers():
        ...     print registration.required
        ...     print registration.handler, registration.info
        (<InterfaceClass zope.component.tests.I1>,)

        False
        
        >>> components.unregisterHandler()
        Traceback (most recent call last):

        Extending
        ---------
        
        Component-management objects can extend other component-management
        objects.
        
        >>> c1 = registry.Components('1')
        >>> c1.__bases__
        ()
        
        >>> c2 = registry.Components('2', (c1, ))
        >>> c2.__bases__ == (c1, )
        True
        
        >>> c1.registerUtility(tests.U1(1))
        Registered event:
        UtilityRegistration(<Components 1>, I1, u'', 1, None, u'')
        
        >>> c1.queryUtility(tests.I1)
        U1(1)
        >>> c2.queryUtility(tests.I1)
        U1(1)
        >>> c1.registerUtility(tests.U1(2))
        Registered event:
        UtilityRegistration(<Components 1>, I1, u'', 2, None, u'')
        
        >>> c2.queryUtility(tests.I1)
        U1(2)
        
        We can use multiple inheritence:
        
        >>> c3 = registry.Components('3', (c1, ))
        >>> c4 = registry.Components('4', (c2, c3))
        >>> c4.queryUtility(tests.I1)
        U1(2)
        
        >>> c1.registerUtility(tests.U12(1), tests.I2)
        Registered event:
        UtilityRegistration(<Components 1>, I2, u'', 1, None, u'')
        
        >>> c4.queryUtility(tests.I2)
        U12(1)
        
        >>> c3.registerUtility(tests.U12(3), tests.I2)
        Registered event:
        UtilityRegistration(<Components 3>, I2, u'', 3, None, u'')
        >>> c4.queryUtility(tests.I2)
        U12(3)
        
        >>> c1.registerHandler(handle1, info="First handler")
        Registered event:
        HandlerRegistration(<Components 1>, [I1], u'', handle1, 'First handler')
        
        >>> c2.registerHandler(handle, required=[tests.U])
        ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        Registered event:
        HandlerRegistration(<Components 2>, [zope.component.tests.U], u'',
        handle, u'')
        
        >>> @component.adapter(tests.I1)
        ... def handle3(x):
        ...     print 'handle3', x
        >>> c3.registerHandler(handle3)
        Registered event:
        HandlerRegistration(<Components 3>, [I1], u'', handle3, u'')
        
        >>> @component.adapter(tests.I1)
        ... def handle4(x):
        ...     print 'handle4', x
        >>> c4.registerHandler(handle4)
        Registered event:
        HandlerRegistration(<Components 4>, [I1], u'', handle4, u'')
        
        >>> c4.handle(tests.U1(1))
        handle1 U1(1)
        handle3 U1(1)
        handle (U1(1),)
        handle4 U1(1)
        
        Redispatch of registration events
        ---------------------------------
        
        Some handlers are available that, if registered, redispatch
        registration events to the objects being registered.  They depend on
        being dispatched to by the object-event dispatcher:
        
        >>> from zope import component
        >>> import zope.component.event
        >>> zope.component.getGlobalSiteManager().registerHandler(
        ...      zope.component.event.objectEventNotify)
        ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        Registered event:
        HandlerRegistration(<BaseGlobalComponents base>,
        [IObjectEvent], u'', objectEventNotify, u'')
        
        To see this, we'll first register a multi-handler to show is when
        handlers are called on 2 objects:
        
        >>> @zope.component.adapter(None, None)
        ... def double_handler(o1, o2):
        ...     print 'Double dispatch:'
        ...     print ' ', o1
        ...     print ' ', o2
        >>> zope.component.getGlobalSiteManager().registerHandler(double_handler)
        ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        Double dispatch:
        HandlerRegistration(<BaseGlobalComponents base>,
        [Interface, Interface], u'', double_handler, u'')
        Registered event:
        HandlerRegistration(<BaseGlobalComponents base>,
        [Interface, Interface], u'', double_handler, u'')
        Registered event:
        HandlerRegistration(<BaseGlobalComponents base>,
        [Interface, Interface], u'', double_handler, u'')
        
        In the example above, the double_handler reported it's own registration. :)
        
        Now we'll register our handlers:
        
        >>> zope.component.getGlobalSiteManager().registerHandler(
        ...     registry.dispatchUtilityRegistrationEvent)
        ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE +ELLIPSIS
        Double dispatch:
        ...
        
        >>> zope.component.getGlobalSiteManager().registerHandler(
        ...     registry.dispatchAdapterRegistrationEvent)
        ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE +ELLIPSIS
        Double dispatch:
        ...
        
        >>> zope.component.getGlobalSiteManager().registerHandler(
        ...     registry.dispatchSubscriptionAdapterRegistrationEvent)
        ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE +ELLIPSIS
        Double dispatch:
        ...
        
        >>> zope.component.getGlobalSiteManager().registerHandler(
        ...     registry.dispatchHandlerRegistrationEvent)
        ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        Double dispatch:
        HandlerRegistration(<BaseGlobalComponents base>,
        [IHandlerRegistration, IRegistrationEvent], u'',
        dispatchHandlerRegistrationEvent, u'')
        Registered event:
        HandlerRegistration(<BaseGlobalComponents base>,
        [IHandlerRegistration, IRegistrationEvent], u'',
        dispatchHandlerRegistrationEvent, u'')
        Double dispatch:
        <function dispatchHandlerRegistrationEvent at 0xb799f72c>
        Registered event:
        HandlerRegistration(<BaseGlobalComponents base>,
        [IHandlerRegistration, IRegistrationEvent], u'',
        dispatchHandlerRegistrationEvent, u'')
        Registered event:
        HandlerRegistration(<BaseGlobalComponents base>,
        [IHandlerRegistration, IRegistrationEvent], u'',
        dispatchHandlerRegistrationEvent, u'')
        
        In the last example above, we can see that the registration of
        dispatchHandlerRegistrationEvent was handled by
        dispatchHandlerRegistrationEvent and redispatched.  This can be seen
        in the second double-dispatch output, where the first argument is the
        object being registered, which is dispatchHandlerRegistrationEvent.
        
        If we change some other registrations, we can the double dispatch
        taking place:
        
        >>> components.registerUtility(u5)
        ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        Double dispatch:
        UtilityRegistration(<Components comps>, I1, u'', 5, None, u'')
        Registered event:
        UtilityRegistration(<Components comps>, I1, u'', 5, None, u'')
        Double dispatch:
        U1(5)
        Registered event:
        UtilityRegistration(<Components comps>, I1, u'', 5, None, u'')
        Registered event:
        UtilityRegistration(<Components comps>, I1, u'', 5, None, u'')
        
        >>> components.registerAdapter(tests.A12_1)
        ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        Double dispatch:
        AdapterRegistration(<Components comps>, [I1, I2], IA1, u'', A12_1, u'')
        Registered event:
        AdapterRegistration(<Components comps>, [I1, I2], IA1, u'', A12_1, u'')
        Double dispatch:
        zope.component.tests.A12_1
        Registered event:
        AdapterRegistration(<Components comps>, [I1, I2], IA1, u'', A12_1, u'')
        Registered event:
        AdapterRegistration(<Components comps>, [I1, I2], IA1, u'', A12_1, u'')
        
        >>> components.registerSubscriptionAdapter(tests.A1_2)
        ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        Double dispatch:
        SubscriptionRegistration(<Components comps>, [I1], IA2, u'', A1_2, u'')
        Registered event:
        SubscriptionRegistration(<Components comps>, [I1], IA2, u'', A1_2, u'')
        Double dispatch:
        zope.component.tests.A1_2
        Registered event:
        SubscriptionRegistration(<Components comps>, [I1], IA2, u'', A1_2, u'')
        Registered event:
        SubscriptionRegistration(<Components comps>, [I1], IA2, u'', A1_2, u'')
