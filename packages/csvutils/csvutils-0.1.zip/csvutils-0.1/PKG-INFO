Description: The standard csv module is very useful for parsing tabular data in CSV format.
        Typically though, one or more transformations need to be applied to the generated
        rows before being ready to be used; for instance "convert the 3rd column to int,
        the 5th to float and ignore all the rest". This module provides an easy way to
        specify such transformations upfront instead of coding them every time by hand.
        
        Two classes are currently available, SequenceTransformer and MappingTransformer,
        that represent each row as a list (like csv.reader) or dict (like csv.DictReader),
        respectively.
