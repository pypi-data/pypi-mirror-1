<h1>RunSnakeRun<br>
</h1>
<p class="introduction">RunSnakeRun is a small GUI utility that allows
you to view (Python) HotShot, cProfile or Profile profiler dumps in a sortable GUI view.&nbsp; It
loads hotshot dumps incrementally in the background so that you can begin
viewing the profile results fairly quickly.<br>
</p>
<h2><a name="install"></a>Installation<br>
</h2>
<p>If you already have Python setuptools installed (a.k.a. <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall">easy_install</a>), you should be able to install with:</p><pre>easy_install RunSnakeRun<br>easy_install numpy<br>easy_install wxPython</pre><p>As shown, you will require a modern <a href="http://www.wxpython.org/">wxPython</a>
and Python installation with <a href="http://numpy.scipy.org/">Numpy/Numeric</a>
installed. &nbsp;We don't automatically install these with
easy_install, as that can cause problems for those who have manually
installed the packages or who are behind corporate firewalls.</p><p>You can manually <a href="#download">download the package</a> and run:</p>
<pre>python setup.py install</pre>
<p>to install the package. &nbsp;This will setup a script named "runsnake" on Linux machines which launches the profiler.</p>
<h2><a name="usage"></a>Usage</h2>
<p>To record a hotshot profile of your application:</p>
<pre>import hotshot<br>profiler = hotshot.Profile( "test.profile", lineevents=0 )<br>command = '''reactor.run()''' # your mainloop call here, this is for a Twisted app...<br>profiler.runctx( command, globals(), locals())<br>profiler.close()</pre>
<p>Or, to use cProfile:</p><pre>import cProfile<br>command = """reactor.run()"""<br>cProfile.runctx( command, globals(), locals(), filename="OpenGLContext.profile" )</pre><p>To view the results of your run:<br>
</p>
<pre>python ../runsnakerun/runsnake.py test.profile<br></pre>
<p>There will be a brief delay as the application is created and begins
the loading process, then you should see something like this:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 810px; height: 428px;" alt="Screenshot of the application viewing a HotShot profile" src="screenshot.png"><br>
</p>
<p>Click on the column titles to sort by that property.&nbsp; As the
loading proceeds the screen will refresh/flash to show the new
data.&nbsp; Very large data-sets can take quite a long time to complete
loading.</p><h2><a name="code"></a>Code Access and Contributions</h2><p>RunSnakeRun
is reasonably stable. &nbsp;I don't tend to do much work on it, as it
tends to just work. &nbsp;If you have a bug, feature or idea, feel free
to check out the code and implement the new feature. &nbsp;I'm willing
to entertain new features or bug-fix requests as well. &nbsp;The code
is available in bzr here:</p><pre>bzr branch http://www.vrplumber.com/bzr/runsnakerun/<br>cd runsnakerun<br>python setup.py develop<br></pre><p>You can <a href="mailto:mcfletch@vrplumber.com">contact me directly</a> if you'd like to contribute (if there is interest we can move development to LaunchPad at some point).</p>
<h2><a name="download"></a>Releases/Downloads</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="RunSnakeRun-1.0.4.tar.gz">1.0.4</a> -- Add
preliminary support for standard cProfile/profile profile results, note
that we do not load cProfile results incrementally. &nbsp;Switch to
numpy support from Numeric. &nbsp;Use setuptools for distribution.
&nbsp;Provide source repository access.</li><li><a href="RunSnakeRun-1.0.3.tar.gz">1.0.3</a> -- Fix stupid bug
introduced by last fix</li>
  <li><a href="RunSnakeRun-1.0.2.tar.gz">1.0.2</a> -- Magically grow
the stack-tracking structures if we pass recursion limits, this will be
slow, but it should allow for loading even extremely stack-exhausting
programs</li>
  <li><a href="RunSnakeRun-1.0.1.tar.gz">1.0.1</a> -- Bug-fix,
increases stack-tracking size to 10x recursion limit, instead of ==
recursion limit, but as of yet, doesn't seem to fix the reported
stack-exhaustion</li>
  <li><a href="RunSnakeRun-1.0.0.tar.gz">1.0.0</a> -- Initial release,
no fancy features, just the raw functionality</li>
</ul>
