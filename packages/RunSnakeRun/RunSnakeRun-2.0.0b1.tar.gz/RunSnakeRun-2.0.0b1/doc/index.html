<h1>RunSnakeRun<br>
</h1>
<p class="introduction">RunSnakeRun is a small GUI utility that allows
you to view (Python) cProfile or Profile profiler dumps in a sortable
GUI view. &nbsp;It allows you to explore the profiler information using
a "square map" visualization or sortable tables of data.<br>
</p>
<h2>Features</h2><p>RunSnakeRun is a simple program, it doesn't provide
all the bells-and-whistles of a program like KCacheGrind, it's intended
to allow for profiling your Python programs, and just your Python
programs. &nbsp;What it does provide:</p><ul><li>sortable data-grid views for raw profile information</li><ul><li>identity: function name, file-name, directory name</li><li>time-spent: cummulative, cummulative-per, local and local-per time</li></ul><ul><li>overall data-grid view</li><li>(all) callers-of-this-function, (all) callees-of-this-function views</li></ul><li>squaremap view of call tree</li><ul><li>size proportional to amount of time spent by the given parent in the given function</li></ul><li>squaremap view of packages/modules/functions</li><ul><li>size proportional to time spent in each package/module/function</li></ul><li>basic navigation (home, back, up)</li></ul><h2><a name="install"></a>Installation<br>
</h2>
<p>If you already have Python setuptools installed (a.k.a. <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall">easy_install</a>), you should be able to install with:</p><pre>easy_install RunSnakeRun<br>easy_install wxPython</pre><p>As shown, you will require a modern <a href="http://www.wxpython.org/">wxPython</a>
and Python installation. &nbsp;We don't automatically install this with
easy_install, as that can cause problems for those who have manually
installed the packages or who are behind corporate firewalls.</p><p>You can manually <a href="#download">download the package</a> and run:</p>
<pre>python setup.py install</pre>
<p>to install the package. &nbsp;This will setup a script named "runsnake" on Linux machines which launches the profiler.</p>
<h2><a name="usage"></a>Usage</h2><p>To use cProfile to capture your application's profile data:</p><pre>import cProfile<br>command = """reactor.run()"""<br>cProfile.runctx( command, globals(), locals(), filename="OpenGLContext.profile" )</pre><p>To view the results of your run:<br>
</p>
<pre>python runsnake.py OpenGLContext.profile<br></pre>
<p>There will be a brief delay as the application is created and begins
the loading process, then you should see something like this:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 1113px; height: 872px;" alt="Screenshot of the application viewing a HotShot profile" src="screenshot-2.0.png"><br>
</p>
<p>Click on any column title to sort by that property within that list.
&nbsp;Select a record in the left-most list view to see a breakdown of
that record in the right-side list views. &nbsp;Choose the appropriate
view on the right via the tabs. &nbsp;You can resize the borders
between the lists and square-map views. &nbsp;You can select a
package/module/function hierarchic view via the menus. &nbsp;You can
also toggle use of percentage displays there.</p><h2><a name="code"></a>Code Access and Contributions</h2><p>RunSnakeRun
is reasonably stable. &nbsp;I don't tend to do much work on it, as it
tends to just work. &nbsp;My current wish list for the project follows:</p><ul><li>allow
for loading-and-comparing two runs in a data-grid side-by-side with the
equal functions next to each other (blanks for functions that don't
exist in both runs)</li></ul><p>If you have an idea, feel free
to check out the code and&nbsp;implement the new&nbsp;feature. &nbsp;I'm certainly willing
to entertain new features or bug-fix requests as well. &nbsp;The code
is available in bzr here:</p><pre>bzr branch lp:~mcfletch/squaremap/trunk squaremap<br>bzr branch lp:~mcfletch/runsnakerun/trunk runsnakerun<br>cd runsnakerun<br>python setup.py develop<br></pre><p>You can <a href="mailto:mcfletch@vrplumber.com">contact me directly</a> if you'd like to contribute.</p>
<h2><a name="download"></a>Releases/Downloads</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2.0.0a1 -- Eliminate support for (obsolete) Hotshot
profiles, add squaremap visualization and callee/caller views, lots of
UI work to make the application more usable, preliminary i18n work
(just gettext markup)</li><li><a href="RunSnakeRun-1.0.4.tar.gz">1.0.4</a> -- Add
preliminary support for standard cProfile/profile profile results, note
that we do not load cProfile results incrementally. &nbsp;Switch to
numpy support from Numeric. &nbsp;Use setuptools for distribution.
&nbsp;Provide source repository access.</li><li><a href="RunSnakeRun-1.0.3.tar.gz">1.0.3</a> -- Fix stupid bug
introduced by last fix</li>
  <li><a href="RunSnakeRun-1.0.2.tar.gz">1.0.2</a> -- Magically grow
the stack-tracking structures if we pass recursion limits, this will be
slow, but it should allow for loading even extremely stack-exhausting
programs</li>
  <li><a href="RunSnakeRun-1.0.1.tar.gz">1.0.1</a> -- Bug-fix,
increases stack-tracking size to 10x recursion limit, instead of ==
recursion limit, but as of yet, doesn't seem to fix the reported
stack-exhaustion</li>
  <li><a href="RunSnakeRun-1.0.0.tar.gz">1.0.0</a> -- Initial release,
no fancy features, just the raw functionality</li>
</ul>
