Description: Changelog for collective.emaillogin
        ===================================
        
        
        0.4 (2009-05-05)
        ----------------

        0.3 (2009-05-05)
        ----------------
        
        - Removed personalize_form.cpt(.metadata) as there was no important
        difference with the one from default Plone.  [maurits+mike]
        
        - Take over a small change in default Plone to the personalize.cpy.
        
        - Fixed join form to also work in newer Plones by using the
        @@authenticator provider for protecting this join form.  Keeps
        working in Plone 3.0 as well (which does not use plone.protect).

        0.2 (2009-05-05)
        ----------------
        
        - No longer register our own skin path (skin selection), but just add
        our emaillogin skin layer to the existing skin selections.
