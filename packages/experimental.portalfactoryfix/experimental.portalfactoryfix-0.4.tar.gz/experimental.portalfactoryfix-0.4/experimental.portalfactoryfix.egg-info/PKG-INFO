Description: Overview
        ========
        
        Experimental performance improvements to content creation for Plone. Primarily
        this works by trying to ensure that portal factory does not cause writes to the
        zodb, via making archetypes content portal factory aware such that they do not
        attempt to register themselves in various global catalogs.
