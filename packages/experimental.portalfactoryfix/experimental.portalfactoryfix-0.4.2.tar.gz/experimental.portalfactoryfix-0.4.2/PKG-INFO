Description: Overview
        ========
        
        Experimental performance improvements to content creation for Plone. Primarily
        this works by trying to ensure that portal factory does not cause writes to the
        zodb, via making archetypes content portal factory aware such that they do not
        attempt to register themselves in various global catalogs.  Previously portal
        factory would manually unindex the content after the request, but that would still
        cause writes to global data structures, creating write conflict hotspots and zodb
        bloat for what should be a stateless operation.
        
        This issue is being tracked by Plone at the following URL.
