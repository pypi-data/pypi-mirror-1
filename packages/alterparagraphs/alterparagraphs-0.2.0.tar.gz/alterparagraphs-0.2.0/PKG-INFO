Description: `Alterparagraphs` is an ongoing effort for providing a family of
        paragraph implementations, each to be used as a replacement for the
        regular and only paragraph flowable inside the ReportLab package.
        
        The idea behind this collection of paragraphs is to provide simple
        implementations that can be more easily understood and extended than
        the monolithic paragraph implementation as implemented by ReportLab.
        
        Note that many of the paragraph classes in `alterparagraphs` are not
        finished in the sense that they are directly ready for production
        (this is especially true for the XMLParagraph, the development of
        which has barely started). You must test yourself if they are suitable
        for your purpose. In any case it should be much easier to tweak them
        to make them do what you need compared to the standard ReportLab
        implementation.
