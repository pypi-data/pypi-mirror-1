Description: A runtime type-checking module for Python supporting both parameter-type checking and return-type checking for funcitons, methods and generators.
        
        The main workhorses of this module, the functions typecheck_args and typecheck_return, are used as function/method decorators. A typecheck_yield decorator provides a mechanism to typecheck the values yielded by generators.
        
        Three utility classes, And(), Or() and Not() are provided to assist in building more complex signatures by creating boolean expressions based on classes and/or types.
        
        A number of other utility classes exist to aid in type signature creation:
        Any() - you don't care about the type
        IsIterable() - the object can be used in `for` statements, for example
        IsCallable() - the object can be invoked
        HasAttr() - the object has certain attributes; types may also be specified
        
        The module also includes support for type variables, a concept borrowed from languages such as Haskell.
