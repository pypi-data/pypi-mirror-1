Description: 
        Kamaelia is an open source project from BBC R&D. It makes prototyping
        multimedia, network & broadcast aware systems simple. Kamaelia systems are
        naturally concurrent and transform into production quality, maintainable
        systems, with relatively little change from prototype.
        
        It is useful for things from 3D systems through building PVRs through video
        playback, through shot change detection, through P2P distribution (live and
        bit torrent), through whiteboards, handwriting/gesture recognition, speech
        generation, and games systems, and back through DVB on both the reception
        side and broadcast side, and lots more not mentioned...
