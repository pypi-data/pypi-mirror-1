<h1> Kamaelia Documentation </h1>

<P> In Kamaelia you build systems from simple components that talk to each
other. What sort of systems? Network servers, clients, desktop applications,
pygame based games, transcode systems and pipelines, digital TV systems,
spam eradicators, teaching tools, and a fair amount more :)

<P> In order to do this, Kamaelia is divided into two main namespaces:
<ul>

<li> <a href="Axon/Axon.html">Axon</a> - this provides the core component &
     concurrency framework. You use to build components which communicate
     with one another.

<li> <a href="Kamaelia/Kamaelia.html">Kamaelia</a> - this is the collection
     of components that exist. The vast majority of these come from systems
     created for a variety of purposes. This namespace is in itself further
     subdivided into two halves:
   <ul>
      <li> Kamaelia.Apps - this is where components from some Kamaelia based
           applications reside. The purpose behind this is to provide an
           experimental staging ground for new components to migrate into
           the main Kamaelia namespace. This also means you can use
           components from other Kamaelia applications sooner rather than
           later. As a result, these components may be lacking in two main
           areas - documentation or generality, but putting them here allows
           for components to migrate to a more generally useful state.

   <li> Kamaelia.{anything else} - this is where components will migrate to
        when we are happy with the fact they are sufficiently general and
        useful outside their original application.

   </ul>
