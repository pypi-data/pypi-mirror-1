Change history
==============

0.4 (2008-04-27)
----------------

- Made sure the configure.zcml is added to package includes if a meta.zcml or
  overrides.zcml in the same packages have already been found.
  [hannosch]


0.3 (2008-04-27)
----------------

- Use a new line as a separator for added entries. A space makes buildout
  think it has to deal with a version specifier.

0.2 (2008-04-27)
----------------

- Added support for automatically finding multiple instances.
  [hannosch]

- Better use the recipe name for finding the instance, as this is less likely
  to conflict.
  [hannosch]
