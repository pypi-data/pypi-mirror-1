Change history
==============

0.6 (2008-10-29)
----------------

- fixed install problem on windows: 
  http://plone.org/support/forums#nabble-f293351

- split buildout configuration values before we test if an egg was
  added already. using 'in' with a string doen't work if an egg's
  name is a substring of an already added egg (e.g. plone.app.content 
  after plone.app.contentmenu).

- sort output of os.listdir (it's order is undefined) to make
  debugging easier.

0.4 (2008-04-27)

- Made sure the configure.zcml is added to package includes if a meta.zcml or
  overrides.zcml in the same packages have already been found.

0.3 (2008-04-27)
----------------

- Use a new line as a separator for added entries. A space makes buildout
  think it has to deal with a version specifier.

0.2 (2008-04-27)
----------------

- Added support for automatically finding multiple instances.
  [hannosch]

- Better use the recipe name for finding the instance, as this is less likely
  to conflict.
  [hannosch]

----------------

  [hannosch]
