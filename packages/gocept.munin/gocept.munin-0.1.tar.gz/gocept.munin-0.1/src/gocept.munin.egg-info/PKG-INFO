        Utilities for writing munin client scripts
        ==========================================
        
        This package provides base classes for defining Munin graphs and a main
        function to handle munin-typical symlinked scripts.
        
        Munin plugin scripts
        ====================
        
        A single plugin file defines (multiple) graphs by subclassing the bases as mentioned in
        the next section. The main function uses the called script's filename  to
        determine which of the defined graphs is relevant.
        
        Data for each graph is determined by retrieving a text file from a URL (with
        possibly given basic authentication data).
        
        The format for the data is plain/text wich each line having key/value pairs
        split by ':'. The values are expected to be floats.
        
        All graph bases expect two environment variables to be set:
        
        URL
        The URL at which to retrieve data from. Must include a '%s' which encodes
        the graph name.
        AUTH
        HTTP basic authentication information. Either empty or in the form of
        'username:password'.
        
        The environment variables can be configured using munin's `plugin-conf.d` like
        this:
        
        The plugin is called `prefix_something_1`::
        
        [prefix_*]
        env.URL http://foo:8900/myapp/munin?data=%s
        env.AUTH admin:admin
        
        Graph bases
        ===========
        
        The following base classes are currently defined:
        
        SimpleGraph
        A simple graph with a single value that is plotted as an absolute value.
        
        SimpleMultiGraph
        Multiple absolute values plotted on the same graph and scale.
        
        more bases will be added as needed.
        
        Main function
        =============
        
        The main function handles munin-typical `type_option_index` symlink scripts by
        looking at the name from which the main script was called.
        
        Example script
        ==============
        
        Here's a sample script that you could symlink into the `plugins` directory::
        
        from gocept.munin.client import SimpleGraph, main
        
        class people(SimpleGraph):
        name = key = 'people'
        title = 'How many people are there?'
        category = 'Office'
        
        main()
