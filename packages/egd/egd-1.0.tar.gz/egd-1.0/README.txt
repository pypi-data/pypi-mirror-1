'egd' is a Python language module for obtaining random data from an
EGD (entropy gathering daemon) source; primarily for use on Unix-like
operating systems that do not have a /dev/random device.

To install, type:

   python setup.py install

or optionally just copy the file "egd.py" to whereever you want.
See INSTALL.txt for mo detailed instructions.


The module is self-documented, so within the python interpreter type:

   import egd
   help(egd)

or from a command line:

   pydoc egd
