Description: 
        This is a very minimal API into Kontagent, written using purely modules from
        the Python standard library.
        
        Here's how you might use it:
        
        from kontagent import Kontagent
        
        k = Kontagent('MY_API_KEY', 'MY_SECRET_KEY')
        k.invite_sent(16904779, [542469672], tracking_tag='testtag')
        
        This is now being used in production for http://radiosox.com/
        
        A full list of all of the methods available is:
        
        * invite_sent
        * invite_click_response
        * notification_sent
        * notification_click_response
        * notification_email_sent
        * notification_email_response
        * post
        * post_response
        * application_added
        * application_removed
        * undirected_communication_click
        * page_request
        * user_information
        * goal_counts
        * revenue_tracking
        * raw_request
        
        You should consult with the Kontagent REST Server API to see what each of these
        functions does.  You can find that here:
        
        http://developers.kontagent.com/reference/api-documentation/facebook-rest-server-api
        
        Unfortunately, for right now you're going to have to UTSL to find out about the
        parameters that each method takes.
        
        Hope you find this useful!
