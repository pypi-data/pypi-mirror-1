Description: ======
        Tailer
        ======
        Python tail is a simple implementation of GNU tail and head.
        
        It provides 3 main functions that can be performed on any file-like object that
        supports seek() and tell().
        
        * tail - read lines from the end of a file
        * head - read lines from the top of a file
        * follow - read lines as a file grows
        
        It also comes with pytail, a command line version offering the same
        functionality as GNU tail. This can be particularly useful on Windows systems
        that have no tail equivalent.
