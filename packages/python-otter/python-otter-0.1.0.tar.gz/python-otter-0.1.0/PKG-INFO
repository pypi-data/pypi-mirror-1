Description: Otter API is a RESTful HTTP web service to Topsy.
        Topsy is a search engine that ranks URLs by the number and quality of tweets
        they receive. The quality of tweets is determined by the influence of the
        Twitter users (referred to as authors) - which is based on their position in
        the retweet network. URLs that are mentioned by important authors are ranked
        higher.
        
        The Otter API provides access to topsy search results, url information and
        author information along with the intermediate data (like author influence)
        that is used in creation of search rankings. http://topsy.com/ has been
        created using the Otter API, and almost everything available on the site is
        accessible to developers.
