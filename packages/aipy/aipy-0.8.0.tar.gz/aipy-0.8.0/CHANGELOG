0.8.0
* Added resolving support for elliptical sources in resolve_src() in ant.py.  
* Reworked how get_baseline() and gen_uvw() functioned to facilitate elliptical
  sources.  This change required updating scripts that use gen_uvw().
* Allowed specifying coordinate epochs for RadioFixedBody's
* Changed how plot_img.py, mk_map.py work.  There is now a general script
  mk_img.py which geberates FITS files (introduced in 0.7.1) for each specified
  source, or for equally-spaced phase centers around the sphere.  This script
  is responsible for all image generation.  mk_map.py now takes these FITS
  images as input and uses them as facet images to make a spherical Healpix
  map.  plot_img.py is now a visualization tool (a la plot_uv.py and 
  plot_map.py), and overlays appropriate ra/dec grids on the FITS images.
* Flipped u/v order (and sign of v) in the Img class in img.py to be more 
  naturally compatible with FITS image conventions.  Required a change to
  Img.gen_LM() as well.

0.7.2
* Added sorting to plot_uv.py to make plots in sensible baseline order.
* Edited script documentation for plot_map.py
* Changed "-a" in scripting.py so that "-a 0,1,2" includes only baselines that
  involve these antennas without autos (i.e. 0_1,0_2,1_2), rather than all
  baselines that involve any of the antennas. Listing 1 antenna will 
  include all baselines involving that antenna.
* Fixed combine_freqs.py to work with new numpy masked arrays.
* Made fitmdl.py have a --sim_auto parameter that rejects auto-correlations
  by default.  This makes fitmdl.py work more nicely with '-a' change above.

0.7.1
* Changed "flat" to "flatten()" in plot_img.py, as per numpy-1.2.
* Made plot_map.py able to function (only for cyl projection) without basemap.
* Added FITS image I/O convenience functions to img.py.  Defined standard
  FITS format based on VLA images.  

0.7.0
* Moved functions from xrfi.py script into rfi module
* Bugfix in array shape in BeamFlat response() function
* Ported to numpy>=1.2.  Involved:
  - Update flag_by_int in rfi module for new numpy-1.2.ma behavior
  - Update miriad_wrap.cpp, healpix_wrap.cpp, alm_wrap.cpp for new 
    numpy-1.2 API (PyArray_SimpleNew instead of PyArray_FromDims, 
    npy_intp instead of int for array dimensions)

0.6.5
* Bugfix to source strength polynomials as a function of LST
* Corrected all 3C source postions in src.py using NED.
* Ported to numpy>=1.1, matplotlib>=0.98, basemap>=0.99.  Involved:
    - use of numpy.histogram with new=True in xrfi.py
    - importing Basemap from mpl_toolkits.basemap in plot_map.py
* Split dependency installation into two scripts: install_required.sh
  which installs the minimum needed to be able to install aipy and run
  "import aipy", and install_recommended.sh which installs matplotlib/basemap
  and is needed for most of the scripts that come with AIPY.

0.6.4
* Attempting to support easy_install/setuptools functionality while maintaining
  the simple building that already works.
* Feature added to plot_map.py to give (ra,dec),flux of location on a map
  when right-clicked.
* Changed how plot_map.py plots to use imshow instead of contourf.

0.6.3
* Added _cephes module (from scipy, cutting out fortran dependencies) which
  implements various scientific functions.  Needed j1 = Bessel function.
* Moved source-resolution estimator (using symmetric disc approx) from phs2src
  into separate AntennaArray.resolve_src().  Changed from incorrect sinc
  function to correct j1 (first order Bessel function).
