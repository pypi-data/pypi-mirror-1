CHANGES
=======

3.7.1 (2010-01-10)
------------------

- Fix ftesting.zcml due to the zope.securitypolicy update.

- Removed unneeded dependency on zope.app.publisher, added the missing one on
  zope.security.

- Added test dependency on zope.login.

3.7.0 (2009-02-01)
------------------

- Move core functionality to new ``zope.intid`` package, leaving only
  ZMI-related browser views here.
  
  Note, that if you used the ``exclude`` directive from ``zc.configuration``
  package to exclude the ``subscribers.zcml`` file from ``zope.app.intid``,
  you need to change the directive to exclude it from ``zope.intid`` now.

3.6.0 (2009-01-31)
------------------

- Changed dependency from ``zope.app.container`` to
  ``zope.container``.

- Move test dependencies ``zope.app.folder`` and
  ``zope.app.component`` as ``zope.site``.

3.5.1 (2008-12-11)
------------------

- Make it possible to subscribe object-specific handlers
  for IntIdAddedEvent/IntIdRemovedEvent. Use them like
  the zope.app.container.interfaces.IObjectAddedEvent.

- Include utility->id mapping of added ids to the
  IntIdAddedEvent.

- Removed testing dependencies from install_requires.

3.5.0 (2008-06-19)
------------------

- Separate subscriber configuration into a separate ZCML file.
