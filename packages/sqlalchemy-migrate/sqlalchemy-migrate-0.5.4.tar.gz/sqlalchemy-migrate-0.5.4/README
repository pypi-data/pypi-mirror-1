Tests and Bugs
--------------

To run automated tests:
- Copy test_db.cfg.tmpl to test_db.cfg
- Edit test_db.cfg with database connection strings suitable for
  running tests.  (Use empty databases.)
- python setup.py test

Note that nose [5] is required to run migrate's tests. It should be
installed automatically; if not, try "easy_install nose".
