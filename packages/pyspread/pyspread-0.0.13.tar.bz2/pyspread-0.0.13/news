pyspread file format switches to OpenDocument format (ODF) (2009-05-31)

OpenDocument format (ODF) has been chosen to replace the old pys file format.

This step became necessary, because the pys format stores only the code inside
the grid. Since cell formatting (fonts, borders, backgrounds, etc.) has been
introduced (currently in subversion, will be in 0.0.12), a new save file format
was required. Furthermore, the old pys format has always been a security issue.
Therefore, changing to a new format that is not backwards-compatible is the 
obvious choice. Note that pys file loading and saving will still be available.

OpenDocument format (ODF) has the benefit of being an accredited standard with
an open license (free of cost). It has also been adopted by a variety of 
well-known spreadsheets such as:

    * OpenOffice.org - Calc,
    * Microsoft Office - Excel (2007 with SP2 or via plugin).
    * Gnumeric and
    * KOffice.org - KSpread,

ODF integration is going to be a step-by-step approach. In a first step 
(scheduled for 0.0.12), pyspread in-cell Python code will appear as 
non-functional Python code strings in the other spreadsheets and the cell 
content in other spreadsheets will be treated as Python code. In a second 
step, the ODF data types are correctly converted into appropriate Python data 
types. Conversion of simple formulas may be realized later on. 

pyspread 0.0.11 released (2009-04-04)
A new release of pyspread has been released.

New features:

    * Recursion detection for slicing operations added
    * Dependency to networkx added
    * Command line options added
    * Command line help added
    * Unicode support added
    * Save As and Save functionality separated

Bug fixes:

    * Internal variables stop showing up in macro dialog (BUG 2407828)
    * Copy result now works on Windows (BUG 2569877)
    * Replace now updates cells properly (BUG 2569880)
    * Resize function works now (BUG 2569895)

Known issues: (updated 2009-05-31)

    * On Windows, Python 2.6 causes trouble with wxPython 2.9.8.2. Please use 
      Python 2.5
    * On Windows, some dialogs have to be closed twice.
    * Recursion detection dows not work on nested structures, i.e. when S[2,2,2]
      is referred to from inside a container object, pyspread will not realize 
      a cycle. Therefore, a "Maximum recursion depth" error is reported (fixed 
      in svn.)
