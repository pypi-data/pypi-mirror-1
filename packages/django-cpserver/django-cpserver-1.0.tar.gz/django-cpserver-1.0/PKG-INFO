        cpserver is a Django application, which is intended to solve simple, yet useful
        task: run your Django project under CherryPy webserver. It contains two
        commands:
        
        - `runcpdebug`, which outputs information about each request (in format,
        similar to Apache's `access_log`). It is useful as replacement for regular
        `runserver` command.
        - `runcpserver`, which is quite silent (it only tells you configuration after
        starting). It is useful for running as backend for Nginx or HAProxy or
        whatever you'd like to use.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        It's quite simple: put `cpserver` directory under your Python's sys.path (in
        site-packages or in your Django project tree structure) and add `'cpserver'` to
        `INSTALLED_APPS` setting.
        
        Of course, you'll need installed CherryPy 3, either whole suite or just their
        `wsgiserver` module. You can even put `wsgiserver` in `cpserver`'s directory
        (where `translogger.py` sits).

        Thanks to DjangoCerise project, from which I've taken initial code.
