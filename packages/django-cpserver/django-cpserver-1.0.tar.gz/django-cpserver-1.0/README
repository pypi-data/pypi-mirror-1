=================

cpserver is a Django application, which is intended to solve simple, yet useful
task: run your Django project under CherryPy webserver. It contains two
commands:

 - `runcpdebug`, which outputs information about each request (in format,
   similar to Apache's `access_log`). It is useful as replacement for regular
   `runserver` command.
 - `runcpserver`, which is quite silent (it only tells you configuration after
   starting). It is useful for running as backend for Nginx or HAProxy or
   whatever you'd like to use.

Installation
------------

It's quite simple: put `cpserver` directory under your Python's sys.path (in
site-packages or in your Django project tree structure) and add `'cpserver'` to
`INSTALLED_APPS` setting.

Of course, you'll need installed CherryPy 3, either whole suite or just their
`wsgiserver` module. You can even put `wsgiserver` in `cpserver`'s directory
(where `translogger.py` sits).

Thanks to DjangoCerise project, from which I've taken initial code.
