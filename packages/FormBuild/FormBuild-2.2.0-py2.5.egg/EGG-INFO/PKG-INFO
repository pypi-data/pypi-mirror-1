        2.2.0
        -----
        
        2009-10-04
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Added the ability of ``select()`` to use the new ``options`` infrastructure.
        * Updated the ``MANIFEST.in`` file to include tests and docs in the source
        distribution.
        * Moved the ``formbuild.helpers`` doctest code into the main ``doc.py`` test.
        
        2009-08-20
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Made the use of the ``default`` argument raise an Exception instead of
        logging an error
        
        2009-08-08
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Added some documentation tests
        * Changed ``checkbox_group()`` and ``radio_group()`` to take a ``sub_name``
        argument for formatting fields according to a NestedRecord structure.
        * The ``combo()`` and ``checkbox_group()`` fields can now take options from
        those passed to the ``Form`` object constructor.
        * Added Sphinx code
        * Made ``checkbox_group()`` and ``radio_group()`` XHTML compatible by using
        the attribute ``checked="checked"``.
        * Allowed the ``checkbox()`` to also be able to get its value from the
        ``options`` argument  passed to the ``Form`` constructor and determine
        whether not it is ticked from a ``True`` or ``False`` value in the ``values``
        argument passed to the ``Form`` constructor.
        
        2.1.3
        -----
        
        2009-07-13
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Used CSS for spacing of required asterix
        * Added an options argument to Form instead of individual fields having
        options
        
        2.1.2
        -----
        
        * Added a stricter ``errors_to_dict()`` function that catches errors such as
        forgetting ``allow_extra_fields``, ``filter_extra_fields``.
        * Added a values_to_dict() function for encoding values
        * Added a .validation_state attribute and ValidationState class.
        * The title() field and action bar now have a colspan of 3
        
        2.1.1
        -----
        
        * Added a title() field to the Form
        * Added an imagebutton field
        * Added field_pre and field_extra options to the field() method
        
        2.0.1
        -----
        
        * Updated the tests
        * Added a style used for padding to the labels in checkbox groups.
        * Changed _group() helper to automatically convert arguments to unicode.
        
        2.0.0
        -----
        
        * First pre-alpha version of the refactored FormBuild.
