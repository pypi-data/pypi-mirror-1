FormBuild is a package designed to help with the generation of HTML forms. It does not deal with form validation or conversion which are handled excellently by `FormEncode <http://www.formencode.org>`_ which FormBuild is desinged to complement.


Current features:

* Generation of HTML form componoents
* Ability to easily build forms in multiple pages and sections
* Separation of field and layouts
* Ability to easily change how existing forms are displayed by customising metaclasses

Status
======

FormBuild is not finished. If you fancy having a play with it the bulk of FormBuild is implemented though. It hasn't been used in production and will almost certainly have serious bugs.
