FormBuild is a package designed to help with the generation of HTML forms. It does not deal with form validation or conversion which are handled excellently by `FormEncode <http://www.formencode.org>`_ which FormBuild is desinged to complement.


Current features:

* Generation of HTML form componoents
* Ability to easily build forms in multiple pages and sections
* Separation of field and layouts
* Ability to easily change how existing forms are displayed by customising metaclasses

Documentation

* `Background and Motivation <background.html>`_
* `Getting Started Manual <manual.html>`_

Status
======

FormBuild is to be considered beta software. The APIs have not yet had widespread use so there may be one or two problems lurking or areas spotted where the APIs could be simplified further.
