Changes
=======

3.4.1 (2008-07-30)
------------------

* Substitute zope.app.zapi by direct calls to its wrapped apis.
  See http://launchpad.net/bugs/219302

* Fix deprecation warning in ftesting.zcml: ZopeSecurityPolicy now lives in
  zope.securitypolicy.

3.4.0 (2007-09-28)
------------------

* Initial release as standalone package.

* Dependency on zope.app.interpreter moved to an extra
  [inline-evaluation].  It is only needed by zope.app.pythonpage,
  which is an oddity.
