======================================
relocatable python virtual environment
======================================

package inspired a lot by ian bicking's virtualenv but created in fashion
that it can be relocated freely through the filesystem

it can by used via PYTHONPATH env variable, via site.addsitedir
or directly via {{ virtualenv }}/bin/python.py wrapper

it is based on top of lightweight-virtualenv
