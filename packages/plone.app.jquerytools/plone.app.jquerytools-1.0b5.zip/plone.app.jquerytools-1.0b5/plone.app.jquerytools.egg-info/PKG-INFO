Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        plone.app.jquerytools does two things:
        
        * It adds jQuery Tools to Plone's JavaScript resources.
        
        * It adds some helper code for loading overlays dynamically and
        for handling AJAX forms.
        
        For information on using jQuery tools, see http://flowplayer.org/tools/ .
        
        plone.app.jquerytools was developed for Plone 4. However, it can
        be used in Plone 3.x by adding a zcml slug and running it's
        GS Setup extension profile, or by adding a product like Products.pipbox
        that will load the GS profile for you.
