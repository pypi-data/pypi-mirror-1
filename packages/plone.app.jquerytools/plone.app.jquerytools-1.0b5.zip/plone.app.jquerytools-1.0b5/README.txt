Introduction
============

plone.app.jquerytools does two things:

* It adds jQuery Tools to Plone's JavaScript resources.

* It adds some helper code for loading overlays dynamically and
  for handling AJAX forms.

For information on using jQuery tools, see http://flowplayer.org/tools/ .

plone.app.jquerytools was developed for Plone 4. However, it can
be used in Plone 3.x by adding a zcml slug and running it's
GS Setup extension profile, or by adding a product like Products.pipbox
that will load the GS profile for you.
