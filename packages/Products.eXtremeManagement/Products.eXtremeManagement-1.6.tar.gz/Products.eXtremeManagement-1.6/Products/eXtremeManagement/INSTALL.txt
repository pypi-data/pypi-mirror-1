Installation
============

  Make a backup of your site.  You can never be too careful.

  Easiest is using buildout: just add Products.eXtremeManagement in
  the main eggs section.

  If you are not using buildout:

  - Put eXtremeManagement its own directory within the Products dir of
    your zope instance.

  - In the lib/python directory of your instance create a directory
    ``xm``.  Put an empty ``__init__.py`` file in that directory.
    From the cheese shop (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/) get xm.booking
    and xm.portlets.  Unpack these and arrange it so that the ``xm``
    directory has the ``booking`` directory from ``xm.booking`` and
    the ``portlets`` directory from ``xm.portlets``.

  Then use the portal_quickinstaller in Plone to install it.


Dependencies
============

  * Plone:

    - 3.0 or 3.1 with Zope 2.10

  * Poi with its dependencies.  Get a bundle with products fit for the
    Plone version you are using: http://plone.org/products/poi

    With Poi installed, eXtremeManagement allows you to add an issue
    tracker in a project.  And you can add PoiTasks to Stories, which
    lets you easily link to existing issues in the tracker of your
    project.

    We hope to be flexible enough to make integration with other issue
    trackers (e.g. trac) possible.  But the current eXtremeManagement
    developers like Poi. :)


Extras
======

  If you have a project management website you should consider
  installing the ``xm.theme`` package.  This gets rid of part of the
  default Plone UI so it fits a project management site more.  Try
  this out locally before you use it in production.


Conflicting Products
====================

  * eXtremeManagement is known not to work with ZEPP/PlonePM, another
    project management product.  It uses a Task content type, just
    like eXtremeManagement does.  This causes problems.  If you want
    to try out both, do that in separate Zope instances.

  * Same is true for PloneBooking.
