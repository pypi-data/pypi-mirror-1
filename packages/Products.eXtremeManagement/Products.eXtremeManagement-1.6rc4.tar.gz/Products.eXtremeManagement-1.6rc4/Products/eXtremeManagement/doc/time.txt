Time takes my time
==================

Stories have a rough estimate in days.  Tasks have an estimate in
hours.  Bookings have hours and minutes.  Bookings can be added to
tasks, which means that the actual hours of that task are now
increased.  Also the difference between a Task estimate and its actual
hours changes then.  This can all be very complicated and
frustrating.  So it needs good tests.  We probably want to refactor
some things here, so then tests become even more important.  And we
are starting to use events so then it is best to test things with the
zope testbrowser.

    >>> from Products.Five.testbrowser import Browser
    >>> browser = Browser()
    >>> browser.handleErrors = False
    >>> browser.addHeader('Accept-Language', 'en-US')

Let us log all exceptions, which is useful for debugging.

    >>> self.portal.error_log._ignored_exceptions = ()

Log in to the portal as the test user.

    >>> def login(username):
    ...     browser.open(self.portal.absolute_url() + '/login_form')
    ...     browser.getLink('Log in').click()
    ...     browser.getControl(name='__ac_name').value = username
    ...     browser.getControl(name='__ac_password').value = 'secret'
    ...     browser.getControl(name='submit').click()
    ...     return 'Login failed' not in browser.contents
    >>> login(self.default_user)
    True

We already have a story with rough estimate 1.5 days, which would be
roughly 12 hours.  we can use the edit form to check for some values.

    >>> browser.open(self.story.absolute_url() + '/base_edit')
    >>> browser.getControl(name='roughEstimate').value
    '1.5'
    >>> self.story.getRoughEstimate()
    1.5

We also have a task with an estimate of 5 and one half hours.

    >>> browser.open(self.task.absolute_url() + '/base_edit')
    >>> browser.getControl(name='hours').value
    '5'
    >>> browser.getControl(name='minutes').value
    ['30']
    >>> from xm.booking.timing.interfaces import IEstimate
    >>> estimate = IEstimate(self.task)
    >>> estimate.estimate
    5.5

We also want to make sure that the correct rawEstimate value is stored
in the catalog.  We have made a test function for that.

    >>> self.assertAnnotationTaskBrainEstimateEquality(self.task, 5.5)

Once a story has a task with an estimate in it, its rough estimate
mostly gets ignored in favour of the combined estimates of its tasks.

    >>> estimate = IEstimate(self.story)
    >>> estimate.estimate
    5.5

Make sure rawActualHours returns the expected value.
Also make sure the same value is stored in the catalog.
