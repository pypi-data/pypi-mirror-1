Installation
============

  Make a backup of your site.  You can never be too careful.

  Just put eXtremeManagement its own directory within the Products dir
  of your zope instance.  Then use the portal_quickinstaller or
  portal_setup (both will work) in Plone to install it.

  If you use instancemanager
  (http://plone.org/products/instance-manager), then look in the
  instancemanager directory for a config file.


Reinstalling
============

  When you reinstall, eXtremeManagement will perform automatic
  migration of previous content.  So this can take a while.  Make a
  backup of your site.  You can never be too careful.


Dependencies
============

  * Plone:

    - 2.5.3 with Zope 2.9 OR

    - 3.0 (beta) with Zope 2.10


  * Poi with its dependencies; at Zest Software we are currently (June
    2007) using the trunk bundle:

    https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/Poi/bundles/trunk

    The 10 bundle is fine as well.  On Plone 3.0 you should be using
    the plone3 Poi bundle.

    With Poi installed, eXtremeManagement allows you to add an issue
    tracker in a project.  And you can add PoiTasks to Stories, which
    lets you easily link to existing issues in the tracker of your
    project.

    We hope to be flexible enough to make integration with other issue
    trackers (e.g. trac) possible.  But the current eXtremeManagement
    developers like Poi. :)


Additional dependencies for development
=======================================

 * PloneTestCase:
   https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/PloneTestCase/trunk/ or the
   latest tar.gz (install as a product).  Make sure that all tests run
   before you check in changes.

 * Five 1.4 or higher is recommended as then you can run the
   testbrowser tests.  Zope 2.10 already comes with Five 1.5, so you
   are fine there, but Zope 2.9 only has Five 1.3.  So you need to add
   a newer version to the Products dir of your instance then.


Conflicting Products
====================

  * eXtremeManagement is known not to work with ZEPP/PlonePM, another
  project management product.  It uses a Task content type, just like
  eXtremeManagement does.  This causes problems.  If you want to try
  out both, do that in separate Zope instances.

  * Same is true for PloneBooking.
