Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        It is a CMF Tool to purge a proxy's cache. It works with both
        Squid and Enfold Enterprise Proxy. It is accessible through
        the Zope Management Interface.
        
        This product is covered by the Zope Public License.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        1. a) for Squid proxy caches
        ----------------------------
        
        Squid does not allow you to purge objects unless it is configured with access
        controls in squid.conf. First you must add something like::
        
        acl PURGE method purge
        acl localhost src 127.0.0.1
        http_access allow purge localhost
        http_access deny purge
        
        The above only allows purge requests which come from the local host and denies
        all other purge requests.
        
        Restart Squid after you did this reconfiguration.
        
        b) for Enfold Enterprise Proxy (EEP) caches
        -------------------------------------------
        
        If CMFSquidTool is running on the same machine as EEP, no extra configuration
        of EEP is necessary.
        
        If CMFSquidTool is running on a different machine, you will need to add a line
        to your EEP configuration file.  The EEP configuration file is located in the
        EEP application directory and is called 'eep.ini'.
        
        Using a text editor, add a line like this to your eep.ini file, with the IP
        addresses of the machines you wish to be able to purge the cache::
        
        remote_admin 127.0.0.1 123.45.67.89 1.2.3.4
        
        2. Zope Product
        ---------------
        
        Extract this tarball into your Zope Product folder and restart Zope when you
        did so.
        
        Afterwards install the tool into your portal by using the quickinstaller tool.
        
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        ZMI Setup
        ---------
        
        Enter the url to your portal root like it is accessable through squid, into the
        field inside the Squid Cache Urls tab of the portal_squid tool.
        
        If you have Enfold Enterprise Server, a similar interface is available from the
        Plone Control Panel.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.5 - June 19, 2008
        -------------------
        
        - Handle purge requests coming in during a transaction commit. This happens
        when collective.indexing processes its catalog queue during commit and
        CacheSetup generates purge requests for each indexed object.
        [wichert]
        
        - Use the built-in set type if available.
        [wichert]
        
        - Handle appending a URL to an empty queue correctly.
        [wichert]
        
        
        1.4.1 - May 1, 2008
        -------------------
        
        - Added an Install.py for Plone 2.5 compatibility
        [newbery]
        
        
        1.4 - April 16, 2008
        --------------------
        
        - Switch to using a GenericSetup profile for installation
        [wichert]
        
        - Repackaged as a python egg.
