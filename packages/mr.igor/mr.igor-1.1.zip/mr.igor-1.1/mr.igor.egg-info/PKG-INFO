Description: Overview
        --------
        
        mr.igor is an extension to pyflakes that will learn where you import
        things from, and then automatically fill in missing imports from the
        place they are most often imported.
        
        But how does it know?
        
        "It'th a knack."
        
        Usage: igor [--print] filename
        
        This script will record all imports from filename in Igor's database,
        and then add imports at the top of the file for any names that were not
        imported but were found in the database.
        
        If the --print option is specified then the rewritten file will be
        written to stdout. (This allows the use of igor as a filter for editors.)
        Otherwise the file will be modified inplace.
        
        Only "from x import y" style imports are tracked and inserted.  Aliases
        ("from x import y as z") are not supported.
        
        mr.igor stores its database in ~/.mr.igor.db.
        
        
        Usage with TextMate
        -------------------
        
        Go to the TextMate Bundle Editor and add a new command with the following
        settings:
        
        Save
        Current File
        Command(s)
        ::
        
        #!/bin/bash
        igor --print $TM_FILEPATH
        Input
        None
        Output
        Replace Document
        Activation
        Key Equivalent:  ⌘I
        Scope Selector
        source.python
        
        Now you can save the current file and run it through Igor using the ⌘I
        keyboard shortcut.
