RedirectionTool 1.2 - November 7, 2007

    - Updated for Plone 3 by using plone.app.redirector, replacing skin parts
      with a view + template, using GenericSetup for installation and migrate
      existing redirections on install.
      [fschulze]

    - Use new permission "RedirectionTool: Modify aliases" for the alias tab.
      [fschulze]

    - When adding an alias a security check is performed on the source path.
      This prevents users from linking to their own content from locations to
      which they normally don't have access.
