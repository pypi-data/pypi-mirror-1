        p4a.plonecalendar
        ===================
        
        TODO: Add some info here about how to install with buildout and what the dependencies are (see setup.py)
        
        Overview
        ========
        
        p4a.plonecalendar is a project which extends the p4a.calendar framework to
        run natively within a Plone environment.  It contains the extensions that
        require Plone, and the adaptions to Plone. This is mainly support for Plone
        event types and iCalendar import/export.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        1. When you're reading this you have probably already run
        ``easy_install p4a.plonecalendar``. Find out how to install setuptools
        (and EasyInstall) here:
        http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall
        
        2. Create a file called ``p4a.plonecalendar-configure.zcml`` in the
        ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
        should only contain this::
        
        <include package="p4a.plonecalendar" />
        
        
        Notes
        =====
        
        Importing an iCalendar file via http
        ------------------------------------
        
        Plone4Artists calendar can import an iCalendar file over http into a Plone
        calendar. This is useful for example if another site presents a schedule
        that you also want to present or integrate into your site.
        
        An example url for importing an icalendar file over http is::
        
        http://path/to/calendar/import_from_url?url=http://url/to/icalendarfile.ics
        
        This will open up a connection to the other site, get the icalendar file
        called "icalendarfile.ics" and import it into the folder located at
        /path/to/calendar/

        p4a.plonecalendar 1.1b1 (2008-02-20)
        ====================================
        
        New features
        ------------
        
        * Plone 3 support.
        
        * Now uses p4a.subtyper.
        
        Bugfixes
        --------
        
        * Various timezone fixes, and some minor fixes.
        
        
        p4a.plonecalendar 1.0 (2007-10-14)
        ==================================
        
        Bugfixes
        --------
        
        * Fixed issue #24 where folders created by uploading ICS files via
        webdav were not becoming calendar enhanced (Rocky Burt)
        
        * Fixed issue #41 where regular users couldn't activate their
        own folders to be calendars (Rocky Burt)
        
        p4a.plonecalendar 1.0rc1 (2007-07-31)
        =====================================
        
        Bugfixes
        --------
        
        * Many bug fixes (resulting from Boston 2007 P4A sprint)
        
        * #40 - Events not displayed in Month View on Windows IE6. Default install would not display events in IE 6.  Rob Baker supplied fix.
        
        * #39 - Timezone issue when exporting to iCal. Issue is resolved. It was an old version of DateTime.py that caused the trouble. Replacing the file with the new version (available at zope.org) solved the problem.
        
        * #38 - Time formatting for internationalization. P4A Calendar now uses the i18n library to convert the hour/minute format to the locale based on the language of the incoming browser request.  This change removed several methods on the Month class that were formally handling this formatting chore.  However, this new code does not have any tests written against it.
        
        * #36 - Event starting in the past, ending in the future is not listed. The submitter of the original bug supplied a patch. The patch was applied to the code base and tested. We concluded that the patch solves this issue.
        
        * #35 - KeyError causes month view to crash
        
        * #34 and #37 - Bug deals with a site breakage when the P4A product is removed from the file system.  This occurs after marker interfaces are set on containerish objects.  Rocky Burt concluded that this is a core Zope issue and provided a workaround is to remove all marker interfaces for P4A when uninstalling the product via the QuickInstaller.   Reinstall does not affect the marker interface settings.  The drawback is that if the product is uninstalled all site setting dealing with the calendar will be lost.   But it was considered worse to have a product that breaks a site with its removal from the files system.  The long term solution will have to come from Zope core.
        
        * #30 - Changing folder back to normal causes error.
        
        * #28 - Events with future month don't show up
