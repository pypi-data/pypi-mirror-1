Description: 
        This is a fork of the original bazaarrecipe to get it working like
        infrae.subversion. all credits to the original author
        A buildout recipe which can be used to branch a Bazaar repository.
        This makes it possible to automatically create branches for relevant
        code.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        If you have a buildout config you can add a section like:
        
        [sources]
        recipe = bazaarrecipeinfrae
        urls =
        http://bazaar-vcs.org/bzr/bzr.dev bzr.dev
        http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~bialix/heads/trunk heads
        
        This will create a `sources` folder in you buildout root with two
        subfolders in it (bzr.dev and heads).
        
        Changes to you buildout configuration might trigger removal of the
        sources dir. However, before this happens the recipe makes sure there
        are no modifications left. If it sees any it will abort before
        anything is deleted. This means you can safely use it for development.
        
        Running buildout again after you have done a succesful build before
        will do a bzr pull on each of the resources.
