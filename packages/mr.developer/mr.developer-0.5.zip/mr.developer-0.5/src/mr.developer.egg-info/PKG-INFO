Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        
        ``mr.developer`` is a ``zc.buildout`` extension which makes it easier to work with
        buildouts containing lots of packages of which you only want to develop some.
        The basic idea for this comes from Wichert Akkerman's ``plonenext`` effort.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        You add ``mr.developer`` to the ``extensions`` option of your ``[buildout]``
        section. Then you can add the following options to your ``[buildout]``
        section:
        
        ``sources-dir``
        This specifies where your development packages should be placed. Defaults
        to ``src``.
        
        ``sources-svn``
        This specifies a section which lists the subversion repository URLs of
        your packages.
        
        ``sources-git``
        This specifies a section which lists the git repository URLs of your
        packages.
        
        ``auto-checkout``
        This specifies the names of packages which should be checked out during
        buildout, packages already checked out are skipped.
        
        The following is an example of how your ``buildout.cfg`` may look like::
        
        [buildout]
        ...
        extensions = mr.developer
        sources-svn = sources-svn
        sources-git = sources-git
        auto-checkout = my.package
        
        [sources-svn]
        my.package = http://example.com/svn/my.package/trunk
        
        [sources-svn]
        some.other.package = git://example.com/git/some.other.package.git
        
        When you run buildout, you will get a script at ``bin/checkout`` in your
        buildout directory. With that script you can checkout the source from the
        specified repository, without the need to know where the repository is
        located.
        
        Now if you run buildout again, the package is automatically marked as an
        develop egg and, if it's listed in the section specified by the ``versions``
        option in the ``[buildout]`` section, the version will be set to an empty
        string, so the develop egg will actually be used.
