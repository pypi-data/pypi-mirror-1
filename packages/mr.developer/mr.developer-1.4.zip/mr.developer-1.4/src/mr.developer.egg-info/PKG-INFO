        Let Mr. Developer help you win the everlasting buildout battle!
        
        (Remixed by Matt Hamilton, original from http://xkcd.com/303)
        
        ``mr.developer`` is a ``zc.buildout`` extension which makes it easier to work with
        buildouts containing lots of packages of which you only want to develop some.
        The basic idea for this comes from Wichert Akkerman's ``plonenext`` effort.
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        You add ``mr.developer`` to the ``extensions`` option of your ``[buildout]``
        section. Then you can add the following options to your ``[buildout]``
        section:
        
        ``sources-dir``
        This specifies the default directory where your development packages will
        be placed. Defaults to ``src``.
        
        ``sources``
        This specifies the name of a section which lists the repository
        information of your packages. Defaults to ``sources``.
        
        ``auto-checkout``
        This specifies the names of packages which should be checked out during
        buildout, packages already checked out are skipped. You can use ``*`` as
        a wild card for all packages in ``sources``.
        
        The format of the section with the repository information is::
        
        <name> = <kind> <url> [path] [key=value]
        
        The different parts have the following meaning:
        
        ``<name>``
        This is the package name.
        
        ``<kind>``
        The kind of repository. Currently supported are one of ``svn``, ``hg``,
        ``git`` or ``fs``.
        
        ``<url>``
        The location of the repository. This value is specific to the version
        control system used.
        
        ``[path]``
        The (optional) base directory where the package will be checked out.
        
        The name of the package will be appended.
        
        If it's not set, then ``sources-dir`` will be used.
        
        ``[key=value]``
        You can add options with this, which are specific to the version control
        system used. There are is no whitespace allowed in `key`, `value` or
        around the equal sign.
        
        The different repository kinds accept some specific options.
        
        ``svn``
        The ``<url>`` is one of the urls supported by subversion.
        
        You can specify a url with a revision pin, like
        ``http://example.com/trunk@123``.
        
        You can also set the ``rev`` or ``revision`` option, which is either a pin
        like with ``rev=123`` or a minimum revision like ``rev=>123`` or
        ``rev=>=123``. When you set a minimum revision, the repository is updated
        when the current revision is lower.
        
        ``git``
        Currently no additional options.
        
        ``hg``
        Currently no additional options.
        
        ``fs``
        This allows you to add packages on the filesystem without a version
        control system, or with an unsupported one. You can activate and
        deactivate packages, but you don't get status info and can't update etc.
        
        The ``<url>`` needs to be the same as the ``<name>`` of the package.
        
        The following is an example of how your ``buildout.cfg`` may look like::
        
        [buildout]
        ...
        extensions = mr.developer
        sources = sources
        auto-checkout = my.package
        
        [sources]
        my.package = svn http://example.com/svn/my.package/trunk
        some.other.package = git git://example.com/git/some.other.package.git
        
        When you run buildout, you will get a script at ``bin/develop`` in your
        buildout directory. With that script you can perform various actions on the
        packages, like checking out the source code, without the need to know where
        the repository is located.
        
        For help on what the script can do, run ``bin/develop help``.
        
        If you checked out the source code of a package, you need run buildout again.
        The package will automatically be marked as an develop egg and, if it's listed
        in the section specified by the ``versions`` option in the ``[buildout]``
        section, the version will be cleared, so the develop egg will actually be
        used. You can control the list of develop eggs explicitely with the
        ``activate`` and ``deactivate`` commands of ``bin/develop``.
        
        Troubleshooting
        ===============
        
        Dirty SVN
        ---------
        
        You get an error like::
        
        ERROR: Can't switch package 'foo' from 'https://example.com/svn/foo/trunk/', because it's dirty.
        
        If you have not modified the package files under src/foo, then you can check
        what's going on with `status -v`. One common cause is a `*.egg-info` folder
        which gets generated every time you run buildout and this shows up as an
        untracked item in svn status.
        
        You should add .egg-info to your global Subversion ignores in
        `~/.subversion/config`, like this::
        
        global-ignores = *.o *.lo *.la *.al .libs *.so *.so.[0-9]* *.a *.pyc *.pyo *.rej *~ #*# .#* .*.swp .DS_Store *.egg-info
        
        HTTPS certificates
        ------------------
        
        The best way to handle https certificates at the moment, is to accept them
        permanently when checking out the source manually.
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.4 - 2009-11-16
        ----------------
        
        * Allow to set a minimal revision for ``svn`` repositories. If the current
        revision is lower, then the package is updated.
        [fschulze]
        
        1.3 - 2009-11-15
        ----------------
        
        * Read the cfg used by last buildout run. This prevents unexpected behaviour,
        if you change mr.developer options like source declarations and don't run
        buildout. Such changes are now picked up immediately.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Added tests and a buildout to run them easily.
        [fschulze]
        
        1.2 - 2009-11-12
        ----------------
        
        * If a package is removed from ``auto-checkout`` and wasn't explicitly
        activated, then it will be removed from the develop packages automatically.
        In existing buildouts with an older mr.developer, you have to ``reset`` the
        packages first.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Added ``*`` wild card support for ``auto-checkout``.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Don't bail on subversion URLs ending in a slash or a revision marker.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Removed old way of specifying sources with ``sources-svn`` and
        ``sources-git``.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Exit immediately when there are issues during checkout when running as
        extension.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Use verbosity from buildout when running as extension.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Fix buildout_dir in ``develop`` script, so it is properly escaped on
        Windows.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Changed the output of ``list -s`` to match the one from ``status``.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Added troubleshooting section to readme.
        [miohtama, fschulze]
        
        * All commands have a ``-h`` and ``--help`` option now to show their help.
        [fschulze]
        
        1.1 - 2009-08-07
        ----------------
        
        * Use relative paths from the buildout directory for the ``develop`` option
        if possible. This fixes issues if your buildout path contains a space.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Warn when trying to activate or deactivate a package which isn't checked out.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Don't depend on elementree on Python >= 2.5, because it's builtin there.
        [fschulze]
        
        * When checking out a source it will automatically be activated.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Use 'sources' as the default section name for source information.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Added support for filesystem packages without version control with the
        'fs' type.
        [fschulze]
        
        1.0.1 - 2009-05-05
        ------------------
        
        * Fixed case sensitivity of package names for several commands.
        [fschulze]
        
        * SVN externals no longer cause a modified status.
        [fschulze]
        
        1.0 - 2009-05-02
        ----------------
        
        * Added ``info`` command to print various informations about packages.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Added ``reset`` command to reset the develop state of packages. This is
        useful when switching to a new buildout configuration. During the next
        buildout run the develop state is determined the same way as in a clean
        buildout.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Got rid of deprecation warning in Python 2.6 by removing unnecessary call
        of __init__ in working copy implementations.
        [fschulze]
        
        0.15 - 2009-04-17
        -----------------
        
        * Added reminder to run buildout after activating or deactivating packages.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Added ``rebuild`` command to rerun buildout with the last used arguments.
        [fschulze]
        
        0.14 - 2009-04-16
        -----------------
        
        * Fixed verbose output of ``checkout`` command.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Added ``-f`` option to ``update`` command to force updates even if the
        working copy is dirty.
        [fschulze]
        
        0.13 - 2009-04-14
        -----------------
        
        * Added ``-a`` option to ``update`` command to only update the packages
        declared in the ``auto-checkout`` list.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Added ``activate`` and ``deactivate`` commands. This allows to select which
        packages are added to the ``develop`` option of zc.buildout. Enhanced the
        ``status`` command to show the additional informations.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Switched the meaning of ``~`` and ``C`` in status command.
        [fschulze]
        
        0.12 - 2009-04-14
        -----------------
        
        * Added support for Mercurial (hg).
        [mj]
        
        * Refactored working copy logic, so it's easier to add support for other
        version control systems.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Added verbose flag to ``checkout`` and ``update`` commands.
        [fschulze]
        
        0.11 - 2009-04-06
        -----------------
        
        * Removed the nice os.path.relpath usage, because it's only been introduced
        with Python 2.6.
        [fschulze]
        
        0.10 - 2009-04-06
        -----------------
        
        * Added verbose flag to ``status`` command.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Deprecated ``sources-svn`` and ``sources-git`` in favour of just ``sources``
        which allows more flexibility.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Changed ``status`` command to only check known paths and not the whole
        ``sources-dir`` path.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Add possibility to filter packages in ``update`` and ``status`` commands.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Tell the user at the end of the buildout run whether there have been any
        errors during automatic checkout.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Install the ``develop`` script as the first part instead of the last, so it
        can be used to fix problems.
        [fschulze]
        
        0.9 - 2009-03-30
        ----------------
        
        * When installed as just an egg, then the resulting ``develop`` script can be
        called from anywhere and will try to find the correct ``develop`` script
        from the current working directory and execute it.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Fixed help text formatting.
        [fschulze]
        
        0.8 - 2009-03-25
        ----------------
        
        * Added authentication support to subversion commands.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Added ``-a`` option to ``checkout`` command to limit matching to the
        packages declared by the ``auto-checkout`` option. If no further argument
        is given, then all the packages from ``auto-checkout`` are processed.
        [fschulze]
        
        0.7 - 2009-03-24
        ----------------
        
        * Added ``update`` command to ``checkout`` script.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Added ``status`` command to ``checkout`` script.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Added status flag to ``list`` command to indicate packages with wrong URL.
        [fschulze]
        
        * If the working copy is clean, then checkout automatically switches svn
        packages.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Skip on checkout errors during buildout, so the develop script is generated
        and you get a chance to inspect and fix the problems.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Check remote url and stop checkout if it differs.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Added various options to the ``list`` command.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Instead of the ``checkout`` script, there is now a ``develop`` script with
        various commands.
        [fschulze]
        
        0.6 - 2009-03-24
        ----------------
        
        * Added custom logging formatter for nicer output in the checkout script.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Removed the '-e' option, regular expression matching is the default now.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Made it possible to specify more than one regular expression without the
        need to use a pipe symbol and quotes.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Added help text for the checkout script to pypi page.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Add a warning to rerun buildout after checkout.
        [fschulze]
        
        0.5 - 2009-03-23
        ----------------
        
        * Make sure that the updated versions are actually used.
        [fschulze]
        
        0.4 - 2009-03-22
        ----------------
        
        * Fixed logging, which fixes the info message output.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Skip checkout of existing packages.
        [fschulze]
        
        0.3 - 2009-03-22
        ----------------
        
        * Fixed source distribution by adding a MANIFEST.in.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Added -e and -l options to checkout script.
        [fschulze]
        
        0.2 - 2009-03-22
        ----------------
        
        * Added ``auto-checkout`` option (only works with subversion at the moment).
        [fschulze]
        
        * Added support for git.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Throw error when trying to checkout unknown package.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Fixed target directory for checkouts.
