Requirements
============

``django-articles`` wants a modern version of Django--something after 1.1.  It used to rely on ``django.contrib.comments`` for commenting needs, but I recently switched to `Disqus <http://www.disqus.com/>`_.  Included herein is a management command to convert ``django.contrib.comments`` comments to Disqus.

This project also expects ``django.contrib.sites``, ``django.contrib.admin``, ``django.contrib.markup``, ``django.contrib.auth``, ``django.contrib.humanize``, and ``django.contrib.syndication`` to be properly installed.

Installation
============

Download ``django-articles`` using *one* of the following methods:

Checkout from Mercurial
-----------------------

{{{
hg clone http://django-articles.googlecode.com/hg/ django-articles
hg clone http://bitbucket.org/codekoala/django-articles/
}}}

Configuration
=============

First of all, you must add this project to your list of ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in ``settings.py``:

{{{
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.humanize',
    'django.contrib.markup',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.sites',
    'django.contrib.syndication',
    ...
    'articles',
    ...
)
}}}

Run ``manage.py syncdb``.  This creates a few tables in your database that are necessary for operation.

Next, set a couple of settings in your ``settings.py``:

 * ``DISQUS_USER_API_KEY``: Your user API key from Disqus.  This is free, and you can learn how to get it from  `Disqus's API Page <http://2ze.us/ME>`_ or you can try http://disqus.com/api/get_my_key/ when you're logged into Disqus.  You only need this one if you're going to be converting comments from ``django.contrib.comments`` to Disqus.
 * ``DISQUS_FORUM_SHORTNAME``: set this to ``True`` if you want to see markers on the map

When that's done, you should be able to begin using ``django-articles``!

Good luck!  Please contact me with any questions or concerns you have with the project!
