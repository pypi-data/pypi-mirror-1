Please refer to the user guide for detailed instalation instructions. 

If you have all the pre-requisites installed just edit the setup.py 
and check the database configuration.

IMPORTANT: If this is your first installation, please set the upgrade variable,
on the setup.py file to 0.

Now you are set!

just type:
    
python setup.py install

Note that if one or more of the pre-requisites are missing, this
installation will not fail, but EpiGrass will not run.

enjoy!
