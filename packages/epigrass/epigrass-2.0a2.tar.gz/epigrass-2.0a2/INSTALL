Thank you for Downloading Epigrass. 

Epigrass can only be run on Linux or other platforms where Qt 3.x can be installed. This makes it very complicated to run Epigrass on Windows. This issue should be resolved when Epigrass is ported to Qt version 4 which is availables for windows under the GPL. Until now, if you want to run Epigrass but don't have access to Linux, Consider installing in a virtual machine (such as VirtualBox inside windows)


Epigrass depends on many other software packages:
    Qt 3.x
    PyQt 3.x
    Numpy
    Matplotlib
    Visual Python
    Gdal-Python
    SQLObject
    MySQLdb
    A LaTeX installation

When you have all the pre-requisites installed, enter the directory where you unpacked Epigrass and just type:
    
python setup.py install

Note that if one or more of the pre-requisites are missing, this
installation may not fail, but EpiGrass will not run. However, if you run Epigrass from a console, you will get an error message as to what dependency is missing.

If you want to help making the installation of Epigrass less of a hassle, please contact me!

enjoy!
