What's New in version 2.0a1
=======================
 - Completely migrated to PyQt 4
 - Removed many dependencies, added one: PyQwt5
 - New Documentation now generated by Sphinx (still not complete because of the lack of suport for math expressions on ReST). 
 - New website now hosted on Metamodellers.com
 - 2 new executables: epgeditor and epgrunner (see docs for more info)
 - GUI-less operation (through epirunner)
 - Completely new and improved visualization tool, built with PyQt4 and PyQwt5
 - Revamped export of spread trees as GraphML
 - Redesigned and hopefully better GUI
 - Metadata database  table now generated with the contents of the .epg file which generated  the simulation.
 - Spanish translation added. (thanks Naco!)
 - Many, many bugs fixed! and some more certainly created... :-(
