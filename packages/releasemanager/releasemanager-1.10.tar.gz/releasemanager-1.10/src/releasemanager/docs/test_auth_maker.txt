this test simply proves that authmaker, when instantiated without any plugin arguments
will set it's own auth attribute to be AnonymousAuth, and will defer its authenticate
and authorize methods to its auth attribute (as it always would), which in the case
of AnonymousAuth will always return True.

>>> from releasemanager.auth import AuthMaker
>>> a = AuthMaker()
>>> a.auth.__class__
<class 'releasemanager.auth.AnonymousAuth'>
>>> a.authorize()
True
>>> a.authenticate()
True
>>> credentials = {"username" : "fake", "password" : "doesntmatter"}
>>> a.authorize(credentials)
True
>>> a.authenticate(credentials)
True
