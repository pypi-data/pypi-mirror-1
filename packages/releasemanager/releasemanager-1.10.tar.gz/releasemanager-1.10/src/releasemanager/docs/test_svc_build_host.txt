it's worth noting that this test has a signficant flaw:
i can't reliably mock a twisted xmlrpc server, so the test
is dependent on having remotely started a template buildhost
at localhost:9999

also, if the hosting for svn on googlecode is down, this test will break


>>> import os
>>> from releasemanager.tests import TEST_CONF_PATH
>>> from xmlrpclib import ServerProxy
>>> url = "http://localhost:9999"
>>> s = ServerProxy(url)
>>> credentials = dict(username = 'relman_test', password = 'relman_test')
>>> request_data = dict(project = 'template', trunk=True)
>>> status, resource = s.build(credentials, request_data)
>>> success_msg = "GoogleCode svn must be alive, and the project checked out..."
>>> failure_msg = "GoogleCode is down, and project couldn't be checked out.  You will get an error"
>>> if status:
...     print success_msg
... else:
...     print failure_msg
...
GoogleCode svn must be alive, and the project checked out...
>>>
>>> output_path = os.path.join(TEST_CONF_PATH, "..%sarchive%stest_svc_build_host_resource.zip" % (os.sep, os.sep))
>>> open(output_path, 'w').write(resource.data)
