Quickstart
==========

Because you're just as impatient as I am.

Assuming you've installed already using setuptools, a new script called relman_ctl should be in your path.  If you're on Win32 systems, make sure that your python installation's Scripts directory is in your PATH.

From the command line, move to a directory where you intend to run ReleaseManager.  Try the following:

relman_ctl generate builder <the name of your builder>

If you look in the new directory, you should see a new set of files.  Change directory to the new builder directory.  Then run this:

python serve.py

You should notice that a new Twisted xmlrpc server starts up.  Close it down, and cd back out of the directory.

*Note*
If you want to use a built-in authentication plugin (like SimpleAuth in this example), instead of the above command, run this one instead:

relman_ctl generate builder <the name of your builder> -a simpleauth

This will create a plugins/auth directory as well, and the simpleauth wrapper will be available.  This, of course, presumes that you have the actual libraries for your chosen plugin actually installed, and available on PYTHONPATH.  SimpleAuth is not bundled with ReleaseManager, so if you want to use that plugin, it's a separate install, available at www.simpleauth.com, or at code.google.com/p/simpleauth.

The Rest
========

The same commands will work for manager and installer (in the place of builder).  This will get fresh installs of the template base up and available quickly, and should act as a decent model for extension.

Look through the README and the docs directory to get an idea of how this is used.  Look at the way the template builder is designed, and what the template installer is really doing (which is not much).  Look through the configuration xml files for each one.  They're fairly self-explanatory, and where they're not, either look at the docs, change some values and see what happens.
