issues:
[ ] should make sure model isn't serialized multiple times
  - queue changes in session?
[ ] need a decoupled way to tweak things like form titles
[X] need correct field ordering

general:
[ ] docs
- tests
 [ ] roadrunner
 [ ] doctests for basic walkthrough
[ ] i18n infrastructure (use message factory from plone.dexterity?)
[X] register dexterity configlet
 - how to get Plone control panel wrapper for z3c forms?
[ ] make sure plone.schemaeditor can be used by some other product like PFG
 - need to be able to override form template, mutate form fields

schema editor:
- functionality:
 [X] actually read/write values from schemata
 [X] handle default and missing values
 [X] adding/removing fields
 [ ] copy/paste or add based on an existing type/field
 [ ] rename type
 [ ] handle widget selection
 [ ] handle vocabularies
 [X] field ordering
 [ ] fieldsets -- including integration with behaviors (weighting?)
 [ ] editing dexterity metadata like permissions
- UI:
 [X] breadcrumbs niceties
 [ ] page title in <head>
 [ ] make fields form look more like Trac filtering, have draggable ordering
 [ ] pop up field editing form in something lightbox-y

design issues:
- UI design for managing multiple fieldsets / schemata
- figure out what to do about vocabularies
- figure out what to do about Choice item types

examples / dogfooding / things to test:
- build a geolocation behavior
- handling of pre-existing content
