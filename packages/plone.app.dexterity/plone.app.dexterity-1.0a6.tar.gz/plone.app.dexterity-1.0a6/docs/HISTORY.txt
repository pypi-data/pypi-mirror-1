Changelog
=========

1.0a6 - 2009-10-12
------------------

* Add plone.app.textfield as a dependency. We don't use it directly in this
  package, but users of Dexterity should have it installed and available.
  [optilude]

* Use some default icons for new types.
  [davisagli]

* Show type icons in type listing if available.
  [davisagli]

* Removed 'container' field from the types listing in the control panel
  (it wasn't working).
  [davisagli]

* Add message factories to titles and descriptions of metadata schema fields.
  Fixes http://code.google.com/p/dexterity/issues/detail?id=75.
  [optilude]

* Patch listActionInfos() instead of listActions() in order to get the
  folder/add category into the actions list. This avoids a problem with
  the 'actions.xml' export handler exporting the folder/add category
  incorrectly. Fixes http://code.google.com/p/dexterity/issues/detail?id=78
  [optilude]

1.0a5 - 2009-07-26
------------------

* Explicitly include overrides.zcml from plone.app.z3cform.
  [optilude]

1.0a4 - 2009-07-12
------------------

* Changed API methods and arguments to mixedCase to be more consistent with
  the rest of Zope. This is a non-backwards-compatible change. Our profuse
  apologies, but it's now or never. :-/

  If you find that you get import errors or unknown keyword arguments in your
  code, please change names from foo_bar too fooBar, e.g. serialize_schema()
  becomes serializeSchema().
  [optilude]

1.0a3 (2009-06-07)
------------------

* Updated use of <plone:behavior /> directive to match plone.behavior 1.0b4.
  [optilude]

1.0a2 (2009-06-01)
------------------

* Remove superfluous <includeOverrides /> in configure.zcml which would cause
  a problem when the package is loaded via z3c.autoinclude.plugin
  [optilude]

1.0a1 - (2009-05-27)
--------------------

* Initial release
