Description: Overview
        ========
        
        The z3c.jbot (or "Just a bunch of templates") package allows drop-in
        page template overrides.
        
        It works by giving page templates a canonical filename which you can
        use to provide a replacement in your own package. Simply register a
        template overrides directory and give your new template the canonical
        filename.
        
        Overrides may be registered for a specific layer or any layer.
        
        Canonical filename
        ------------------
        
        The canonical filename is defined as the path relative to the package
        within which the template is located with directory separators
        replaced with dots.
        
        Example:
        
        Suppose you want to override: /plone/app/layout/viewlets/logo.pt
        You would use the filename:   plone.app.layout.viewlets.logo.pt
        
        Registering a on overrides directory
        ------------------------------------
        
        A Zope component configuration directive is available to configure
        overrides::
        
        <include package="z3c.jbot" file="meta.zcml" />
        
        <browser:templateOverrides
        directory="<directory>"
        layer="<layer>" />
        
        Performance considerations
        --------------------------
        
        The use of jbot adds to the general page load time. On a site with
        many templates this may be as much as 10 ms per request.
