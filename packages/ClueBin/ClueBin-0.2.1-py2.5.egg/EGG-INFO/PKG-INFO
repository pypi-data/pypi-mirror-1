        Overview
        ========
        
        ClueBin is a pastebin application with colour-syntax support for most major
        text formats.  It is implemented as a WSGI application and easily integrates with
        WSGI stacks.  The data backend is configurable and currently there are datastores
        for Google App Engine (BigTable) and SQLAlchemy (SQLite by default).

        * (required) Pygments 0.9+
        
        * (required) WebOb 0.9.1+
        
        * (optional) SQLAlchemy: only required if you want SQL-based datastore support

        Installation
        ============
        
        ClueBin was designed to be installed using standard easy_install methods.  A
        simple "easy_install ClueBin" should suffice.  This should generate a new
        script called ``cluebin``.
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        ClueBin was designed to be a pluggable WSGI app.  The factory for this app is
        ``cluebin.pastebin.make_app``.
        
        To setup ClueBin within it's own constrained directory try using virtualenv
        from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv/1.0  Once virtualenv is installed
        do this::
        
        $ virtualenv cluebinenv
        $ cd cluebinenv
        $ ./bin/easy_install SQLAlchemy
        $ ./bin/easy_install ClueBin
        
        To use ClueBin in stand-alone mode, run the ``cluebin`` script.  See the help
        usage for standard information.
        ::
        
        $ ./bin/cluebin -h
        
        Here is an example of running ClueBin against a local ``foo.db`` sqlite db.
        Make sure your local PYTHONPATH includes both SQLAlchemy and python SQLite
        bindings.
        ::
        
        $ ./bin/cluebin -s cluebin.sqldata.SqlPasteDataStore sqlite:///foo.db True
        
        The ``-s`` option takes some random datastore factory name.  All extra arguments
        are passed as arguments to the factory call.  For the sql based datastore
        the current arguments are "db-uri" and an optional second argument to determine
        if the base schema should be auto-created.
