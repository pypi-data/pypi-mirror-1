Description: 
        YABT: A context sensitive string manipulation tool
        
        YABT is a context sensitive string manipulation tool written in pure python. It has two main goals:
        * Provide implementations of string manipulation for specific tasks to be used inside applications. The current
        implementation is a context matching rule system combined with a finite state machine and a table for translating text
        into British Braille. This implementation should be useful for other tasks such as preparing text for a speech
        synthesiser by providing different tables.
        * To provide a framework which developers can use to create new translation algorithms which can be used by any
        application using YABT. This side of YABT could do with further development and so is most likely going t see some
        changes as YABT matures.
