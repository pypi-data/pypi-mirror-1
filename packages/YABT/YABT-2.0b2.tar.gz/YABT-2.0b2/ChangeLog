After not adding details to this file, plenty has been altered.
* YABT is now on its 2.0 branch
* Separating rules out from the translator to generalise YABT for other uses and other implementations.
* Added separate loaders so that other table formats can be created, this helps support other rule types.
* Total rewrite, this cleans up the code so much, and also has lead to a significant performance boost.

Added a description, this goes forward as YABT-1.0.0Update1.

Changing things to use setuptools for install. Everything seems to work well, if possibly slightly slowly, just need to 
check that distributions (source) come out without problems.

Making some final preparations for release 1.0. These include tidying up the code and documentation, including a license 
file and adding some helpful preprocess functions in the module YABT.preprocess.

Modified the translation table format to support the <char> tag which is to get around the limitations of xml 1.0. This 
tag has been documented in README.


24/11/2007

Cleaned up the code and changed the code to use the configuration files for custom match type contexts. This seems to be 
working properly but will need to be corrected for a couple of characters \x0b and \x0c which seem to cause problems in 
xml.
