Changing things to use setuptools for install. Everything seems to work well, if possibly slightly slowly, just need to 
check that distributions (source) come out without problems.

Making some final preparations for release 1.0. These include tidying up the code and documentation, including a license 
file and adding some helpful preprocess functions in the module YABT.preprocess.

Modified the translation table format to support the <char> tag which is to get around the limitations of xml 1.0. This 
tag has been documented in README.

Cleaned up the code and changed the code to use the configuration files for custom match type contexts. This seems to be 
working properly but will need to be corrected for a couple of characters \x0b and \x0c which seem to cause problems in 
xml.
