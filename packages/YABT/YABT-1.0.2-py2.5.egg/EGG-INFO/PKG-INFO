Description: 
        YABT: Yet another Braille Translator
        
        YABT is a general purpose Braille translation system written in pure python. It is primarily designed to be used by the
        `BrlTex Project <http://brltex.sf.net>`_, but due to its general design it may be suited to use in other projects.
        
        Currently YABT has a table for translation in to British Braille encoded in ASCII Braille, but tables for other codes
        and other output encodings such as unicode Braille are possible.
