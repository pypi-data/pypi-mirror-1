Summary: xdv implements a subset of Deliverance using a pure XSLT engine. With xdv, you
"compile" your theme and ruleset in one step, then use a superfast/simple
transform on each request thereafter. Alternatively, compile your theme during
development, check it into Subversion, and not touch xdv during deployment.
