        collective.testcaselayer
        ========================
        
        The support for layers provided by zope.testing helps to lessen the
        amount of time consumed during test driven development by sharing
        expensive test fixtures, such as is often requires for functional
        test.  This package provides several well tested facilities to make
        writing and using layers faster and easier.
        
        Quick Start
        ===========
        
        For a simple testing layer which installs a collective namespace
        package into Zope and installs it's GenericSetup profile into the
        PloneTestCase Plone site you can do the following.
        
        Specify the testing dependency on collective.testcaselayer in the
        egg's setup.py::
        
        from setuptools import setup, find_packages
        ...
        tests_require = ['collective.testcaselayer']
        ...
        setup(name='collective.foo',
        ...
        install_requires=[
        'setuptools',
        # -*- Extra requirements: -*-
        ],
        tests_require=tests_require,
        extras_require={'tests': tests_require},
        ...
        entry_points="""
        
        Tell your buildout to include the testing dependencies.  This is only
        necessary for deployments where you'll be running the tests.  As such,
        you can leave this out of your production buildout configuration and
        put it only in your buildout's development configuration::
        
        ...
        eggs +=
        collective.foo [tests]
        ...
        
        Define the layer.  You could use a collective.foo.testing module like
        this:
        
        >>> from Products.PloneTestCase import ptc
        >>>
        >>> from collective.testcaselayer import ptc as tcl_ptc
        >>>
        >>> class Layer(tcl_ptc.BasePTCLayer):
        ...     """Install collective.foo"""
        ...
        ...     def afterSetUp(self):
        ...         ZopeTestCase.installPackage('collective.foo')
        ...         self.addProfile('collective.foo:default')
        >>>
        >>> layer = Layer([tcl_ptc.ptc_layer])
        
        To use this layer in a README.txt doctest, you could use a
        collective.foo.tests module like this:
        
        >>> import unittest
        >>> from zope.testing import doctest
        >>>
        >>> from Testing import ZopeTestCase
        >>> from Products.PloneTestCase import ptc
        >>>
        >>> from collective.foo import testing
        >>>
        >>> optionflags = (doctest.NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE|
        ...                doctest.ELLIPSIS|
        ...                doctest.REPORT_NDIFF)
        >>>
        >>> def test_suite():
        ...     suite = ZopeTestCase.FunctionalDocFileSuite(
        ...         'README.txt',
        ...         optionflags=optionflags,
        ...         test_class=ptc.FunctionalTestCase)
        ...     suite.layer = testing.layer
        ...     return suite
        >>>
        >>> if __name__ == '__main__':
        ...     unittest.main(defaultTest='test_suite')
        
        Now write your README.txt doctest and your tests can be run with
        something like::
        
        $ bin/instance test -s collective.foo

        Layer authors often end up reproducing the functionality provided by
        their test case classes since the same functionality is needed to
        perform layer set up or tear down.  The collective.testcaselayer.ztc,
        collective.testcaselayer.ctc, and collective.testcaselayer.ptc modules
        provide layer base classes that mix in the test case functionality from
        ZopeTestCase, CMFTestCase, and PloneTestCase, respectively.  See the
        collective.testcaselayer.ztc, and collective.testcaselayer.ptc
        sections below (or ztc.txt and ptc.txt if reading this in the source)
        for more details.  These layer base classes also include the layer
        base class support from collective.testcaselayer.layer and the
        sandboxed ZODB layer support from collective.testcaselayer.sandbox
        described below.  Additionally, these modules allow for using the test
        case fixtures as layers themselves.
        
        While class objects can be used as layers, as opposed to instances of
        classes, doing so means that it is not possible for a layer to
        subclass another layer *just* to re-use functionality without also
        depending on that layer being set up as well.  See the
        collective.testcaselayer.layer section below (or layer.txt if reading
        this in the source) for more details.
        
        The DemoStorage included with the ZODB provides a way to "nest" ZODB
        stores such that all writes will go to the DemoStorage while reads
        will be taken from the base storage if not available from the
        DemoStorage.  The collective.testcaselayer.sandbox module uses this
        feature to associate a DemoStorage with each sandboxed layer to which
        set up changes are committed and restore the base storage on tear
        down.  Thus sibling layers that write to the ZODB can be isolated from
        each other.  See the collective.testcaselayer.sandbox section below
        (or sandbox.txt if reading this in the source) for more details.

        collective.testcaselayer.ptc
        ============================
        
        The collective.testcaselayer.ptc module extends the layers and layer
        base classes from collective.testcaselayer.ztc to PloneTestCase.  See
        ztc.txt for an introduction to using the layers and layer base
        classes.  Here we will only demonstrate that the facilities specific
        to PloneTestCase not inherited from ZopeTestCase.
        
        Layers
        ------
        
        The PloneTestCase test fixture can be set up and torn down as a layer.
        
        >>> from collective.testcaselayer import ptc
        >>> ptc.ptc_layer
        <collective.testcaselayer.ptc.PTCLayer testMethod=layerOnly>
        
        To test the effects of just this layer, set up the base layer
        separately.  Because of the way PloneTestCase uses layers, we must first
        call the setupPloneSite() function.
        
        >>> from zope.testing.testrunner import runner
        >>> from Products.PloneTestCase import ptc as plone_ptc
        >>> plone_ptc.setupPloneSite()
        >>> plonesite_layer, = ptc.ptc_layer.__bases__
        >>> options = runner.get_options([], [])
        >>> setup_layers = {}
        >>> runner.setup_layer(options, plonesite_layer, setup_layers)
        Set up Products.PloneTestCase.layer.ZCML in ... seconds.
        Set up Products.PloneTestCase.layer.PloneSite in ... seconds.
        
        The PloneTestCase test fixture has not been set up.
        
        >>> from Testing import ZopeTestCase
        >>> app = ZopeTestCase.app()
        >>> portal = getattr(app, plone_ptc.portal_name)
        >>> portal.acl_users.getUserById(plone_ptc.default_user)
        >>> ZopeTestCase.close(app)
        
        Set up the PloneTestCase layer.
        
        >>> runner.setup_layer(options, ptc.ptc_layer, setup_layers)
        Set up collective.testcaselayer.ptc.PTCLayer in ... seconds.
        
        The PloneTestCase test fixture has been set up.
        
        >>> app = ZopeTestCase.app()
        >>> portal = getattr(app, plone_ptc.portal_name)
        >>> portal.acl_users.getUserById(plone_ptc.default_user)
        <PloneUser 'test_user_1_'>
        >>> ZopeTestCase.close(app)
        
        Tear down the PloneTestCase layer.
        
        >>> runner.tear_down_unneeded(
        ...     options,
        ...     [layer for layer in setup_layers
        ...      if layer is not ptc.ptc_layer],
        ...     setup_layers)
        Tear down collective.testcaselayer.ptc.PTCLayer in ... seconds.
        
        The PloneTestCase test fixture is no longer set up.
        
        >>> app = ZopeTestCase.app()
        >>> portal = getattr(app, plone_ptc.portal_name)
        >>> portal.acl_users.getUserById(plone_ptc.default_user)
        >>> ZopeTestCase.close(app)
        
        Layer Base Classes
        ------------------
        
        The PloneTestCase class facilities can also be used in layers that use
        the PloneTestCase layer base class.
        
        >>> class FooLayer(ptc.BasePTCLayer):
        ...     def afterSetUp(self):
        ...         self.addProfile(
        ...             'Products.CMFDefault:sample_content')
        ...         self.addProduct('CollectiveTestCaseLayerTesting')
        ...         self.loginAsPortalOwner()
        
        This layer depends on the profile and product added which are set up
        in a testing only layer.
        
        >>> from collective.testcaselayer.testing import layer
        >>> foo_layer = FooLayer([layer.product_layer, ptc.ptc_layer])
        
        The FooLayer test fixture has not been set up.
        
        >>> app = ZopeTestCase.app()
        >>> portal = getattr(app, plone_ptc.portal_name)
        
        >>> hasattr(portal, 'subfolder')
        False
        >>> hasattr(portal, 'foo')
        False
        
        >>> from AccessControl import SecurityManagement
        >>> SecurityManagement.getSecurityManager().getUser()
        <SpecialUser 'Anonymous User'>
        
        >>> ZopeTestCase.close(app)
        
        Set up the FooLayer.
        
        >>> runner.setup_layer(options, foo_layer, setup_layers)
        Set up collective.testcaselayer.testing.layer.ProductLayer
        in ... seconds.
        Set up FooLayer in ... seconds.
        
        The FooLayer test fixture has been set up.
        
        >>> app = ZopeTestCase.app()
        >>> portal = getattr(app, plone_ptc.portal_name)
        
        >>> portal.subfolder
        <ATFolder at /plone/subfolder>
        >>> portal.foo
        'foo'
        
        >>> from AccessControl import SecurityManagement
        >>> SecurityManagement.getSecurityManager().getUser()
        <PropertiedUser 'portal_owner'>
        
        >>> ZopeTestCase.close(app)
        
        Tear down the FooLayer.
        
        >>> runner.tear_down_unneeded(
        ...     options,
        ...     [layer for layer in setup_layers
        ...      if layer is not foo_layer],
        ...     setup_layers)
        Tear down FooLayer in ... seconds.
        
        The FooLayer test fixture is no longer set up.
        
        >>> app = ZopeTestCase.app()
        >>> portal = getattr(app, plone_ptc.portal_name)
        
        >>> hasattr(portal, 'subfolder')
        False
        >>> hasattr(portal, 'foo')
        False
        
        >>> from AccessControl import SecurityManagement
        >>> SecurityManagement.getSecurityManager().getUser()
        <SpecialUser 'Anonymous User'>
        
        >>> ZopeTestCase.close(app)
        
        Finish tearing down the rest of the layers.
        
        >>> runner.tear_down_unneeded(options, [], setup_layers)
        Tear down collective.testcaselayer.testing.layer.ProductLayer
        in ... seconds.
        Tear down Products.PloneTestCase.layer.PloneSite in ... seconds.
        Tear down Products.PloneTestCase.layer.ZCML in ... seconds.
        
        .. -*-doctest-*-
        
        collective.testcaselayer.ztc
        ============================
        
        The BaseZTCLayer and cousins are intended to be used as base classes
        for layers to allow them to use the facilities of ZopeTestCase,
        PortalTestCase, and their subclasses.  Thus, the layer setUp and
        tearDown methods can use the test case methods and other support such
        as: self.login(), self.logout(), self.loginAsPortalOwner(),
        self.setRoles(), self.setPermissions(), etc..
        
        The ZTCLayer and cousins allow using the test fixture setup by any of
        the test cases as a layer itself.
        
        The collective.testcaselayer.ctc and collective.testcaselayer.ptc
        modules extend this support to CMFTestCase and PloneTestCase, though
        collective.testcaselayer does not depend on them itself.  These layer
        base classes allow for use of those test cases' methods such as
        addProfile() and addProduct() see ctc.txt and ptc.txt for more
        details.
        
        Layers
        ------
        
        The collective.testcaselayer.ztc module provides sandboxed layers that
        set up the test fixtures for ZopeTestCase.  Note that test case based
        layers still act like test cases with a special no-op layerOnly() test
        method to that they have functional str() and repr() values.
        
        >>> from collective.testcaselayer import ztc
        >>> ztc.ztc_layer
        <collective.testcaselayer.ztc.ZTCLayer testMethod=layerOnly>
        
        Before we set up ZopeTestCase as a layer, nothing has been set up.
        
        >>> from AccessControl import SecurityManagement
        >>> SecurityManagement.getSecurityManager().getUser()
        <SpecialUser 'Anonymous User'>
        
        >>> hasattr(ztc.ztc_layer, 'app')
        False
        
        >>> from Testing import ZopeTestCase
        >>> app = ZopeTestCase.app()
        >>> app.objectValues()
        [<UserFolder at /acl_users>,
        <ApplicationManager at /Control_Panel>]
        >>> ZopeTestCase.close(app)
        
        >>> from Testing.ZopeTestCase import connections
        >>> connections.count()
        0
        
        Set up ZopeTestCase as a layer.
        
        >>> from zope.testing.testrunner import runner
        >>> options = runner.get_options([], [])
        >>> setup_layers = {}
        >>> runner.setup_layer(options, ztc.ztc_layer, setup_layers)
        Set up collective.testcaselayer.ztc.ZTCLayer in ... seconds.
        
        The ZopeTestCase test fixture has been set up, but there is no logged
        in user.
        
        >>> SecurityManagement.getSecurityManager().getUser()
        <SpecialUser 'Anonymous User'>
        
        >>> ztc.ztc_layer.app.objectValues()
        [<UserFolder at /acl_users>,
        <ApplicationManager at /Control_Panel>,
        <Folder at /test_folder_1_>]
        
        Also note that the app attribute of the layer represents an open
        connection to the ZODB.
        
        >>> connections.count()
        1
        
        Tear down the ZopeTestCase layer.
        
        >>> runner.tear_down_unneeded(options, [], setup_layers)
        Tear down collective.testcaselayer.ztc.ZTCLayer in ... seconds.
        
        Now everything is back to its previous state.
        
        >>> SecurityManagement.getSecurityManager().getUser()
        <SpecialUser 'Anonymous User'>
        
        >>> hasattr(ztc.ztc_layer, 'app')
        False
        
        >>> from Testing import ZopeTestCase
        >>> app = ZopeTestCase.app()
        >>> app.objectValues()
        [<UserFolder at /acl_users>,
        <ApplicationManager at /Control_Panel>]
        >>> ZopeTestCase.close(app)
        
        >>> connections.count()
        0
        
        Layer Base Classes
        ------------------
        
        The collective.testcaselayer.ztc module also provides base classes for
        sandboxed layers that don't actually set up the test case fixtures but
        allow using the facilities provided by the test cases in the layer set
        up and tear down code.
        
        Since layers can be nested, these layer base classes don't do the
        actual ZopeTestCase test fixture set up unless a subclass explicitly
        sets _setup_fixture (or _configure_portal for PortalTestCase) to True.
        Best practice should be to instantiate any layers depending on the ZTC
        test fixture with the ZTCLayer as a base layer as above.
        
        Create a layer class that subclasses the appropriate base layer class.
        This layer class overrides the afterSetUp() method just as with
        ZopeTestCase based test cases.  The afterSetUp method here excercises
        the factilities provided by ZopeTestCase.
        
        >>> class FooLayer(ztc.BaseZTCLayer):
        ...     def afterSetUp(self):
        ...         self.login()
        ...         self.setRoles(['Manager'])
        >>> foo_layer = FooLayer([ztc.ztc_layer])
        
        To test the effects of just this layer, set up the base layer
        separately.
        
        >>> runner.setup_layer(options, ztc.ztc_layer, setup_layers)
        Set up collective.testcaselayer.ztc.ZTCLayer in ... seconds.
        
        Before setting up the new layer, only the ZopeTestCase fixture is set
        up.
        
        >>> SecurityManagement.getSecurityManager().getUser()
        <SpecialUser 'Anonymous User'>
        
        >>> app = ZopeTestCase.app()
        >>> user = getattr(app, ZopeTestCase.folder_name
        ...                ).acl_users.getUserById(ZopeTestCase.user_name)
        >>> user.getRoles()
        ('test_role_1_', 'Authenticated')
        >>> ZopeTestCase.close(app)
        
        Set up the new layer.
        
        >>> runner.setup_layer(options, foo_layer, setup_layers)
        Set up FooLayer in ... seconds.
        
        Now the changed made by afterSetUp() are reflected.
        
        >>> authenticated = SecurityManagement.getSecurityManager(
        ...     ).getUser()
        >>> authenticated
        <User 'test_user_1_'>
        >>> authenticated.getRoles()
        ('Manager', 'Authenticated')
        
        Tear down just the new layer.
        
        >>> runner.tear_down_unneeded(
        ...     options, [ztc.ztc_layer], setup_layers)
        Tear down FooLayer in ... seconds.
        
        Everything is restored to its previous state.
        
        >>> SecurityManagement.getSecurityManager().getUser()
        <SpecialUser 'Anonymous User'>
        
        >>> app = ZopeTestCase.app()
        >>> user = getattr(app, ZopeTestCase.folder_name
        ...                ).acl_users.getUserById(ZopeTestCase.user_name)
        >>> user.getRoles()
        ('test_role_1_', 'Authenticated')
        >>> ZopeTestCase.close(app)
        
        Finish tearing down the rest of the layers.
        
        >>> runner.tear_down_unneeded(options, [], setup_layers)
        Tear down collective.testcaselayer.ztc.ZTCLayer in ... seconds.

        In many cases, classes can be used as layers themselves where the base
        classes are used as the base layers.  This means that the layer
        inheritance herirarchy, used for code factoring and re-use, becomes
        bound to the layer set up heirachy, used to determine which layers are
        set up when and for which tests.  IOW, it is not possible for a layer
        to subclass another layer *just* to re-use functionality without also
        depending on that layer being set up as well.  Additionally, when
        using classes as layers, all layer methods (setUp, tearDown,
        testSetUp, and testTearDown) must be defined on class layers with base
        classes to avoid accidentally running the method of a base class/layer
        at the wrong time.
        
        The collective.testcaselayer.layer module provides a Layer class
        intended to be used as a base class for classes whoss instances will
        be layers.  Instances of this class can also be used directly solely
        to group layers together into one layer.
        
        >>> from collective.testcaselayer import layer
        
        Layer Classes
        -------------
        
        Use the collective.testcaselayer.layer.Layer class to create your own
        layer classes.
        
        >>> class FooLayer(layer.Layer):
        ...     def setUp(self): print 'running FooLayer.setUp'
        
        The instances of the class will be your actual zope.testing layer.
        
        >>> foo_layer = FooLayer()
        
        >>> from zope.testing.testrunner import runner
        >>> options = runner.get_options([], [])
        >>> runner.setup_layer(options, foo_layer, {})
        Set up FooLayer running FooLayer.setUp
        in ... seconds.
        
        Beware that the Layer class itself or subclasses can be used
        themselves as layers without error but that is not how they're
        intended to be used.  For example, using the FooLayer class as a layer
        will treat the Layer base class as a layer itself and will set it up
        which is meaningless.  Further, it will try to call the setUp method
        as a class method which will raise an error.
        
        >>> runner.setup_layer(options, FooLayer, {})
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        TypeError: unbound method setUp() must be called with FooLayer instance as first argument (got nothing instead)
        
        Base Layers
        -----------
        
        Base layers are designated by passing them into the layer class on
        instantiation.
        
        Create another layer class.
        
        >>> class BarLayer(layer.Layer):
        ...     def setUp(self): print 'running BarLayer.setUp'
        
        Create the new layer that uses foo_layer as a base layer.
        
        >>> bar_layer = BarLayer([foo_layer])
        
        Set up the layers.
        
        >>> runner.setup_layer(options, bar_layer, {})
        Set up FooLayer running FooLayer.setUp
        in ... seconds.
        Set up BarLayer running BarLayer.setUp
        in ... seconds.
        
        Grouping Layers
        ---------------
        
        If all that's required from a layer is that it groups other layers as
        base layers, then the collective.testcaselayer.layer.Layer class can
        be used directly.
        
        Create another layer.
        
        >>> class BazLayer(layer.Layer):
        ...     def setUp(self): print 'running BazLayer.setUp'
        >>> baz_layer = BazLayer()
        
        Instantiate the Layer class with the base layers, a module, and a name.
        
        >>> qux_layer = layer.Layer(
        ...     [bar_layer, baz_layer],
        ...     module='QuxModule', name='QuxLayer')
        
        Set up the layers.
        
        >>> runner.setup_layer(options, qux_layer, {})
        Set up FooLayer running FooLayer.setUp
        in ... seconds.
        Set up BarLayer running BarLayer.setUp
        in ... seconds.
        Set up BazLayer running BazLayer.setUp
        in ... seconds.
        Set up QuxModule.QuxLayer in ... seconds.
        
        By default, layers have the same module and name as their class.  If
        you want the layer to have a different module or name than the class,
        then the both can be passed in as arguments.  This is useful in this
        case and any time multiple instances of the same layer class will be
        used as layers.
        
        Instantiating the Layer class directly without passing a name raises
        an error.
        
        >>> layer.Layer([], module='QuxModule')
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ValueError: The "name" argument is requied when instantiating
        "Layer" directly
        
        If the Layer class is instantiated directly without passing a module,
        the module name from the calling frame is used.
        
        >>> __name__ = 'BahModule'
        >>> quux_layer = layer.Layer([], name='QuuxLayer')
        >>> runner.setup_layer(options, quux_layer, {})
        Set up BahModule.QuuxLayer in ... seconds.
        
        .. -*-doctest-*-
        
        collective.testcaselayer.sandbox
        ================================
        
        Sandboxed layers commit the changes made on setup to a sandboxed
        DemoStorage that uses the previous ZODB storage as a base storgae.  On
        tear down, the layer will restore the base storage.  This allows the
        layer to use and commit changes to a fully functional ZODB while
        isolating the effects of the layer from any parent or sibling layers.
        
        As one would expect, layers that use the sandboxed layer as a base
        layer will see the ZODB according the base layer.  Additionally,
        sandboxed layers can use other sandboxed layers as base layers, thus
        allowing for nested but isolated ZODB sandboxes.
        
        Create a sandboxed layer.  Layers that subclass Sandboxed should
        implement an afterSetUp method to do any changes for the layer.
        Additionally, such layers may also provide a beforeTearDown method to
        tear down any changes made by the layer that won't be cleaned up by
        restoring the ZODB.
        
        >>> from collective.testcaselayer import ztc
        >>> class FooLayer(ztc.BaseZTCLayer):
        ...     def afterSetUp(self):
        ...         self.app.foo = 'foo'
        >>> foo_layer = FooLayer()
        
        Before the layer is set up, the ZODB doesn't reflect the layer's
        changes.
        
        >>> from Testing import ZopeTestCase
        >>> app = ZopeTestCase.app()
        >>> getattr(app, 'foo', None)
        >>> ZopeTestCase.close(app)
        
        After the layer is set up, the changes have been committed to the
        ZODB.
        
        >>> foo_layer.setUp()
        
        >>> app = ZopeTestCase.app()
        >>> getattr(app, 'foo', None)
        'foo'
        >>> ZopeTestCase.close(app)
        
        Create a sandboxed layer that uses the first layer as a base layer.
        
        >>> class BarLayer(ztc.BaseZTCLayer):
        ...     def afterSetUp(self):
        ...         self.app.bar = 'bar'
        >>> bar_layer = BarLayer([foo_layer])
        
        Before the sub-layer is set up, the ZODB still reflects the base
        layer's changes but not the sub-layer's changes.
        
        >>> app = ZopeTestCase.app()
        >>> getattr(app, 'foo', None)
        'foo'
        >>> getattr(app, 'bar', None)
        >>> ZopeTestCase.close(app)
        
        After the sub-layer is set up, the ZODB reflects the changes from both
        layers.
        
        >>> bar_layer.setUp()
        
        >>> app = ZopeTestCase.app()
        >>> getattr(app, 'foo', None)
        'foo'
        >>> getattr(app, 'bar', None)
        'bar'
        >>> ZopeTestCase.close(app)
        
        Any test case using Testing.ZopeTestCase.sandbox.Sandboxed, such as
        zope.testbrowser tests run against Zope2, calls the ZopeLite.sandbox()
        function without any arguments.  In such cases, the resulting per-test
        sandboxed ZODB will still be based on the layer sandboxed ZODB.
        
        >>> app = ZopeTestCase.Zope2.app(
        ...     ZopeTestCase.Zope2.sandbox().open())
        >>> getattr(app, 'foo', None)
        'foo'
        >>> getattr(app, 'bar', None)
        'bar'
        >>> app._p_jar.close()
        
        After the sub-layer is torn down, the ZODB reflects only the changes
        from the base layer.
        
        >>> bar_layer.tearDown()
        
        >>> app = ZopeTestCase.app()
        >>> getattr(app, 'foo', None)
        'foo'
        >>> getattr(app, 'bar', None)
        >>> ZopeTestCase.close(app)
        
        After the base layer is torn down, the ZODB doesn't reflect the changes
        from either layer.
        
        >>> foo_layer.tearDown()
        
        >>> app = ZopeTestCase.app()
        >>> getattr(app, 'foo', None)
        >>> getattr(app, 'bar', None)
        >>> ZopeTestCase.close(app)

        Functional and testbrowser testing patches
        ==========================================
        
        If you include the collective.testcaselayer configure.zcml, you'll get
        some monkey patches for some functional testing and testbrowser bugs:
        
        - bug #98437 - TestBrowser Referer: header set to 'localhost'
        https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/98437
        - Streaming data into the response don't work
        
        Add a document which renders the referer.
        
        >>> folder.addDTMLDocument(
        ...     'index_html', file='''\
        ... <html><body>
        ... <dtml-var "REQUEST['HTTP_REFERER']">
        ... <form action="." method="post" id="post"></form>
        ... <form action="." method="get" id="get"></form>
        ... <a href=".">link</a>
        ... </html></body>
        ... ''')
        ''
        
        Open a browser.
        
        >>> from Products.Five.testbrowser import Browser
        >>> browser = Browser()
        >>> browser.handleErrors = False
        
        Before patching, fresh requests have an invalid referer.
        
        >>> browser.open(folder.index_html.absolute_url())
        >>> print browser.contents
        <html><body>
        localhost

        <form action="." method="get" id="get"></form>
        <a href=".">link</a>
        </html></body>
        
        
        Add a script that streams content to the response.
        
        >>> from Products.PythonScripts import PythonScript
        >>> PythonScript.manage_addPythonScript(folder, 'foo.txt')
        ''
        >>> folder['foo.txt'].ZPythonScript_edit(params='', body='''\
        ... context.REQUEST.response.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain')
        ... context.REQUEST.response.setHeader(
        ...     'Content-Disposition',
        ...     'attachment;filename=foo.txt')
        ... context.REQUEST.response.write('foo')''')
        
        Before patching, data streamed to the response is not in the browser
        contents.
        
        >>> browser.open(folder['foo.txt'].absolute_url())
        >>> browser.isHtml
        False
        >>> print browser.contents
        
        Apply the patches.
        
        >>> from Products.Five import zcml
        >>> from Products.Five import fiveconfigure
        >>> from collective import testcaselayer
        >>> fiveconfigure.debug_mode = True
        >>> zcml.load_config('configure.zcml', package=testcaselayer)
        >>> fiveconfigure.debug_mode = False
        
        A fresh request should have no referer.
        
        >>> browser.open(folder.index_html.absolute_url())
        >>> print browser.contents
        <html><body>
        <form action="." method="post" id="post"></form>
        <form action="." method="get" id="get"></form>
        <a href=".">link</a>
        </html></body>
        
        Submitting a form via post should have no referer.
        
        >>> browser.getForm('post').submit()
        >>> print browser.contents
        <html><body>
        <form action="." method="post" id="post"></form>
        <form action="." method="get" id="get"></form>
        <a href=".">link</a>
        </html></body>
        
        Submitting a form via get should have no referer.
        
        >>> browser.getForm('get').submit()
        >>> print browser.contents
        <html><body>
        <form action="." method="post" id="post"></form>
        <form action="." method="get" id="get"></form>
        <a href=".">link</a>
        </html></body>
        
        Clicking a link should set the referer.
        
        >>> browser.getLink('link').click()
        >>> print browser.contents
        <html><body>
        http://nohost/test_folder_1_/

        <a href=".">link</a>
        </html></body>
        
        Data streamed to the response is now in the browser contents.

        https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/98437 [rossp]
        
        1.1 - 2009-07-29
        ----------------
        
        * Fix release.  Files were missing due to the setuptools interaction
        with SVN 1.6.
        
        1.0 - 2009-07-29

        * Tested against Plone 3.3rc4
        
        * Add sample code for basic Plone test case layers
        
        * Deprecate zope.testing<3.6 support
        
        * The collective.testcaselayer.ptc module needs to call
        ptc.setupPloneSite() in order to make sure the plone site exists
        
        0.2 - 2008-01-08

        ----------------
        
        * Initial release
        
        
        TODO
        ====
        
        * Add convenience method for loading ZCML. (witsch)
        
        * Factor out collective.testclasslayer.layer
        
        The collective.testclasslayer.layer module doesn't actually have
        anything to do with test cases, but I didn't want to create a separate
        package just for this one bit.  If someone wants to put this in
        zope.testing or some other common testing dependency, that would be
        great.
        
        * Factor unittest.TestCase out of Testing.ZopeTestCase.base.TestCase
        
        It might be appropriate to refactor out the ZTC specific pieces of the
        test cases in the Testing.ZopeTestCase package such that there is a
        common base class that doesn't subclass unittest.TestCase.  With this
        in place we could do away with collective.testcaselayer.testcase and
        have common base classes that could be used either as layers or as
        test cases.
