        What is it?
        ===========
        
        vice.plone.outbound provides Plone with the ability to syndicate web
        feeds (rss, atom, etc). It is configurable by users and extensible by
        developers.
        
        Plone requirement: version 3.1
        
        Features
        ========
        
        vice.plone.outbound gives you outbound syndication for all "out of the
        box" Archetype Content Types (ATCT) and subclasses.  Any folder (including
        the site root) can be configured with any number of feeds.  This can
        be used to provide granular or bulk content feeds in multiple formats.
        
        Any feed can be set as recursive or not.  A recursive feed will
        include all the content at the feeds location as well as any
        sub-folders content and so on.  A non-recursive feed will only
        syndicate the content directly present at the level of the feed.
        
        Auto discover can be set on any feed.  This will enable modern
        aggregators and browsers to "sense" the feeds location by simply
        providing the URL for the feed folder.  NB only one feed per any
        folder (location) should be configured with auto discover on.
        
        Users may also include a "Published URL" on any feed.  This will
        enable site managers to easily route all traffic through services like
        "feedburner", by first registering the local syndicated feed with
        feedburner, and then entering the respective feedburner URL as the
        "Published URL" for the feed.
        
        Enabling or disabling feeds can be done for the whole site (see the
        add-on product configuration for "Syndication (Outbound)" in the Plone
        control panel), on any folder, or each feed itself.
        
        There are global and per folder configuration options for the maximum
        number of items to be syndicated from any respective feed as well.
        The most recent added or modified date is used to sort all feed
        content.
        
        Installation instructions are in INSTALL.txt.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Assuming you have your buildout.cfg in an editor:
        
        1) Put ``vice.plone.outbound`` in your ``eggs = `` section::
        
        eggs =
        vice.plone.outbound
        
        2) Put ``vice.plone.outbound`` in your ``zcml = `` section::
        
        zcml =
        vice.plone.outbound
        
        3) Configure the ``plone.recipe.zope2install`` recipe to use
        ``fake-zope-eggs``.  In your buildout.cfg file, find the
        ``[zope2]`` section, and add ``fake-zope-eggs = true``
        
        [zope2]
        fake-zope-eggs = true
        ...
        
        5) Re-run your buildout::
        
        ./bin/buildout
        
        6) Install from the control panel in plone
        
        7) Configure for use in the ``Add-on Product Configuration`` section
        in the Plone control panel.

        vice.plone.outbound - 1.0rc1 To be released October 12, 2008
        ------------------------------------------------------------
        
        - Removed viewlets and configlet on uninstall.
        [MatthewWilkes]
        
        - Add a doctest to show how to create new adapters for feeds and items.
        [pilz]
        
        - Turn off KSS validation of the feed config grid. Because the name is a
        required attribute, KSS was reporting an error unless name was filled in
        first. Now, the name field will only be checked for presence during
        server round trips. Thanks to Godefroid for the KSS hints!
        Was http://plone.org/products/vice/issues/6
        [pbugni and derek_richardson]
        
        - Use plone.browserlayer to prevent availability of pages and views until
        installation (via GS or quickinstaller). This solves the symptom where,
        when vice eggs were present but installation had not been finished,
        the vice eggs broke the Plone site.
        [derek_richardson]
        
        - Fixed http://plone.org/products/vice/issues/3
        (Autodiscovered feed inserts redundant <html> tag )
        [pbugni]
        
        vice.plone.outbound - 1.0a1 Released April 29, 2008
        ---------------------------------------------------
        
        - Change package name
        [derek_richardson]
        
        - Change to use vice.zope2.outbound
        [derek_richardson]
        
        - Add configlet icon
        [derek_richardson]
        
        - Add autodiscovery viewlet for Plone 3.1
        [derek_richardson]
        
        - Add portlet for feeds
        [tim2p]
        
        - Make published_url hideable on individual feed configs
        [derek_richardson]
        
        - Make recursion hideable on individual feed configs
        [derek_richardson]
        
        plone.app.syndication.oubound - 1.0a3 Released December 19, 2007
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        
        - Add metadata.xml to default GS profile, declaring version 1.
        Importing the profile will cause the global feed settings to be
        reset, so you'll need to reconfigure it through the site settings
        configlet. Hopefully this is the last time that will happen, as the
        new metadata.xml should prevent that in the future.
        [derek_richardson]
        
        - Display standard feed icons next to feed links in viewlet.
        [derek_richardson]
        
        - Store the ID on the FeedConfig annotation, so it cannot change.
        Fix bad ID generation, bug #002.
        [derek_richardson]
        
        - New SyndicationTool that delegates to global FeedConfig utility.
        Issues deprecation warnings when used.

        plone.app.syndication.outbound - 1.0a2 Released October 24, 2007

        [derek_richardson]
        
        - Remove '@@' view marker from feed URLs
        [matthewwilkes]
        
        plone.app.syndication.outbound - 1.0a1 Released October 15, 2007
