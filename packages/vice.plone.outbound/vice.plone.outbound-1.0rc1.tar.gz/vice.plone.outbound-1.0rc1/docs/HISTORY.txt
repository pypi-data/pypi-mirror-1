vice.plone.outbound - 1.0rc1 To be released October 12, 2008
------------------------------------------------------------

    - Removed viewlets and configlet on uninstall.
      [MatthewWilkes]

    - Add a doctest to show how to create new adapters for feeds and items.
      [pilz]

    - Turn off KSS validation of the feed config grid. Because the name is a
      required attribute, KSS was reporting an error unless name was filled in
      first. Now, the name field will only be checked for presence during
      server round trips. Thanks to Godefroid for the KSS hints!
      Was http://plone.org/products/vice/issues/6
      [pbugni and derek_richardson]

    - Use plone.browserlayer to prevent availability of pages and views until
      installation (via GS or quickinstaller). This solves the symptom where,
      when vice eggs were present but installation had not been finished,
      the vice eggs broke the Plone site.
      [derek_richardson]

    - Fixed http://plone.org/products/vice/issues/3
      (Autodiscovered feed inserts redundant <html> tag )
      [pbugni]

vice.plone.outbound - 1.0a1 Released April 29, 2008
---------------------------------------------------

    - Change package name
      [derek_richardson]

    - Change to use vice.zope2.outbound
      [derek_richardson]

    - Add configlet icon
      [derek_richardson]

    - Add autodiscovery viewlet for Plone 3.1
      [derek_richardson]

    - Add portlet for feeds
      [tim2p]

    - Make published_url hideable on individual feed configs
      [derek_richardson]

    - Make recursion hideable on individual feed configs
      [derek_richardson]

plone.app.syndication.oubound - 1.0a3 Released December 19, 2007
----------------------------------------------------------------

    - Add metadata.xml to default GS profile, declaring version 1.
      Importing the profile will cause the global feed settings to be
      reset, so you'll need to reconfigure it through the site settings
      configlet. Hopefully this is the last time that will happen, as the
      new metadata.xml should prevent that in the future.
      [derek_richardson]

    - Display standard feed icons next to feed links in viewlet.
      [derek_richardson]

    - Store the ID on the FeedConfig annotation, so it cannot change.
      Fix bad ID generation, bug #002.
      [derek_richardson]

    - New SyndicationTool that delegates to global FeedConfig utility.
      Issues deprecation warnings when used.
      [matthewwilkes]
