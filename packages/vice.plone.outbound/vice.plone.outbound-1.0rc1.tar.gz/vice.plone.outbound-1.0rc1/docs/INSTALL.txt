Installation
============

Assuming you have your buildout.cfg in an editor:

1) Put ``vice.plone.outbound`` in your ``eggs = `` section::

    eggs =
        vice.plone.outbound

2) Put ``vice.plone.outbound`` in your ``zcml = `` section::

    zcml =
        vice.plone.outbound

3) Configure the ``plone.recipe.zope2install`` recipe to use
   ``fake-zope-eggs``.  In your buildout.cfg file, find the
   ``[zope2]`` section, and add ``fake-zope-eggs = true``
   
   [zope2]
   fake-zope-eggs = true
   ...

5) Re-run your buildout::

   ./bin/buildout

6) Install from the control panel in plone

7) Configure for use in the ``Add-on Product Configuration`` section
   in the Plone control panel.
