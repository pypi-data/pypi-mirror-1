This document talks about the various ways vice.plone.outbound may be
extended.

* Syndicating new feed and item types - new adapters

You can syndicate new feed types by writing new adapters for your feed types.
If you want a content type to be an item, adapt it to IFeedItem; if you want
it to be a feed, adapt it to IFeed. If you look at atct.py in adapters/,
you will see plenty of examples - just do, in your own package, the type of
thing that is done in this package. Also, there is an example of this type
of customization in: 

src/vice.plone.outbound/vice/plone/outbound/tests/adapting_contenttypes.txt

* Modifying attributes of feed and item types - new adapters

You can change the way data is gathered from content types and turned into
feeds and items by writing a new adapter that performs in the way that you
wish and overriding the stock Vice adapter. You can override the stock Vice
adapters by changing the contents of DefaultFeedFormats or providing your own
feed format ovject to replace the default.

* Changing the body of a feed item - page templates

All stock Vice feed items use a page template to render the body of the feed
item. You can customize the bodies, therefore, by plugging in new page 
templates that render the body in the way you prefer.

* Creating new formats - page templates

The formats for Vice (rss1, rss2, atom) are governed by the page templates for
formats that are available. You can add new formats by adding new page 
templates and wiring them up similarly to the stock formats.

* Removing feed types - editing feed formats

If you wish to remove formats that are provided by default with Vice (say, you 
only want users to be able to create Atom feeds), you can do this by changing
DefaultFeedFormats or by providing your own feed format utility.
