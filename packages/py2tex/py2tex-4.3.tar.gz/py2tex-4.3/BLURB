# The py2tex package allows you to typeset Python programs with LaTeX.
# It consists of some Python code to translate Python source to LaTeX
# and a LaTeX style file that contains the necessary definitions.  The
# style file also adds some degree of customizability.
#
# Its primary function is to typeset Python code properly.
# * Keywords bold.
# * Functions slanted.
# * Symbols instead of ASCII kludges for
#   - assignment (=),
#   - relations (==, <=, >=, !=, <>, in, not in, is, is not),
#   - logical operators (not, and, or).
#   [This is optional because some people (e.g., Guido) find the ASCII
#   versions more recognizable.]
# * Strings in typewriter type.  ASCII control characters in strings
#   are handled properly, i.e., they are typeset as escape sequences
#   ('TAB' is typeset as '\t' and 'ESC' is typeset as '\033').  Long
#   strings (delimited by triple quotes) are handled properly too
#   except in comments.
# * Numeric literals are typeset sensibly.
#   - floating point literals in scientific notation
#     (like $1\cdot 10^6$).
#   - octal literals in italic digits.
#   - hexadecimal literals in typewriter type, lower case 'x', upper
#     case digits.
# * Proper indentation (also for continued lines).
# * Proper line breaking (following TeX rules for formulas).
# * Line numbers.
# * Consecutive lines that start with a hash mark (#) right after the
#   indentation are joined in a single `block comment' and typeset as
#   a whole rather than line by line.
#
# It also gives you the full power of TeX in the comments to your code
# if you want.  This not only allows TeX constructs, like formulae, in
# comments, it also allows for formatted scraps of Python code in
# comments.  In (La)TeX mode the hash mark switches between TeX and
# Python mode within comments, like the dollar sign switches between
# TeX and math mode.
#
# If you don't need these features, or if you want to typeset programs
# that were not specifically written to be typeset with py2tex, you
# can leave comments uninterpreted either by running the py2tex script
# with the -v flag, or by inserting magic comments in the source file.
#
# The Python source for this package is of course documented using the
# package itself.  The accompanying LaTeX style file is documented
# using the doc option by Frank Mittelbach.
