\maketitle

\begin{abstract}\noindent
The py2tex package allows you to typeset Python programs with \LaTeX.
It consists of some Python code to translate Python source to \LaTeX\
and a \LaTeX\ style file that contains the necessary definitions.  The
style file also adds some degree of customizability.
