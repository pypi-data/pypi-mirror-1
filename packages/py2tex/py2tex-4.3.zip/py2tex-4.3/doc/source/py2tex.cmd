The py2tex documentstyle option can be used to typeset files
generated by the py2tex script.  Directions on the usage of the
script and the documentstyle option can be found in py2tex.py.
Documentation on the implementation and customization of this
documentstyle can be found in py2tex.doc.

If you would like to change the definition of one or more macros in
this section, you are advised to make a new style file along the
following lines, rather than change this file.

  % mypy.sty
  \string\input{py2tex.sty}
  <new definitions>
  % EOF

Such a derived style file can be used as a document style option
instead of py2tex.
