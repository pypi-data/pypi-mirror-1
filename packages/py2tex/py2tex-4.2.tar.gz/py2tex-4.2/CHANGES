I `fixed' numbers so that they display the type [lLjJ] if present in roman
type, I also made ** a reserved operator so its treated better (not sure if

needed and this lets it work do unitary minuses correctly (mostly anyway).
Finally, and this is the big one, I modified the treatment of doc-strings.
