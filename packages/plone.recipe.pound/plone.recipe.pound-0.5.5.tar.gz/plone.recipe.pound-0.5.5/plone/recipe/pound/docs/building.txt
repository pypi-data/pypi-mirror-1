example usage
=============

We'll start by creating a buildout that uses the recipe::

    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... parts = poundbuild
    ... index = http://pypi.python.org/pypi
    ...
    ... [poundbuild]
    ... recipe = plone.recipe.pound:build
    ... url = http://www.apsis.ch/pound/Pound-2.3.2.tgz
    ... """ )

Running the buildout gives us::

    >>> print system(buildout)
    Installing poundbuild.
    poundbuild: compilation option : --with-owner=... --with-group=...
    poundbuild: Downloading http://www.apsis.ch/pound/Pound-2.3.2.tgz
    poundbuild: Unpacking and configuring
    ...
