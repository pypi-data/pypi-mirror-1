        - poundctl restart need to use the right config file as well [jensens]
        - In term of portability, bash scripts now use env to get their shell.
        - The poundctl script overrides the control binary present in $prefix/sbin.
        So are introduced options to fix that problem: (kiorky)
        
        - A `poundcontrol` script is added to wrap the real poundctl binary.
        - Customize the names of generated scripts.
        To use them, simply add  `poundctl-binary`, `poundrun-binary`,
        `poundcontrol-binary` to your options.

        supported options
        =================
        
        The recipe supports the following options:
        
        url
        URL for an archive containing the Pound sources. Either **url** or
        **svn** has to be specified.
        
        svn
        URL for a subversion repository containing Pound sources. Either **url**
        or **svn** has to be specified.
        
        ssl_dir
        OpenSSL home directory (default: system defined).
        
        t_rsa
        timeout of the RSA ephemeral keys regeneration (default: 300 seconds).
        
        owner
        name of installed binaries owner (default is user that launch buildout).
        
        group
        name of installed binaries group (default is system-dependent)
        
        extra-options
        extra options for compilation
        
        example usage
        =============
        
        We'll start by creating a buildout that uses the recipe::
        
        >>> write('buildout.cfg',
        ... """
        ... [buildout]
        ... parts = poundbuild
        ... index = http://pypi.python.org/pypi
        ...
        ... [poundbuild]
        ... recipe = plone.recipe.pound:build
        ... url = http://www.apsis.ch/pound/Pound-2.3.2.tgz
        ... """ )
        
        Running the buildout gives us::
        
        >>> print system(buildout)
        Installing poundbuild.
        poundbuild: compilation option : --with-owner=... --with-group=...
        poundbuild: Downloading http://www.apsis.ch/pound/Pound-2.3.2.tgz
        poundbuild: Unpacking and configuring
        ...
        
        
        
        Configuring
        ***********
        
        Supported options
        =================
        
        The recipe supports the following options:
        
        daemon - Daemon 0|1
        Have Pound run in the foreground (if 0) or as a daemon (if 1). By default Pound runs as a daemon (detaches itself from the controlling terminal and puts itself in the background). By specifying this option you can force Pound to work like a regular process. Useful for debugging or if you want to use something like daemontools.
        
        log_facility - LogFacility value
        Specify the log facility to use. value (default: daemon) must be one of the symbolic facility names defined in syslog.h. This facility shall be used for logging. Using a - for the facility name causes Pound to log to stdout/stderr.
        
        log_level - LogLevel value
        Specify the logging level: 0 for no logging, 1 (default) for regular logging, 2 for extended logging (show chosen backend server as well), 3 for Apache-like format (Combined Log Format with Virtual Host), 4 (same as 3 but without the virtual host information) and 5 (same as 4 but with information about the Service and BackEnd used). This value can be overridden for specific listeners.
        
        dynscale - DynScale 0|1
        Enable or disable the dynamic rescaling code (default: 0). If enabled Pound will periodically try to modify the back-end priorities in order to equalise the response times from the various back-ends. This value can be overridden for specific services.
        
        alive - Alive value
        Specify how often Pound will check for resurected back-end hosts (default: 30 seconds). In general, it is a good idea to set this as low as possible - it will find resurected hosts faster. However, if you set it too low it will consume resources - so beware.
        
        client - Client value
        Specify for how long Pound will wait for a client request (default: 10 seconds). After this long has passed without the client sending any data Pound will close the connection. Set it higher if your clients time-out on a slow network or over-loaded server, lower if you start getting DOS attacks or run into problems with IE clients. This value can be overridden for specific listeners.
        
        timeout - TimeOut value
        How long should Pound wait for a response from the back-end (in seconds). Default: 15 seconds.
        
        grace - Grace value
        How long should Pound continue to answer existing connections after a receiving and INT or HUP signal (default: 30 seconds). The configured listeners are closed immediately. You can bypass this behaviour by stopping Pound with a TERM or QUIT signal, in which case the program exits without any delay.
        
        balancers - list of listener http with backend
        Set the list of backends, the list by default is
        **name adress:port adress-backend-1:port-backend-1(,priority,timeOut)  adress-backend-2:port-backend-2(,priority,timeOut) ... adress-backend-n:port-backend-n(,priority,timeOut)**
        
        executable - path to pound, required if pound executable is not provided by the build recipe
        
        socket - Set the control socket path.
        
        sticky - if on , add a sticky session configuration (default on, possible value on/off)
        
        sessiontype - Type of the sticky session (default COOKIE)
        
        sessioncookie - Name of the cookie of the stickysession (default __ac)
        
        sessiontimeout - Time out of the sticky session (default 300)
        
        poundctl-binary - Set the init script name
        poundrun-binary - Set the daemon binary name
        poundcontrol-binary - Set the pound controller name  (it wraps the pound's poundctl binary)
        
        Example usage
        =============
        
        We'll start by creating a buildout that uses the recipe::
        
        >>> write('buildout.cfg',
        ... """
        ... [buildout]
        ... parts = configpound
        ...
        ... [configpound]
        ... recipe = plone.recipe.pound:config
        ... executable = /usr/sbin/pound
        ... balancers =
        ...    one  127.0.0.1:80 127.0.0.1:8080 127.0.0.1:8081,1
        ...    two  0.0.0.0:81 127.0.0.1:8082,1,120 127.0.0.1:8083 169.1.1.2:80
        ...
        ... """ )
        
        Running the buildout gives us::
        
        >>> print system(buildout)
        Installing configpound.
