Changelog
=========

1.4 (2009-06-23)
----------------

- Product eggification

- License change to use ZPL 2.1

- overall code modernization


1.3 (2002-12-13)
----------------

- Feature: Allow selection of varying log levels including no
  logging at all. This should put all those at ease who saw 
  alarming ZODB growth on very busy sites that see a lot of 
  redirections.

- Feature: Added interoperability with virtual hosting. The 
  latest versions of Zope seemed to have changed the values that
  get inserted into the PATH_INFO REQUEST-variable if a
  VirtualHostMonster is used. (Tracker item 208)


1.2 (2002-12-05)
----------------

- Feature: Provide data for the Undo tab entries produced by the
  JRedirector

- Feature: Change the internal storage of logging data to be more
  efficient. This change is automatically applied to existing 
  JRedirector instances the first time the log is accessed, either 
  during a redirect or when the administrator looks up the log 
  history in the Zope management interface. This should also fix 
  Tracker issue 197 if it was a real issue (my own testing did 
  not support these conclusions).


1.1 (2002-10-20)
----------------

This is the "Josef Meile Appreciation Release". Virtually 
all suggestions for improvements in this release came from 
Josef.

- Feature: Referrers to faulty URLs are now tracked as well. They
  are listed on the Log tab.

- Feature: Mappings and Log views have been reorganized a little
  to be more obvious about what they show and to avoid having to 
  scroll the browser window sideways if a URL is overly long.

- Feature: All displayed URLs are now clickable and will open in a
  new window. This allows for quickly testing the old and new paths 
  on the Mappings tab as well as the referrers listed on the Log tab.

- Feature: Old paths that are specified with a trailing "/" (slash)
  characters will have it stripped to prevent matches on directory 
  paths failing because most people just don't use trailing slashes 
  when referring to directories.


1.0 (2002-10-12)
----------------

- Feature: Case-insensitive matching of requested paths to redirects
  (first suggested by Josef Meile).

- Feature: Ability to clear the current logs from the ZMI (suggested
  by Josef Meile).

- Feature: Multiple paths can now be redirected to a single new path
  by specifying a "Wildcard Mapping". Wildcard mappings are used for 
  those requested URLs that have not matched any other non-wildcard 
  rule and that are *underneath* the path specified as Old Path when
  setting up the mapping.

- Feature: Added more allowed HTTP response codes and an explanation
  of these codes in README.txt

- Bug: Highlight the correct ZMI tab after submitting anything from 
  the "Mappings" and "Log" tab.

- Bug: Use REQUEST.PATH_INFO instead of REQUEST.URL because 
  PATH_INFO always contains the full path during traversal,
  whereas URL only contains the path up to the currently
  traversed element. This fixes a bug that prevented redirecting
  to a path that had nothing in common with the requested
  path. Thanks to Josef Meile for pointing this out.


1.0beta2 (2002-01-16)
---------------------

- Feature: __call__ is now equivalent to calling the redirect method, 
  making usage even easier. Now you can just activate it like
  this: `redirector_object(REQUEST)`


1.0beta1 (2002-01-16)
---------------------

- First working code version
