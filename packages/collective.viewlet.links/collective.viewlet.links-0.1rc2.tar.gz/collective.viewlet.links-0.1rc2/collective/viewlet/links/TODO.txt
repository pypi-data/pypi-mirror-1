==============================
collective.viewlet.links Todos
==============================

for 0.1.1 release
-----------------

polish the package further


* i18n product

* hide/remove viewlet at uninstall


for 0.2 release
---------------

use a nicer widget instead of the textbox for managing links.
eg: let user enter a url or pick kupu linkable objects on the site.

* use lizz's widget of liz_newform branch in @@manage-links form (lizz-y)

* feature idea: configlet defines if subfolder can define custom links (see first paragraph in `Defining Links in the Configlet` in README)
