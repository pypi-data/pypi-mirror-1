Description: ETSProjectTools provides commands to make it easier for developers
        to work on projects that have a large number of dependencies, such as
        the ETS project itself.  These commands are all predicated on a concept we
        call a "checkout", which is the coherent set of projects and versions that
        are required to satisfy all documented dependencies for the user-requested
        project(s).
        
        ETSProjectTools provides its tools through the 'ets' command, which has many
        sub-commands.
        
        The first set of sub-commands make it easy to create and interact with
        "checkouts" and their contained projects' original source control repositories
        (currently only Subversion is supported).  This is done by providing commands
        like "co" (checkout), "up" (update), "st" (status), and "rev" (revert).  The
        syntax and semantics of these commands are similar to most source control
        systems.  You can specify which repositories the 'ets' command knows about by
        editing the ".ets.cfg" file in your home directory.
        
        The second set of 'ets' sub-commands make it easy to build, develop, or install
        these projects into a Python environment.  This set includes the 'build',
        'develop', and 'install' commands.  These all basically invoke the 'python
        setup.py' command of the same name on all projects within the "checkout".
        
        The last set of 'ets' sub-commands are used to explore the dependencies of
        projects and enhance performance of the tool itself by generating a cache of
        projects within a repository, called a map, so that each client doesn't have
        to crawl a repository on its own.  These sub-commands are: depends, graph,
        pkgurl, and map.
        
        
        Prerequisites
        -------------
        You must install the following libraries before building or installing
        ETSProjectTools:
        
        * `Subversion <http://subversion.tigris.org/>`_ 1.4. Version 1.5 can be used,
        but requires a `patch to setuptools
        <https://svn.enthought.com/enthought/wiki/PatchSetuptools_for_SVN15>`_ if
        using setuptools 0.6c8 or earlier.
        * `setuptools <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools/0.6c8>`_.
