Tools for working with projects that have many dependencies.

ETSProjectTools provides commands to make it easier for developers
to work on projects that have a large number of dependencies, such as
the ETS project itself.  These commands are all predicated on a concept we
call a "checkout", which is the coherent set of projects and versions that
are required to satisfy all documented dependencies for the user-requested
project(s).

ETSProjectTools provides the 'ets' command, which has many sub-commands.

The first set of sub-commands make it easy to create and interact with
"checkouts" and their contained projects' original source control repositories
(currently only Subversion is supported).  This is done by providing commands
like "co" (checkout), "up" (update), "st" (status), and "rev" (revert).  The
syntax and semantics of these commands are similar most source control systems.
You can specify which repositories the 'ets' command knows about by editing
the ".ets.cfg" file in your home directory.

The second set of 'ets' sub-commands make it easy to build, develop, or install
these projects into a python environment.  This set includes the 'build',
'develop', and 'install' commands.  These all basically invoke the 'python
setup.py' command of the same name on all projects within the "checkout".

The last set of 'ets' sub-commands are used to explore the dependencies of
projects and enhance performance of the tool itself by generating a cache of
projects within a repository, called a map, so that each client doesn't have
to examine the repo on its own.  These sub-commands are: depends, graph,
pkgurl, and map.

Prerequisites
-------------
You must install the following libraries before building or installing
ETSProjectTools:

 * `Subversion <http://subversion.tigris.org/>`_ 1.4. Version 1.5 can be used,
   but requires a `patch to setuptools 
   <https://svn.enthought.com/enthought/wiki/PatchSetuptools_for_SVN15>`_ if
   using setuptools 0.6c8 or earlier.
 * `setuptools <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools/0.6c8>`_.
