* Refactor etsdevelop so that it doesn't do a '-N' but instead analyzes the
    checkout dirs to build a dependency graph and then builds them in the best
    order.  This way, users will still get an error is a dependency couldn't
    be located.

* Add a command line option to do full checkouts instead of parsing the
    project directory name.  Or perhaps just default to doing the full
    checkouts now that repository-side project map files exist and are used
    by default.

* Allow command line options to optimize repository scanning.  For example,
   ignore branches, etc.

* Enable retrieval of specific versions and/or dates.

   * The following will work with our current version of SVN, but the developers
     make no guarantee it will continue to work, so we probably shouldn't use
     it but instead figure out the appropriate WebDAV/DeltaV calls.

* Implement etspush
  * Records the current active egg environment for later restoration
  * Push with a name allows recall by name
    * Should it also push onto the history?

* Implment etspop
  * Restores the previous active egg environment by default.
  * Pop with a name restores the named enviornment, leaving it available for
    further recovery by name as well

* Implement etsdel
  * Removes an environment by name record
