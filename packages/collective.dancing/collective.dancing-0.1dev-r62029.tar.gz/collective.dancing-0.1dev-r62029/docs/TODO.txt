High priority
=============

- We want persistent composers where one can edit the template that's
  used for sending out the message. (nouri)

- We need to implement a secure secret hash.  An unsecure hash is
  generated right now in ``collective.dancing.composer``. (nouri)

- Add proper logging support. (nouri)

- Help texts for the management screens. (stonor)

Medium priority
===============

- A catalog for subscriptions, so that the subscriptions admin page
  scales. (nouri)

- A plain text composer plus template.

- The collector needs to be clever about caching results.

- We need to test the queue and see after how many messages it makes
  sense to commit back.  The relevant code is in
  ``collective.singing.message``.

- We need a convenient way of calling each scheduler's ``tick`` and
  the queues' ``dispatch`` methods periodically.

- Make an ISubscription that holds reference to the member id.  This
  would allow us to implement collectors that filter based on
  subscribers' permissions.

- Make the subscription form (``my-subscriptions.html``) more
  configurable, e.g. to group subscriptions.  Also, use permissions on
  channels to check who can subscribe (e.g. Anonymous vs. Members).
