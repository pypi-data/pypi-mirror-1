History

Version 0.3 - unreleased
------------------------

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added capability to embed stylesheets in outgoing mail.  Right now,
  this is a simple text field that can be set on the channel's composer.
  We're now making use of the StoneAgeHTML library to embed styles in
  the individual HTML elements instead of providing styles in the
  ``<head>`` of the HTML document.  This gives us much better support
  with quirky e-mail clients out there.

  In the future, we want to extend this to allow administrators to
  select themes for individual channels by browsing and selecting from a
  list of registered styles.

- Added Czech translation.

- Refactored ``mail.py`` to create ``MIMEMultipart`` based messages.
  This allows us to easily adapt the mail sending process to embed
  images and the like.
  [naro]

- Added a "reference collector".  This allows you to select individual
  portal items to be sent out, as opposed to items collected by a Smart
  Folder or the like.

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Use ``zc.lockfile`` to lock the queue processing (sending out of mail)
  instead of excessively using ``transaction.commit()``, which caused
  massive ZODB bloat when a lot of messages were involved.

- Use ``email.Header`` for message header formatting.  This allows for
  better internationalization in headers of outgoing e-mails.
  [naro]

- In-browser preview now displays what would really be sent out,
  i.e. after collectors and transforms could do their thing.  Before, it
  used to only display the context item as mail.
