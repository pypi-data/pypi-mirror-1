PyICU is a Python extension wrapping IBM's ICU library and wouldn't be
possible without the tireless efforts of the people and open source projects
below.

  - the ICU developers,

  - the Open Source Applications Foundation, for hosting the project

  - Andi Vajda, PyICU project founder and maintainer
  - David Bolen for Python 2.3 and MSVC 6 support and finding a huge memory leak

Thank you all !
