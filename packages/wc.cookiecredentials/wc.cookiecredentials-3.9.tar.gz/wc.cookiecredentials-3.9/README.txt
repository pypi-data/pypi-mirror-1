This package contains a plug-in for Zope 3's Pluggable Authentication
Utility (PAU) that challenges and extracts user credentials based on
browser cookies.  The plug-in originally appeared in the World Cookery
application, the demo application for Philipp von Weitershausen's book
"Web Component Development with Zope 3" (http://worldcookery.com).
