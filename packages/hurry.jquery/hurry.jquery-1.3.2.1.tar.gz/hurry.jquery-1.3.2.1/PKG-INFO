        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages jQuery_ for `hurry.resource`_. It is aware of jQuery's
        structure and different modes (normal, minified).
        
        .. _`hurry.resource`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hurry.resource
        .. _jQuery: http://jquery.com/
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        You can import jQuery from ``hurry.jquery`` and ``.need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page::
        
        from hurry import jquery
        
        .. in your page or widget rendering code, somewhere ..
        
        jquery.need()
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``hurry.resource``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``jquery-build``
        directory in ``hurry.jquery``) are published to some URL.
        
        The package has already been integrated for Grok_ and Zope 3. If you depend
        on the `hurry.zoperesource`_ package in your ``setup.py``, the above example
        should work out of the box. Make sure to depend on the `hurry.zoperesource`_
        package in your ``setup.py``.
        
        .. _`hurry.zoperesource`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hurry.zoperesource
        
        .. _Grok: http://grok.zope.org
        
        Preparing hurry.jquery before release
        =====================================
        
        This section is only relevant to release managers of ``hurry.jquery``.
        
        When releasing ``hurry.jquery``, an extra step should be taken. Follow the
        regular package `release instructions`_, but before egg generation (``python
        setup.py register sdist upload``) first execute ``bin/jqueryprepare <version
        number>``, where version number is the version of the YUI release, such as
        ``1.3.2``. This will download the jQuery library of that version and place it
        in the egg.
