- Fixed AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'split'
  when reinstalling TinyMCE from 1.1rc1 to 1.1rc2: adding the
  customplugins attribute fails as this attribute is not there yet
  (isn't it ironic...).  I cannot reproduce the error in a fresh site,
  but I have seen it in the wild.
