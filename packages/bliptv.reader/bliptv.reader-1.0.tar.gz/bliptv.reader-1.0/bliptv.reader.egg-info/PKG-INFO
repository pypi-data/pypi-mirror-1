Description: **************
        blip.tv Reader
        **************
        
        The goal of this project is to give developers an easy way to access
        data stored on blip.tv, things like episodes, their enclosures and so on.
        It is a wrapper around the blip.tv API and encapsulates the formatting
        and parsing job.

        *****************************
        
        ======================================
        bliptv.reader version 1.0 (2008/07/27)
        ======================================
        
        - initial release
        
        
        Detailed Documentation
        **********************
        
        
        ============
        Installation
        ============
        
        To install it, the best way is to use easy_install:
        
        $ easy_install bliptv.reader
        
        This will download the package and it's dependencies from PyPI.
        If you don't have easy_install installed, you can download it here:
        
        http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall
        
        =====
        Usage
        =====
        
        First you need to import it::
        
        >>> from bliptv.reader import Show
        
        Now you can select a show and initialize it. We take COM.lounge TV as an example
        which can be found at http://comlounge.blip.tv. The showname thus is "comlounge"::
        
        >>> show = Show('comlounge')
        
        We can now select the first page of episodes from it::
        
        >>> page1 = show.episodes.pages[1]
        
        We can also retrieve the next page like that::
        
        >>> page2 = page1.next
        
        And go back to page1 with prev::
        
        >>> page1 = page2.prev
        
        Unfortunately blip.tv does not return the overall amount of episodes so that
        we can only check next and prev if the return None like this::
        
        >>> page1.prev is None
        True
        
        Also note, that the list of episodes is backwards, starting with the most
        recent episode.
        
        Now we can check the episodes in that page (we can only test existance here
        because we don't know the exact names of the episodes as these change all the time)::
        
        >>> episode = page1[0]
        >>> len(episode.title)>0
        True
        
        >>> episode.url.startswith("http://blip.tv/file")
        True
        
        Moreover you can access:
        
        rating
        The rating of the show, e.g. TV-UN
        pureDescription
        A plain text version of the description
        description
        The HTML version of the description
        keywords
        The tags used as a list
        
        
        ==========
        Enclosures
        ==========
        
        One important part of course are the media files of an episode.
        These are stored as a dictionary inside the enclosures attribute of an episode::
        
        >>> enclosures = episode.enclosures
        
        The dict is a filetype => Enclosure structure::
        
        >>> enclosure = enclosures['video/x-flv']
        >>> enclosure.filetype
        'video/x-flv'
        
        >>> enclosure.url.startswith('http://blip.tv/file/get/')
        True
        
        >>> enclosure.filesize>0
        True
        
        >>> enclosure.height>0
        True
        
        >>> enclosure.width>0
        True
