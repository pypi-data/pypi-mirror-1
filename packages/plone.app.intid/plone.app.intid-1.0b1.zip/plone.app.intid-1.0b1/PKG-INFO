Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package provides a Generic Setup extension profile that will
        install an IntId utility in a CMF portal.  Additionally, it registers
        intid handlers for the standard object events on CMF content.  Finally,
        it finds existing CMF content in the portal and registers it with the
        IntId utility.
