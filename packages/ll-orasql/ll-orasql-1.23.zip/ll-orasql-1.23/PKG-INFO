Description: ll-orasql contains utilities for working with ``cx_Oracle``: It allows
        calling Oracle procedures via keyword arguments, it wraps the result of
        fetch calls in a custom dictionary and it contains some utilitiy functions
        and scripts for accessing and copying database metadata.
        
        
        Changes in 1.23 (released 03/25/2008)
        -------------------------------------
        
        *	Calling procedures and functions has been rewritten: ``ll.orasql`` will
        only pass those parameters to the procedure/function that are passed to the
        call (or variables for out parameters). Internally this is handled by
        executing the call as a parameterized query calling the procedure/function
        with named arguments.
        
        *	``FetchRecord`` has been renamed to ``Record`` (and is used for
        the result of procedure and function calls now, which required some internal
        changes to ``FetchRecord``). The former ``Record`` has been renamed
        to ``Args`` as it's only use now is collecting arguments for
        procedure/function calls. (The method ``fromdata`` has been dropped.)
        
        *	The ``__repr__`` output of ``Argument`` objects now shows the
        datatype.
