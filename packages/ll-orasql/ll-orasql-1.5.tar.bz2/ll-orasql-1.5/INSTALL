============
Requirements
============

To use this module you need the following software packages:

 1. Python 2.4;
 2. ll-core (at least 1.0);
 3. cx_Oracle (at least version 4.1).


============
Installation
============

distutils is used for installation, so it's rather simple. Execute the
following command:

    python setup.py install


This will copy orasql.py to the site-packages directory as part of the
ll package. distutils might complain about a missing __init__.py, but
you can ignore this: The package init file is provided by ll-core.

For Windows a binary distribution is provided. To install it, double
click it and follow the instructions.

If you have difficulties installing this software, send a problem
report to Walter Dörwald (walter@livinglogic.de).
