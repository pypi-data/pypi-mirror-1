====================================
Changes in 0.6 (released 06/20/2005)
====================================

  * Two new functions have been added: iterdrop is a generator that
    yields information about how to clear the schema (i.e. drop all
    table, sequences, etc.). itercreate yields information about how to
    recreate a schema.


====================================
Changes in 0.5 (released 06/07/2005)
====================================

  * Date values are now supported as OUT parameters.


======================================
Changes in 0.4.1 (released 03/22/2005)
======================================

  * Added a note about the package init file to the installation
    documentation.


====================================
Changes in 0.4 (released 01/03/2005)
====================================

  * ll.orasql now requires ll-core.
  * Procedures can now be called with string arguments longer that
    32768 characters. In this case the argument will be converted to a
    variable before the call. The procedure argument must be a CLOB in
    this case.
  * Creating Record instances from database data is now done by the
    class method Record.fromdata. This means it's now possible to use
    any other class as long as it provides this method.


====================================
Changes in 0.3 (released 12/09/2004)
====================================

  * ll.orasql requires cx_Oracle 4.1 now.


======================================
Changes in 0.2.1 (released 09/09/2004)
======================================

  * Fixed a regression bug in Proc._calcrealargs as cursors will now
    always return Record objects.


====================================
Changes in 0.2 (released 09/08/2004)
====================================

  * Now generating Record object is done automatically in a subclass of
    cx_Oracle.Cursor. So now it's possible to use ll.orasql as an
    extended cx_Oracle.


====================================
Changes in 0.1 (released 07/15/2004)
====================================

  * Initial release.
