3.7.0 (2009-03-14)
------------------

- Remove ``zope.container`` dependency, as contained principals didn't make any
  sense, since PrincipalRegistry never provided IContainer. Also, zope.container
  pulls a number dependencies, that are not needed for non-persistent principal
  registry (like, ZODB, for example).
  
  Set __name__ and __parent__ by hand to provide some backward-compatibility and
  to save a pointer to registry from principal objects.

- Initial release. This package was splitted from zope.app.security as a part
  of the refactoring process to provide global principal registry without extra
  dependencies.
