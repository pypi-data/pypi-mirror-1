This is an automatically generated Delivery Status Notification.

THIS IS A WARNING MESSAGE ONLY.

YOU DO *NOT* NEED TO RESEND YOUR MESSAGE.

Delivery to the following recipients has been delayed.

       %(rcpt)s

Subject: %(subject)s
Received-SPF: %(spf_result)s

A statistical analysis of your message has classified it as junk mail,
and it has been quarantined.  Eventually, the recipients will review
their quarantined mail and may notice your message.  If your message is
important, please contact them via other means.  You may also try sending
them a simple plain text message.

If you never sent the above message, then your domain, %(sender_domain)s,
was forged - i.e. used without your knowlege or authorization by
someone attempting to steal your mail identity.  This is a very
serious problem, and you need to provide authentication for your
SMTP (email) servers to prevent criminals from forging your
domain.  The simplest step is usually to publish an SPF record
with your Sender Policy.  

For more information, see: http://www.openspf.org

Your mail admin needs to publish a strict SPF record so that I can reject
those forgeries instead of bugging you with them.

If you need further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Kind regards,

postmaster@%(receiver)s
