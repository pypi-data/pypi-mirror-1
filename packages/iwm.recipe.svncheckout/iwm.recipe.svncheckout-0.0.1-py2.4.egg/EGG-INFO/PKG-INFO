Description: *******************
        SVN Checkout Recipe
        *******************
        
        Recipe for doing generic SVN checkouts in a buildout.
        
        Whenever possible, checkout things you need as development eggs before
        running buildout, instead of using this recipe.
        
        The recipe has three options:
        
        url
        The Subversion URL to use as checkout source. For example:
        
        url = http://svn.kmrc.de/projects/devel/bebop
        
        This option is required.
        
        target
        This option is optional (though highly recommended) and designates
        the destination path (relative to the buildout dir) for the checkout.
        If omitted, <parts-dir>/<part-name> is used.
        
        revision
        The revision to check out. This is optional and defaults to "HEAD".
