O/S
===
At the moment fui only supports Gnu/Linux based systems.
It *may* work on others, but it relies on Gnu's 'cp' and 'mv' being installed.

Caution
=======
This is alpha software and I have not tested it nearly enough. Don't go using it on your vital data because it might eat it all up. Certainly give it a go until you get the feel and start to trust it.

Overiew
=======
fui is a simple way to imitate copy/cut paste from the command line.
The basic idea is to have a way to:
1. Select files/directories into a selection set.
2. Remove items from that set.
3. Move to the target folder (either in the current console,
   or another one entirely)
4. Copy/Move that set into the current one.
5. Optionally repeat steps 3 and 4 by 'keeping' the selection.

Sure there are other ways using grep and backticks, but this
is just an alternative.

Use
===
See fui --help

Remove last version first!
==========================
NB: Remove the old version BEFORE you install fui.

You can find the path by:
locate fuimodules

If that does not work, then you must update your locate database:
As root run: locate -u
Go make coffee.Then run the locate command above again.

This will give you a directory something like:
/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/fuimodules

Use your root account to remove that folder:
sudo rm -fr /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/fuimodules

(Be *very* careful what you type!)
You should be good to go now.

How to install
==============
As the root user enter this command:
python setup.py install

On Debian/Ubuntu systems:
sudo python setup.py install

LOCALIZATION TIPS
=================
Make sure your LANG variable is set properly.
To run under a locale, do something like this:
LANG=en_ZA.utf8
./fui --help

You can find your locales by:
locale -a

TRANSLATION TIPS
================
The script is setup to handle it, but needs po/mo files. If anyone sends me 
some then I'll update the tarball.
