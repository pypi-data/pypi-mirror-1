INSTALLATION
============

This library is currently available in 3 flavours :-

- direct checkout from source code repository
- source release packages (tarball and zip file)
- binary install packages (Windows only)

Source Code Repository Access
-----------------------------

Project URL: http://code.google.com/p/netaddr/source/checkout

Details for checking out code are available on the page.

Source Release Packages
-----------------------

Extract the release tarball or zip file or download the latest release from
the source code repository. Windows binary install packages are also 
available.

Once you've extracted the files you have several choices :-

- Automated Install

	Run the setup file in the root directory like this :-

		python setup.py install

	This automatically installs the required files to the lib/site-packages
	directory of the Python distribution you used to run the setup script.

- Manual Install

	Manually copy the netaddr folder to the lib/site-packages directory of 
	your Python distribution.

- Soft Linking

	Add the path of the netaddr folder under the root directory where you 
	extracted the source release tarball or zip file to your PYTHONPATH 
	environment variable.

Binary Install Packages - Windows
---------------------------------

On Windows, it is usually more convenient to use the binary install packages 
but you may want to download a source zip file as well if you want access to 
the API documentation and unit tests.
