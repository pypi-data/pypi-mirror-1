netaddr for Python is a project released under the BSD license to the 
community in early 2008 by :-

	David P. D. Moss <drkjam@gmail.com>.

It is great to see something that started out as merely "itch scratching"
turn into a useful library used by so many others out there.

A very special thanks go out to :-

	James William Pye <jwp@gmail.com>
	Duncan McGreggor <duncan.mcgreggor@gmail.com> 

whose early adoption, encouragement, suggestions and support have helped spur 
on refinements to some early rough edges and helped to make netaddr a much 
better and more user-friendly library.

RPM .spec file and Fedora repository setup :-

Raising bugs and submitting patches :-

	Sebastien Douche <sdouche@gmail.com>

A big THANK YOU for all your support that makes this so worthwhile!
