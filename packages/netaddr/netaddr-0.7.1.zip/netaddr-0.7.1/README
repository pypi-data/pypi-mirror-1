INTRODUCTION
============

A pure Python network address representation and manipulation library.

netaddr provides a Pythonic way to work with :-

- IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and subnets (including CIDR notation)
- MAC (Media Access Control) addresses in multiple presentation formats
- IEEE EUI-64, OUI and IAB identifiers
- a user friendly IP glob-style format

Included are routines for :-

- generating, sorting and summarizing IP addresses
- converting IP addresses and ranges between various different formats
- performing set based operations on groups of IP addresses and subnets
- arbitrary IP address range calculations and conversions
- querying IEEE OUI and IAB organisational information
- querying of IP standards related data from key IANA data sources

For examples please visit the example wiki pages :-

    http://code.google.com/p/netaddr/wiki/NetAddrExamples

Complete API documentation for the latest release is available online :-

    http://packages.python.org/netaddr/

LICENSE
-------

This software is released under the liberal BSD license.

See the LICENSE file for full text and copyright notice.


DEPENDENCIES
------------

Requires Python 2.4 or higher.

Python 3.x is not currently supported but is planned for future releases.


INSTALLATION
------------

See the INSTALL file for details.


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

You can access various levels of documentation to suit your needs :-

- API documentation

The API is fully documented and is automatically generated for each release
using epydoc - http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/. 

It can be found in the docs/api/ directory where you extracted the source 
tarball/zip file or checked out the code. Open the index.html file with 
the HTML browser of your choice.

- Python docstrings

The docstrings contain a lot of detail. See these if you require information
on specific aspects of netaddr's API via an interactive Python interpreter
session or your favourite text editor.

- online wiki

A set of basic HOWTO code samples are available on the code hosting site's
wiki at the following URL :-

    http://code.google.com/p/netaddr/w/list


CHANGE HISTORY
--------------

Please see the CHANGELOG for details.


UNIT TESTS
----------

No code can ever be deemed truly complete or trustworthy without reasonable
unit test coverage. Full coverage for netaddr is the certainly the ultimate
goal. To this end coverage.py by Ned Batchelder is being used from release
0.7.x onwards to help with this. The latest coverage report can be found in
the tests/ subdirectory. Feel free to add tests to help improve coverage ;-)

Wherever possible all changes and new features will be covered with specific
regression tests.

To run the unit tests, go into the netaddr/tests directory and run the 
following using your Python interpreter :-

    python tests/__main__.py

Or if you are partial to setuptools :-

    python setup_egg.py test

Tests are expected to run through without error. If any do fail, *please* help
the project's user base by filing bug reports at the following URL :-
    
    http://code.google.com/p/netaddr/issues/list

*IMPORTANT*

Efforts have been made to ensure this code works equally well on both big and 
little endian architectures. However, the project does not own or have access
to any big endian hardware (e.g. SPARC or PowerPC) for continual regression 
testing. If you happen to work on big endian architectures with Python and wish
to use netaddr *PLEASE* ensure you run the unit tests before you using it in a 
production setting just to make sure everything is functioning as expected.
