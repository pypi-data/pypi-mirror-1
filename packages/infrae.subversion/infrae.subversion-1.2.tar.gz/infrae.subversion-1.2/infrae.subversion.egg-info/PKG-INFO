Description: infrae.subversion
        =================
        
        This zc.buildout recipe will check out a *number* of URLs into its
        parts directory.  It won't remove its parts directory if there are any
        changes in the checkout, so it's safe to work with that checkout for
        development.
        
        This is an example buildout part that uses this recipe::
        
        [development-products]
        recipe = infrae.subversion
        urls =
        https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/PDBDebugMode/trunk PDBDebugMode
        
        This will maintain a working copy of ``PDBDebugMode`` in the
        ``parts/development-products/PDBDebugMode`` directory (*not* in the
        parts directory itself).  Thus, the recipe handles multiple URLs fine.
        
        If you have ``pysvn`` installed on the computer, it will be use. This
        implies better performances.
        
        Update
        ------
        
        By default, when buildout update the part, an ``svn up`` is done for
        each link. However, when a revision number is specified like this::
        
        https://svn.infrae.com/buildout/infrae.subversion/trunk@27829
        
        The SVN link is skipped for update. If you want to prevent update for
        all SVN link of the part even if they do not contain revision number,
        you can add the following option::
        
        ignore_updates = true
        
        Export
        ------
        
        With ``pysvn`` installed, you can specify::
        
        export = true
        
        in your buildout part to get an SVN export instead of an SVN checkout.
        
        Verification
        ------------
        
        By default, your checkout are checked against local modification
        before any uninstallation step. This can take time on large checkouts,
        and you may don't want it in some case (like when used on buildbot for
        instance). To prevent this step, you can use this option::
        
        ignore_verification = true
        
        Exported Variables
        ------------------
        
        If you set::
        
        export_info = true
        
        Two variables will be exported by this recipe:
        
        - ``revisions`` which gives for each URL the corresponding revision
        number,
        
        - ``updated`` which gives a list of URLs which have been updated with
        new code.
        
        Since values to these variables changes each time you run buildout
        (revision number changes), this trigger an uninstall/reinstall of the
        part. We recommand to activate it only if you need it.
        
        Sample
        ------
        
        For an example buildout that uses this recipe, please see the `Silva
        buildout <https://svn.infrae.com/buildout/silva/trunk>`_.
        
        As well, the `doctest file
        <https://svn.infrae.com/buildout/infrae.subversion/trunk/infrae/subversion/tests/IMPL.txt>`_
        can provide more sample.
        
        Latest version
        --------------
        
        The latest version is available in a `Subversion repository
        <https://svn.infrae.com/buildout/infrae.subversion/trunk#egg=infrae.subversion-dev>`_.
        
        
        Changes
        -------
        
        1.2
        ~~~
        
        - Refactor code, performances should be better at uninstall with Py
        implementation.
        
        - Look for the environment variable ``INFRAE_SUBVERSION_IMPL`` to
        select which implementation to use. Possible values are ``PYSVN``
        (default) and ``PY``.
        
        - Uninstall only look at directory which have been created by the
        recipe in the part. Other are just reported.
        
        - Export two new variables, if ``export_info`` is set to true:
        
        ``revisions``
        
        Which is lines formatted::
        
        link current_revision
        
        ``updated``
        
        Which is lines containing updated links.
        
        1.1
        ~~~
        
        - Add the ``ignore_verification`` option.
        
        1.0
        ~~~
