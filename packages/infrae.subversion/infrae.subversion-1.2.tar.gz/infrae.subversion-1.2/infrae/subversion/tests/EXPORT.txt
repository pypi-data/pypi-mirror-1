Test for infrae.subversion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This test suite works for the Native (with pysvn) implementation.

Export
------

The recipe support export feature, in this case, we got an export::

  >>> cd(sample_buildout)
  >>> write('buildout.cfg','''
  ... [buildout]
  ... parts = svnpart
  ...
  ... [svnpart]
  ... recipe = infrae.subversion
  ... export = true
  ... urls = 
  ...    %s/my.testing/trunk my.testing
  ... ''' % repository)

Re-run buildout, and check the output::

  >>> print system(buildout)
  Installing svnpart.
  >>> ls('parts/svnpart')
  d  my.testing
  >>> ls('parts/svnpart/my.testing')
  -  LICENSE
  d  my
  -  setup.py

(There is no ``.svn`` directory in the parts).

If I delete the directory, it's recreated::

  >>> rmdir('parts/svnpart/my.testing')
  >>> print system(buildout)
  Updating svnpart.
