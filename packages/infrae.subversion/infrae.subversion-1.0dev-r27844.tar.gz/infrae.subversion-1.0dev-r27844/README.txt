infrae.subversion
=================

This zc.buildout recipe will check out a *number* of URLs into its
parts directory.  It won't remove its parts directory if there are any
changes in the checkout, so it's safe to work with that checkout for
development.

This is an example buildout part that uses this recipe::

    [development-products]
    recipe = infrae.subversion
    urls = 
        https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/PDBDebugMode/trunk PDBDebugMode

This will maintain a working copy of ``PDBDebugMode`` in the
``parts/development-products/PDBDebugMode`` directory (*not* in the
parts directory itself).  Thus, the recipe handles multiple URLs fine.

If you have ``pysvn`` installed on the computer, it will be use. This
implies better performances.

Update
------

By default, when buildout update the part, an ``svn up`` is done for
each link. However, when a revision number is specified like this::

   https://svn.infrae.com/buildout/infrae.subversion/trunk@27829

The SVN link is skipped for update. If you want to prevent update for
all SVN link of the part even if they do not contain revision number,
you can add the following option::

   ignore_updates = true

Export
------

With ``pysvn`` installed, you can specify::

   export = true

in your buildout part to get an SVN export instead of an SVN checkout.

Sample
------

For an example buildout that uses this recipe, please see the `Silva
buildout <https://svn.infrae.com/buildout/silva/trunk>`_.
