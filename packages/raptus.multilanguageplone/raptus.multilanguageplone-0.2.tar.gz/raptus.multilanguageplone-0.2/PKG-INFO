Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        raptus.multilanguageplone provides a simple way to have internationalization on
        content objects. raptus.multilanguageplone isn't meant to be a fully fledged
        multilanguage tool, like LinguaPlone. Translation is done directly in the
        edit view of a content type and provides a widget to use google's translation
        api to translate the different fields.
        
        Unlike LinguaPlone raptus.multilanguageplone doesn't create an object for each
        translation, it stores the translation on the object itself and therefor doesn't
        support translation workflows and language aware object paths.
