Description: Scheduling WSGI Middleware
        ============================
        
        This package acts as a WSGI scheduling engine, the middleware can be configured
        to request web contexts at given intervals.  A user may then, within their application,
        configure the web contexts to perform scheduled tasks e.g. maintainence.
        
        The middleware for pulse is provided in pulse.middleware:PulseMiddleware and a paste
        filter_app_factory is also provided.
        
        Configuration
        -----------------
        Pulse can be configured in two ways.  The Middleware takes keyword configuration
        arguments when constructed,or alternatively a config dictionary
        allowing it to be configured by paste.
        If using pastes the pulse configuration options take the form of:
        pulse.config.$configoption.
        
        Currently only one configuration option is supported:
        * context - This is the base web context that tasks are sent to,
        tasks are dispatched to /$context/$action, unless action is an absolute
        path.
        
        Tasks
        ------
        Each task defines at an interval and a web context, pulse will request
        the specified web context every interval seconds.
        
        Creating A Task
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        A new task is created by specifying configuration options, each option takes the form:
        pulse.task.$taskname.$option
        
        The following task configuration options are available:
        * interval - The interval between task dispatching.
        * action - The action to dispatch to: see pulse.config.context
        
        Tasks can also be programmatically configured by passing a dictionary of
        <taskname, TaskObject> into  PulseMiddleware's task keyword argument.
        
        Example
        ========
        
        To request the following context '/sessions/cleanup' every 5 minutes, the following
        paste configuration could be used:
        
        pulse.config.context = sessions
        
        pulse.task.cleanup.action = cleanup
        pulse.task.cleanup.interval = 300
