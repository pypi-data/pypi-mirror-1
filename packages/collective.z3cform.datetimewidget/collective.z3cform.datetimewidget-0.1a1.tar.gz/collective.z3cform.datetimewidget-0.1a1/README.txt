Various z3c.form date and datetime widgets
==========================================

Improved datetime widgets for z3c.form

    When the emphasis of the application you are designing is on speed and
    speed alone, then the single field pattern might be your friend. It's
    particularly useful for data entry applications in which the person
    who has to enter the data will have to use the same input form time
    and time again.
