Description: Various z3c.form date and datetime widgets
        ==========================================
        
        Improved datetime widgets for z3c.form
        
        When the emphasis of the application you are designing is on speed and
        speed alone, then the single field pattern might be your friend. It's
        particularly useful for data entry applications in which the person
        who has to enter the data will have to use the same input form time
        and time again.

        0.1a3 (2009-06-05)
        ------------------
        
        * widget was not showing values from request [garbas]
        * ISSUE 1: SOLVED [garbas]
        After some testing I have seen that some validations are missing, therefore
        I get an error when adding values like '99' into the year field:
        "ValueError: year=99 is before 1900; the datetime strftime() methods require
        year >= 1900"
        
        
        0.1a2 (2009-05-28)
        ------------------
        
        * Register the widgets for custom interfaces that we apply to the standard
        datetime fields, to work around a problem with ZCML conflicting with
        z3c.form. [davisagli]
