------------

This is a django application for visual editing your messy tag clouds.
It adds a new section to you 'tagging' admin page. Usually, this page
has address http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/tagging/ or something like that.

Take look at the bottom part of the page. If you have any objects with tags,
then you should see list of tag clouds, available for viewing and editing.
