        =======
        
        CVault uses Keyring to provide a command-line utility to safely store
        and retrieve passwords.
        
        Make sure you have Keyring installed (using "pip install keyring" or
        "apt-get install python-keyring" under debian)
        
        Then install it using pip or the setup.py script::
        
        $ python setup.py install
        
        $ pip install clvault
        
        Once it's installed, you will have two scripts installed in your
        Python scripts folder, you can use to store or retrieve passwords::
        
        $ set_password.py blog
        Set your password:
        Password set.
        $ get_password.py blog
        The password has been copied in your clipboard
        
        set_password takes a service name then prompt you for a password,
        get_password copy the password for a given service in your
        clipboard.
