        CVault uses Keyring to provide a command-line utility to safely store
        and retrieve passwords.
        
        Install it using pip or the setup.py script::
        
        $ python setup.py install
        
        $ pip install clvault
        
        Once it's installed, you will have two scripts installed in your
        Python scripts folder, you can use to store or retrieve passwords::

        Set your password:
        Password set.
        
        $ clvault-get blog
        The password has been copied in your clipboard
        
        *clvault-set* takes a service name then prompt you for a password,
        *clvault-get* copy the password for a given service in your
