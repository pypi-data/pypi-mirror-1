hgview intallation notes
========================


This is still a development version but already useable.

It is very simple to use ``hgview`` from the hg repository::

  hg clone http://www.logilab.org/hg/hgview

  cd <ANY_HG_REPO>
  $PATH_TO_HGVIEW_DIR/bin/hgview

On the other hand, installing ``hgview`` is simply done using usual
``distutils`` script::

  cd $PATH_TO_HGVIEW_DIR
  python setup.py install

You will then be able to run ``hgview`` simply by typing::

  cd <ANY_HG_REPO>
  hgview

Hgview is available in the of Mercurial extensions, you can use it 
directly form the hg command line

  hg hgview

 for that you must add it to the "extensions" section of your .hgrc file

  [extensions]
  hgview=

 you can also specify an absolute path:

  hgview=/path/to/hgview/hgview_ext.py
  
There's already a TODO list of features that I wish to implement in
``TODO.txt``.
