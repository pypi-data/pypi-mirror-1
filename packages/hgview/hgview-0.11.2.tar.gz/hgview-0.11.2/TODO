===========

temporary TODO list::

- manage group of users and save config in ``$HOME/.hgviewrc`` or
  ``$HGDIR/.hgviewrc``.

  - assign a color to each group instead of each user/email.

- diff for merges currently takes only the first parent.

- investigate how to speed up for large repo (ie. linux kernel).

- highlight search string in the lists (revision and file lists).



The 3-way diff algorithm in hgk.

find gca of the parents of the merge revision (uses hg debug-merge-base).

get tree diff (hg debug-diff-tree -r).
