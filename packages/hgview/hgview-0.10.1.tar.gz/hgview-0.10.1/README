hgview intallation notes
========================


This is still a development version but already useable.

It is very simple to use ``hgview`` from the hg repository::

  hg clone http://www.logilab.org/hg/hgview

  cd <ANY_HG_REPO>
  $PATH_TO_HGVIEW_DIR/bin/hgview

On the other hand, installing ``hgview`` is simply done using usual
``distutils`` script::

  cd $PATH_TO_HGVIEW_DIR
  python setup.py install

You will then be able to run ``hgview`` simply by typing::

  cd <ANY_HG_REPO>
  hgview
  
There's already a TODO list of features that I wish to implement in
``TODO.txt``.
