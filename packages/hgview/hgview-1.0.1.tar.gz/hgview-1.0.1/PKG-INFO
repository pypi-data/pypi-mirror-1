Description: 
        Its purpose is to easily navigate in a mercurial repository history. It has been
        written with efficiency in mind when dealing with big repositories
        (it should happily be able to handle the browsing of the Linux kernel
        source code repository).
        
        This is actually a major rework of the Qt version of hgview.
