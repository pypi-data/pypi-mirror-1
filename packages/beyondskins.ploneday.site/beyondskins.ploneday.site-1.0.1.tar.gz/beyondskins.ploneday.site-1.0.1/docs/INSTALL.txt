beyondskins.ploneday.site Installation
======================================

To use this skin, on a buildout based installation:

    1. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``beyondskins.ploneday.site``
       to the list of eggs to install ::

        [buildout]
        ...
        eggs = 
            beyondskins.ploneday.site

    2. Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::

        [instance]
        ...
        zcml = 
            ...
            beyondskins.ploneday.site
    

If another package depends on the beyondskins.ploneday.site egg or 
includes its zcml directly you do not need to specify anything in the 
buildout configuration: buildout will detect this automatically.

After updating the configuration you need to run the ''bin/buildout'',
which will take care of updating your system.

Go to the 'Site Setup' page in the Plone interface and click on the
'Add/Remove Products' link.

Choose the product (check its checkbox) and click the 'Install' button.

Uninstall -- This can be done from the same management screen, but only
if you installed it from the quick installer.

Note: You may have to empty your browser cache to see the effects of the
product installation.
