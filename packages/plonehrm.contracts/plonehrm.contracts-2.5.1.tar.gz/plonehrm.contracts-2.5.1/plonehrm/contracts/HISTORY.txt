  create a new Letter or a new Contract depending on the settings of
  the worklocation. [vincent]

  contract instead of the current contract [vincent]

  used to extend a contract. [vincent]

  pop-up so it displays the type of the object and its title. [vincent]

2.1.2 (2009-07-29)
------------------

- Updated contracts viewlet to update/hide status message when
  performing actions. [vincent]

- Updated translations [jladage]

2.1.1 (2009-07-22)
------------------

- Now the default date when adding a contract is end date of the
  previous contract plus one day. [mark+vincent]

- Contracts and letter now use 'Template' objects as templates and do
  not take into account simple pages. When creating a contract, only
  Template for which the type is set to contract appears. The same
  principle is aplied to letter. [vincent]


2.1.0 (2009-07-07)
------------------

- We take the title of the chosen template usually when creating a
  contract or change letter, but now we allow to override this again
  by specifically filling in a title.
  [maurits+markvl]


2.0.9 (2009-06-23)
------------------

- Added KSS in the viewlet. Now, it is possible to add contracts and
  letters form the viewlet. It is also possible to set a start date for
  the employee from this viewlet. A new pop-up has been created to
  display the contract. [vincent]
  
- Updated translations [jladage]


2.0.8 (2009-06-15)
------------------

- Fixed error when removing contracts as this triggered a wrong kss
  action.
  [maurits]

- Catch AttributeErrors and KeyErrors thrown by brain.getObject().
  [maurits]


2.0.7 (2009-06-02)
------------------

- Removed the setting of the viewlets in the plonehrm_properties to
  the setuphandlers in Products.plonehrm, where we only set the order
  once.  [maurits+markvl]


2.0.6 (2009-05-29)
------------------

- Fixed error when substituting with a template that is not in the
  first portal_contracts tool.  [maurits]


2.0.5 (2009-05-29)
------------------

- Fixed error where the default value of days per week was a string
  instead of an integer.
  [maurits]


2.0.4 (2009-05-29)
------------------

- Added expiry_date method to Contract.  [maurits]

- Add field to store the number of day per week the employee
  works. [mike + mark]


2.0.3 (2009-05-28)
------------------

- Added a listTemplates method to the ContractTool, which lists the
  templates in this tool.  Optionally this lists the templates from a
  higher level portal_contracts tool as well.  This is done by trying
  to call getUseHigherLevelTool on the current tool.  This method
  is not available by default, but can be implemented by third party
  products.  Default is False.  If you always want this to be True,
  add a python script getUseHigherLevelTool in the
  portal_skins/custom folder that just returns True.
  [maurits]

- The ContractTool is no longer a unique object, which means you can
  add this tool for example inside a WorkLocation (from the ZMI or
  with some custom python code) so you can have contract templates
  specific for this WorkLocation.  [maurits]

- ContractTool: really make sure the tool is not indexed.
  [maurits]


2.0.2 (2009-05-26)
------------------

- The contract's title does not anymore appear in the contract
  view. This is done in order to simplify contracts
  printing. [vincent]

- Moved the template field of Contracts to the top of the schema.
  Moved the setTemplate method into a new event handler that is called
  when the Contract (or Letter) is initialized.  And refactored the
  doctests.  [maurits+vincent]


2.0.1 (2009-05-15)
------------------

- Made the title field of Contracts and Letters invisible on the edit
  form.  Instead we take the title of the chosen template and append
  1, 2, 3, etc.  [maurits+vincent]

- Added a link from the contract page to the employee.
  [maurits+vincent]

- cut and pasted the default methods from letter.py to contract.py
  in content, and the base_contracts method.[maurits+mike]

- When creating a Letter, use the hours and employmentType from the
  current contract.  [maurits+mike]

- Added string property 'currency', with default value '&euro;'.  This
  is put in the contract viewlet before the wage.  [maurits]

- Override Contract.getWage() so it returns the wage with a comma
  instead of a dot depending on the default language of the portal.
  Currently we do this only for Dutch, German and French, as we know
  those languages want a comma here.  There must be some other way.
  [maurits]

- Add remove icon (and link) to delete contracts and letters in the
  viewlet itself. [vincent + mark]

- Allow using a comma in the wage.  Added a isCurrency validator for
  that (mostly taken from isDecimal).  [maurits]

- Removed .mo files from locales.  This means those translations will
  not be visible in the old Plone 3.0.  [maurits]


2.0 (2009-04-16)
----------------

- Use collective.autopermission to register permissions.
  [maurits]

- Set end-of-line style as native and set svn:ignore.  [maurits]


1.0 (2008-10-02)
----------------

- Do not do the hrm notification checks when the checks have been
  switched off in our control panel.  [maurits]

- Using hrm_properties to get the notification warning period.
  [maurits]

- Using group icon for control panel.  [maurits]

- Using new function get_employees_for_checking to get on ly the
  active Employees.  [maurits]
