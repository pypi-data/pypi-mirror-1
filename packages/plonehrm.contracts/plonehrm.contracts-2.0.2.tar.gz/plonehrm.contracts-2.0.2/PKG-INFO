        History of plonehrm.contracts
        =============================
        
        
        2.0.2 (2009-05-26)
        ------------------
        
        - The contract's title does not anymore appear in the contract
        view. This is done in order to simplify contracts
        printing. [vincent]
        
        - Moved the template field of Contracts to the top of the schema.
        Moved the setTemplate method into a new event handler that is called
        when the Contract (or Letter) is initialized.  And refactored the
        doctests.  [maurits+vincent]
        
        
        2.0.1 (2009-05-15)
        ------------------
        
        - Made the title field of Contracts and Letters invisible on the edit
        form.  Instead we take the title of the chosen template and append
        1, 2, 3, etc.  [maurits+vincent]
        
        - Added a link from the contract page to the employee.
        [maurits+vincent]
        
        - cut and pasted the default methods from letter.py to contract.py
        in content, and the base_contracts method.[maurits+mike]
        
        - When creating a Letter, use the hours and employmentType from the
        current contract.  [maurits+mike]
        
        - Added string property 'currency', with default value '&euro;'.  This
        is put in the contract viewlet before the wage.  [maurits]
        
        - Override Contract.getWage() so it returns the wage with a comma
        instead of a dot depending on the default language of the portal.
        Currently we do this only for Dutch, German and French, as we know
        those languages want a comma here.  There must be some other way.
        [maurits]
        
        - Add remove icon (and link) to delete contracts and letters in the
        viewlet itself. [vincent + mark]
        
        - Allow using a comma in the wage.  Added a isCurrency validator for
        that (mostly taken from isDecimal).  [maurits]
        
        - Removed .mo files from locales.  This means those translations will
        not be visible in the old Plone 3.0.  [maurits]
        
        
        2.0 (2009-04-16)
        ----------------
        
        - Use collective.autopermission to register permissions.
        [maurits]
        
        - Set end-of-line style as native and set svn:ignore.  [maurits]
        
        
        1.0 (2008-10-02)
        ----------------
        
        - Do not do the hrm notification checks when the checks have been
        switched off in our control panel.  [maurits]
        
        - Using hrm_properties to get the notification warning period.
        [maurits]
        
        - Using group icon for control panel.  [maurits]
        
        - Using new function get_employees_for_checking to get on ly the
        active Employees.  [maurits]
