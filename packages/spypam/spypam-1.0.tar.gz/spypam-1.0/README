Many PAM modules require you to be root to authenticate.
This is true for the regular ones, the pam_unix.so.

To install (and build if needed): python setup.py install 
To build this module: python setup.py build

Installing can be done in many ways, but using the install command is easiest.

test.py is a sample application that authenticates as the current user and
asks for the password, using getpass.getuser() and getpass.getpass().
It requires spypam.so to be compiled and available in the same directory as
the current python interpreter's or in the PYTHONPATH, just like any other
module has to.

MISC:
	I've tried to follow PEP7 to the most of it, and the code compiles
	without any errors.

	This is a listing of various services and what their requirements are
	(this was tested ON MY OWN system. This may or may not be true for you)

	sshd:
		Normal /etc/passwd check, I use it to do normal auth checking.
	login:
		Tests if the user is allowed to login and has a valid terminal.
	su:
		Tests if the user exists & is allowed to su (in group wheel)
