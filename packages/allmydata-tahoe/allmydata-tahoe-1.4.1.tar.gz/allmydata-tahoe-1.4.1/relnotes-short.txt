We are pleased to announce the release of version 1.4.1 of Tahoe-LAFS.

Tahoe-LAFS is a secure, decentralized, fault-tolerant filesystem.  All of the source code is available under Free Software, Open Source licences.

This filesystem is encrypted and distributed over multiple peers in such a way it continues to function even when some of the peers are unavailable, malfunctioning, or malicious. Users can share files with other users using a simple and flexible access control scheme.

This is the successor to v1.3, which was released February 13, 2008. This is a major new release, adding garbage collection, improved diagnostics and error-reporting, and fixing a critical performance problem when downloading large (many GB) files.

Besides the Tahoe core, a crop of related projects have sprung up, including frontends for Windows and Macintosh, two front-ends written in JavaScript, a Ruby interface, a plugin for duplicity, a plugin for TiddlyWiki, a new backup tool named "GridBackup", CIFS/SMB integration, an iPhone app, and three incomplete frontends for FUSE. See the Related Projects page on the wiki.

Tahoe is the basis of the consumer backup product from Allmydata, Inc. -- http://allmydata.com .

However, we believe that erasure coding, strong encryption, Free/Open Source Software and careful engineering make Tahoe safer than common alternatives, such as RAID, removable drive, tape, "on-line storage" or "Cloud storage" systems.
