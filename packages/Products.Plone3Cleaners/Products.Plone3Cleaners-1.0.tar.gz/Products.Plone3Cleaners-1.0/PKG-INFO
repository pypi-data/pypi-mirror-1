Description: Products.Plone3Cleaners: cleanup after migration from Plone 2.5 to 3
        ====================================================================
        
        This package is a collection of browser views that you might need when
        migrating from Plone 2.5 to Plone 3.  Well, currently just one.  Add
        this package to the eggs of your buildout; no install inside Plone is
        needed.
        
        
        Five local sites
        ----------------
        
        Local sites from Products.Five have changed a lot since the Plone 2.5
        days.  They need migration.  Products.Five offers the manage_site.html
        page; just add this to the url of your local site and click the
        'Migrate to Five.component' button.  You should try that first, but in
        my experience that usually does not work.
        
        Note that a default Plone 2.5 Site does not use localsites, so if you
        have them, then they are from a third party product.  If you see an
        error like this in the logs when looking at your Plone 3 Site you have a
        problem::
        
        2009-06-23 12:30:17 ERROR ZPublisher BeforeTraverse: Error while invoking hook: "__local_site_hook__"
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "/home/maurits/zopes/Zope-2.10.7-final-py2.4/lib/python/ZPublisher/BeforeTraverse.py", line 145, in __call__
        meth(*(container, request, None)[:args])
        AttributeError: __call__
        
        We have two browser views that help in fixing this:
        
        - @@find_local_sites: add this to the url of your Plone Site or of
        your Zope root.  Click the submit button to find all objects with a
        problematic local site hook.  Your zope instance log will have some
        details and the page will display links to the objects that need
        fixing.  The links will point to our second browser view:
        
        - @@update_local_site: add this to the url of an object with an old
        local site hook that needs fixing.  Likely, calling this will give
        that same AttributeError once or twice, but you can ignore that as
        you are about to fix it : click the 'Migrate to Five.component'
        button.
        
        The object that had the old local site hook may need some fixes in the
        python code as well.  Ask the developer of the product that this
        object is from.  Note that a local site hook is not always the right
        solution; and this migration is not always enough.  In a client
        project I got rid of one hook and used a simple attribute instead; a
        second hook worked fine after the above migration; a third hook needed
        a different migration.
