<h1>Boodler: Version History</h1>

<dl>

<dt>2.0.2 (Jan 28, 2009)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Fixed the --default-driver option in setup.py, which broke at some point.
</p>
<p>
ALSA: fixed bug where the last moment of a soundscape would be cut short.
</p>
<p>
MACOSX: fixed bug where the first moment of a soundscape could skip a little.
</p>
<p>
Added a OSXAQ driver (based on code contributed by Aaron Griffith).
This is recommended on MacOSX 10.5 and later. Also compatible with the iPhone.
</p>
<p>
Added a PULSE driver, for the PulseAudio sound system used in (Linux)
Ubuntu 8.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>2.0.1 (Jan 14, 2009)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Fixed trivial bugs that prevented Boodler from working on Python 2.3.5.
(The "generate_pydoc" setup.py command still will not work, but you
don't need to run that; the pydocs are all generated already.)
</p>
</dd>

<dt>2.0.0 (Jan 12, 2009)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Complete redesign of the module system. Soundscapes are now downloaded
and installed as packages (.boop files) from the Boodler web site.
Packages can import other packages, with full versioning capability.
</p>
<p>
The Boodler sound library is divided up into packages. Agents deal with
sounds as Python objects, not pathname strings.
</p>
<p>
You no longer need to mess around with environment variables to run
Boodler.
</p>
<p>
Agents now provide metadata describing themselves and their command-line
arguments. Arguments are parsed into appropriate types and classes
automatically.
</p>
<p>
Many other new features, including channel properties, better channel
events, saner stereo pan logic.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>1.6.1 (Sep 28, 2007)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Added LAME MP3 driver.
</p>
<p>
Changed the license of the cboodle module (but not the rest of Boodler) 
to be usable as either GPL or LGPL. (Satisfies the conditions of LAME,
which is a GPL library.)
</p>
<p>
Fixed setup script to compile OSS correctly on BSD.
</p>
<p>
Updated the ALSA driver to work with the modern Linux API.
(Thanks to Jason McBrayer for testing.)
</p>
</dd>

<dt>1.6.0 (Sep 16, 2007)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Lots of changes...
</p>
<p>
Changed the configure/build system to use a standard Python distutils
script.
</p>
<p>
You can now build Boodler with multiple output drivers, and choose
among them at runtime.
</p>
<p>
Added Shoutcast and Ogg Vorbis drivers (contributed by Aaron Griffith).
Also a stdout driver.
</p>
<p>
MacOSX driver now allows you to choose a particular sound device, if you
have more than one.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>1.5.3 (May 2, 2002)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Improved skip-resistance in MacOSX version, by using a multiple sound
buffers. Added <code>--define buffercount=<em>count</em></code> option,
to control this.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>1.5.2 (Apr 30, 2002)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Added MacOSX support. Tested with Python installed as an OSX framework;
might also work with "Unix-style" Python configuration.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>1.5.0 (Feb 19, 2002)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Added the <code>stereo</code> module, and the ability to create a channel
at a particular stereo position. (No, you still can't <em>change</em> a
channel's stereo position as it plays. That's harder. Sorry.)
</p>
<p>
Added many sounds to the library, and many soundscapes to the effects
directory.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>1.4.0 (Dec 17, 2001)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Added the pwrain and owstorm modules, contributed by Peter and Owen Williams.
</p>
<p>
Added support for Unix domain sockets, as an alternative to network
sockets.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>1.3.0 (Dec 12, 2001)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Added the <code>--integer</code> argument to <code>configure.py</code>.
This uses integer computation in some places instead of floating-point
computation. Possibly useful on very old machines, or very tiny ones
(such as PDAs).
</p>
<p>
Removed some obsolete code from the OSS driver, which was failing on
the Zaurus.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>1.2.0 (Dec 3, 2001)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Added a command-line argument which is passed down to the sound interface
unchanged. This allows interface-specific arguments.
</p>
<p>
Added the FILE interface, which writes raw sound output to a disk file
instead of to the computer's sound hardware.
</p>
<p>
Added some agents to the listen module, which respond to standard 
remote-control button events. (See the serialwatch.py script on the
"Accessories" page of the
<a href="http://boodler.org/boodler-1/">Boodler project 
web site</a>.)
</p>
</dd>

<dt>1.1.0 (Nov 27, 2001)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Added configuration script.
Added support for ALSA and ESD sound interfaces.
</p>
<p>
Fixed bug in OSS interface which caused clicking on machines with only
two kernel sound buffers.
</p>
<p>
Rearranged the event-listening system. Agents must now be of a particular
subclass (EventAgent) in order to be posted to listen for events. The
event triggers an agent.receive(event) method, instead of agent.run().
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Initial release (Nov 22, 2001)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Initial release. Only supports OSS sound driver.
</p>
</dd>
