# If you want to configure the Boodler installation to use a particular
# output driver by default, uncomment the two lines below. 

# [build_scripts]
# default_driver=alsa


# Normally, the setup script automatically determines which drivers
# can be built, by checking your include path for header files.
# However, you can override its decisions with the with-drivers and
# without-drivers options. Uncomment the following lines to use them.
# Each argument must be a driver name, or a comma-separated list of
# driver names.

# [build_ext]
# with-drivers=macosx
# without-drivers=vorbis,shout


# If you are configuring on a platform where floating-point math is
# very expensive, or not available, you may have to uncomment the two
# lines below. The intmath option builds Boodler to use all integer
# math.
#
# If you are configuring Boodler on a desktop PC, leave this option
# alone. Boodler uses floating-point math by default, and that's what
# you want.

# [build_ext]
# intmath=1
