Description: 
        Boodler is a tool for creating soundscapes -- continuous, infinitely
        varying streams of sound. Boodler is designed to run in the background
        on a computer, maintaining whatever sound environment you desire.
        
        Boodler is extensible, customizable, and modular. Each soundscape is a
        small piece of Python code -- typically less than a page. A soundscape
        can incorporate other soundscapes; it can combine other soundscapes,
        switch between them, fade them in and out. This package comes with
        many example soundscapes. You can use these, modify them, combine them
        to arbitrary levels of complexity, or write your own.
