        Introduction
        ============
        
        A buildout recipe that packages and configures the munin tool
        *varnish_* to enable monitoring of Varnish.
        
        Contains a copy of *varnish_* `r4144 <http://varnish.projects.linpro.no/browser/trunk/varnish-tools/munin/varnish_>`__ created by Kristian Lyngstol which
        works with Varnish 2.0 or newer.
        
        
        How to use it
        =============
        
        You can use it with at part like this::
        
        [buildout]
        parts =
        ...
        munin-varnish
        
        [munin-varnish]
        recipe = munin-varnish
        varnishstat = ${varnish-build:location}/bin/varnishstat
        
        Where ``varnish-build`` would be a typical cmmi part that builds
        Varnish. And the ``varnishstat`` option is the full path to the
        *varnishstat* binary.
        
        This part will create a script in the buildout bin directory called
        *munin-varnish* which is used to monitor all the different aspects. The
        current list of aspects available for monitoring is::
        
        expunge
        transfer_rates
        objects
        uptime
        request_rate
        memory_usage
        hit_rate
        threads
        backend_traffic
        
        Each of these need to be installed as symlinks into the munin-node
        plugins. For example::
        
        cd /etc/munin/plugins
        ln -s /path/to/buildout/bin/munin-varnish varnish_expunge
        
        
        Notes
        =====
        
        * A build of *varnishstat* requires the developer's libraries for
        ncurses. If you don't have a *varnsihstat* in your build of Varnish
        then most likely you need to install the ncurses-devel or
        libncurses5-dev package and then get buildout to rebuild Varnish.
        
        * The hit_rate aspect only works correctly with a munin server running
        version 1.4.0 alpha or better. However hit rate data is also
        available in request_rate where it is presented as raw rates rather
        than normalised as a percentage.
