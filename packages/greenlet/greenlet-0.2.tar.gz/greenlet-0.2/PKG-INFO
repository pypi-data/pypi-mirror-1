Description: 
        (This is the py.magic.greenlet module from the py lib
        <http://codespeak.net/py/>)
        
        The "greenlet" package is a spin-off of Stackless, a version of CPython that
        supports micro-threads called "tasklets".  Tasklets run pseudo-concurrently
        (typically in a single or a few OS-level threads) and are synchronized with
        data exchanges on "channels".
        
        A "greenlet", on the other hand, is a still more primitive notion of
        micro-thread with no implicit scheduling; coroutines, in other words.
        This is useful when you want to control exactly when your code runs.
        You can build custom scheduled micro-threads on top of greenlet; however, it
        seems that greenlets are useful on their own as a way to make advanced control
        flow structures.  For example, we can recreate generators; the difference with
        Python's own generators is that our generators can call nested functions and
        the nested functions can yield values too.  Additionally, you don't need a
        "yield" keyword. See the example in test_generator.py.
        
        Greenlets are provided as a C extension module for the regular unmodified
        interpreter.
