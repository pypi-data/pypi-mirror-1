        0.2.3 (2009-12-06)
        ==================
        
        - replaced unicode -> TeX mapping (encodings.py) with a more complete
        mapping as found in docutils.py (unicode_map.py)
        
        0.2.2 (2009-12-04)
        ==================
        
        - IBibliographicReference: added 'identifiers' to schema
        
        
        0.2.1 (2009-08-26)
        ==================

        ==================
        
        - Moved _getCommand/_hasCommand functions relating to bibutils from bibliograph.rendering to bibliograph.core [tim2p].
        - Updated encodings.py so that accented characters are correctly rendered for BibTeX/LaTeX [tim2p].
        - Removed IBibContainerIterator in favour of rolling the functionality into a (new) IBibliography interface [tim2p].
        - Added an (unused, currently) IAuthors interface that I plan to develop into a part of the author handling api [tim2p].
        - Introduced generic vocabulary `bibliography.formats` for IBibliographyExport interface [tom_gross].
        
        0.1.0 (2008-05-02)
        ==================
        
        - Created recipe with ZopeSkel [tom_gross].

        Overview
        --------
        
        Core definitions of bibliograph packages
        
        Here all bits and pieces are defined which are commonly used by the
        packagages sharing the `bibliograph` namespace. We provide some interfaces
        here:
        
        IBibliographicReference is an interface for a single content object with a given
        schema which can be rendered as a bibliographic entry (bibtex, endnote,
        ris, etc.).
        
        >>> from bibliograph.core import interfaces
        >>> 'IBibliographicReference' in dir(interfaces)
        True
        
        IBibliographyExport is a marker for a container directly
        containing single exportable IBibliographicReference objects.
        
        >>> 'IBibliographyExport' in dir(interfaces)
        True
        
        Another part of the package are utility methods and a collection of encodings
        used within python and latex including a mapping.
        
        A utility method `bin_search` is included. It acts like the `which`-command on
        posix systems. It returns the full path of an executeable command, if it is
        found in the PATH environment variable.
        
        You may overload the PATH environment variable with another environment
        variable: BIBUTILS_PATH. Executeables in this location will be found as well.
