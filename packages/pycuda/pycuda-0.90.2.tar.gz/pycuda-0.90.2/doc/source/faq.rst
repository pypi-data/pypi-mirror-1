Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

How about multiple GPUs?
------------------------

Two ways:

* Allocate two contexts, juggle (:meth:`pycuda.driver.Context.push` and
  :meth:`pycuda.driver.Context.pop`) them from that one process.
* Work with several threads. As of Version 0.90.2, PyCuda will actually 
  release the `GIL <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Interpreter_Lock>`_
  while it is waiting for CUDA operations to finish.

My program terminates after a launch failure. Why?
--------------------------------------------------

You're probably seeing something like this::

  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "fail.py", line 32, in <module>
      cuda.memcpy_dtoh(a_doubled, a_gpu)
  RuntimeError: cuMemcpyDtoH failed: launch failed
  terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::runtime_error'
    what():  cuMemFree failed: launch failed
  zsh: abort      python fail.py

What's going on here? First of all, recall that launch failures in 
CUDA are asynchronous. So the actual traceback does not point to
the failed kernel launch, it points to the next CUDA request after
the failed kernel.

Next, as far as I can tell, a CUDA context becomes invalid after a launch
failure, and all following CUDA calls in that context fail. Now, that includes
cleanup (see the :cfunc:`cuMemFree` in the traceback?) that PyCuda tries to perform
automatically. Here, a bit of PyCuda's C++ heritage shows through. While 
performing cleanup, we are processing an exception (the launch failure
reported by :cfunc:`cuMemcpyDtoH`). If another exception occurs during 
exception processing, C++ gives up and aborts the program with a message.

In principle, this could be handled better. If you're willing to dedicate time
to this, I'll likely take your patch.
