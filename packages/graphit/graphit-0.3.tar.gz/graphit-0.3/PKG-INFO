Description: GraphIT ?
        =========
        
        GraphIT is a really simple monitoring solution. Unlike other
        solutions like Cacti, GraphIT is very quick to setup, and very easy
        to use. On the other side, GraphIT is not designed for large monitoring
        tasks, and it targets geeks who want to monitor their server in a simple
        way.
        
        GraphIT is client/server based, uses SQLite as database backend and
        HTTP as transport protocol. It uses REST (Representational State
        Transfer) principle to exchange data between agents and server, and
        between server and frontend. All datas are formated in JSON format.
        
        Agent is a simple HTTP client that supports POST request. A Python
        library is provided to facilitate agents creation in Python.
        
        Frontend is a simple web page with JavaScript that queries GraphIT
        server with Ajax. Charts are rendered with flot JS library.
        
        You can see a running demo at http://burger.tecknet.org/#monitoring .
        
        Setup
        =====
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The installation is *really* simple, you just have to type the following
        command (after installing setuptools package on your distro):
        
        ``easy_install graphit``
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        Configuration is exclusively made with the help of ``graphitd`` command
        parameters. Type ``graphitd --help`` to get a list of available
        parameters.
        
        GraphITize installation
        -----------------------
        
        GraphITize is the JavaScript/HTML frontend of GraphIT. Download the
        latest version of GraphITize from
        http://idevelop.org/p/graphit/downloads/
        Uncompress it on your web server.
        
        Rely on provided index.html to understand how GraphITize works (it's so
        simple !!).
        
        You can host GraphITize on another server than the one hosting
        GraphIT, and even run it on your desktop, without a web server.
        
        GraphIT implements ``JSONP`` and ``OPTIONS`` http method for Ajax Cross domain.
        JSONP is used by default because OPTIONS http method is only implemented
        on recent Firefox and Webkit versions. To use the latter, remove the
        "callback" parameter in your URL when you call ``graphitize()``.
        
        Agent creation
        ==============
        
        Agent Python library is installed with server package
        (see Setup/`Installation`_). To use it, you have to import
        ``GraphItAgent`` in ``graphit.client`` :
        
        >>> from graphit.client import GraphItAgent
        
        Then, you just need to instanciate it :
        
        >>> agent = GraphItAgent('http://my-graphit-server/', login='graphit', passwd='secret')
        
        Finally, to submit monitoring data use add_value method :
        
        >>> agent.add_value(set='df', feed='sda', value=42, unit='%')
        
        It's that easy!
