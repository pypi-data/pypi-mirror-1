[ ] Sort out atom/rss templates: i18n:domain = simplesyndication, but
that doesn't have an i18n dir. Likewise no skin dir, for instance. css
is in fatsyndication. Perhaps add css as a browser resource?
(jensens): I'd keep it in here as flat and simple as possible: no browser 
resource, no zcml, just interfaces and templates. Its perfect that way.
