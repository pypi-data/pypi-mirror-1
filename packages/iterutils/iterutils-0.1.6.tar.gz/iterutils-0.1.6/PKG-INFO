Description: 
        About iterutils
        ===============
        
        These functions have been taken from the recipes_
        in the Python documentation for itertools.
        They were originally written by
        Raymond Hettinger and various other people.
        
        This license_
        applies to the Python documentation.
        
        The idea to collect all of the itertools recipes into
        a module named iterutils is from this post_
        by Alex Martelli.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Because iterutils has been packaged for pypi,
        it can be installed using::
        
        $ pip install iterutils
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        After iterutils has been installed,
        its functions can be imported and used as follows::
        
        >>> import iterutils
        >>> list(iterutils.pairwise('abc'))
        [('a', 'b'), ('b', 'c')]
