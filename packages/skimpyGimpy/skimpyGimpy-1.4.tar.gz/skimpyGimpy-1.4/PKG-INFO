Description: Skimpy is a tool for generating HTML visual, PNG visual,
        and WAVE audio representations for strings which people can
        understand but which web robots and other computer programs
        will have difficulty understanding. Skimpy is an example of
        a Captcha: an acronym for "Completely Automated Public Turing
        test to tell Computers and Humans Apart".
