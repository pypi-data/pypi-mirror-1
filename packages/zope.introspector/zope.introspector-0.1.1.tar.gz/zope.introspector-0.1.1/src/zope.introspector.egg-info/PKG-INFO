        *****************
        
        What is zope.introspector?
        ==========================
        
        `zope.introspector` helps developers to get information about objects
        in their Zope/Python runtime environment.
        
        It provides an easy to use API that enables developers to create
        'object descriptors' for any object and is usable in almost every Zope
        environment, namely Zope 2, Zope 3 and Plone. Although
        `zope.introspector` is mainly tested with Python 2.4, also Python 2.5
        installs should work.
        
        `zope.introspector` is extensible. That means, that you can write your
        own descriptors for certain types of objects or aspects
        thereof. Please see the detailed documentation in
        'src/zope/introspector' to learn more about that.
        
        The package does not provide viewing components. Instead you can use
        packages, that are built on top of `zope.introspector`. These provide
        viewing components, that apply to more specific frameworks like Plone
        or Grok.
        
        Installing zope.introspector
        ============================
        
        `zope.introspector` is provided as an Python egg on cheeseshop and set
        up via `zc.buildout`_
        
        .. _zc.buildout: http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout
        
        You may have setuptools already installed for your system Python. In
        that case, you may need to upgrade it first because buildout requires
        a very recent version::
        
        $ sudo easy_install -U setuptools
        
        If this command fails because easy_install is not available, there is
        a good chance you do not have setuptools available for your system
        Python. If so, there is no problem because setuptools will be
        installed locally by buildout.
        
        Because `zope.introspector` is a developer tool, you normally use it
        by including the package the `setup.py` file of your own
        package. There will most probably a section called `install_requires`
        where you add 'zope.introspector' like this::
        
        ...
        install_requires=['setuptools',
        # Add extra requirements here
        'zope.introspector',
        ...
        ],
        
        In `zc.buildout` based package setups you can 'activate' usage of
        `zope.introspector` afterwards simply by (re)running `bin/buildout`.
