Description: plone.reload
        ============
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        Configuration and code reload without server restarts.
        
        This code is heavily based on the Products.RefreshNG product found at
        http://launchpad.net/refreshng.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        While being logged into the ZMI as a Manager user goto /@@zcml_reload on your
        Zope application root via a browser. If your Zope is configured to listen on
        port 8080 on localhost this is::
        
        http://localhost:8080/@@zcml_reload
        
        You should see a message::
        
        Global ZCML reloaded.
        
        Subsequent reloads of this page will reload all global ZCML from all packages
        and products each time.
        
        If you get a `Resource not found` error, make sure you have loaded this
        packages configure.zcml file and you really use the ZODB application root and
        not a Plone site as the base url.
        
        To reload Python code from the file system goto /@@code_reload. You will
        see a page with the 'Code reloaded:' message and a listing of all the modules
        which were reloaded.
        
        Changelog for plone.reload
        ==========================
        
        (name of developer listed in brackets)
        
        0.4 Released March 1, 2008
        --------------------------
        
        - Made the code reload available as its own @@code_reload view.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Integrated xreload.py from RefreshNG and added a first working version
        of a general manual code reload feature.
        [hannosch]
        
        0.3 Released February 21, 2008
        ------------------------------
        
        - Fixed caching issues by invalidating all ZODB caches. If you have local
        site managers spread across multiple FileStorages this might still not
        work as expected.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Added cleanup for CMFCore and PAS.
        [hannosch]

        0.1 Released January 25, 2008
        -----------------------------
