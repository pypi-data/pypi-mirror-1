Description: plone.reload Package Readme
        ===========================
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        ZCML configuration reload without server restarts.
        
        This code is heavily based on the Products.RefreshNG product found at
        http://launchpad.net/refreshng.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        While being logged into the ZMI as a Manager user goto /@@zcml_reload on your
        Zope application root via a browser. If your Zope is configured to listen on
        port 8080 on localhost this is::
        
        http://localhost:8080/@@zcml_reload
        
        You should see a message::
        
        Global ZCML reloaded.
        
        Subsequent reloads of this page will reload all global ZCML from all packages
        and products each time.
        
        If you get a `Resource not found` error, make sure you have loaded this
        packages configure.zcml file and you really use the ZODB application root and
        not a Plone site as the base url.
