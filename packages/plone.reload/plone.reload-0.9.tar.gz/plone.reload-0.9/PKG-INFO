Description: plone.reload
        ============
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        Configuration and code reload without server restarts.
        
        This code is heavily based on the Products.RefreshNG product found at
        http://launchpad.net/refreshng.
        
        The original xreload.py written by Guido van Rossum can be found at
        http://svn.python.org/projects/sandbox/trunk/xreload/xreload.py
        
        It has some enhancements, but those seem to break more code than do any good
        in a Zope environment with patched in meta classes and monkey patches all over
        the place.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        While being logged into the ZMI as a Manager user goto /@@reload on your
        Zope application root via a browser. If your Zope is configured to listen on
        port 8080 on localhost this is::
        
        http://localhost:8080/@@reload
        
        If you get a `Resource not found` error, make sure you have loaded this
        packages configure.zcml file and you really use the ZODB application root and
        not a Plone site as the base url.
        
        When you press the `Reload Code` button, all modules that have been changed
        since the last time they were loaded are reloaded. You'll get a status message
        telling you which modules have been reloaded.
        
        To reload all ZCML without a restart, press the 'Reload Code and ZCML' button.
        
        The action to perform is determined via a simple query string, so once you
        did a 'Reload Code' once, you can simply reload the browser page to execute
        the action once again.
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.9 (2008-07-23)
        ----------------
        
        - Removed the manual cleanup approach for extra registries populated by ZCML
        parsing. Instead we use the registry of cleanup functions inside
        zope.testing.cleanup to automatically pick up all cleaning functions.
        [hannosch]
        
        0.8 (2008-06-30)
        ----------------
        
        - Wrap the setupFinalLogging method of the Zope2 starter objects to initialize
        our internal modified times registry once after Zope is finished loading.
        This is the closest I could find that resembles a `Zope is finished loading`
        event and should help to remove the double-reload behavior.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Only expose the reload view in Zope 2 development mode.
        [hannosch]
        
        - In case of errors during ZCML reload, restore the original global site
        manager state, instead of leaving it in a broken state. This allows you to
        fix and retry the ZCML reload as many times as you need.

        0.7 (2008-06-17)
        ----------------
        
        - Merged the two distinct views into one called @@reload. Added a somewhat
        nicer UI to it and explain some of the current limitations on that page.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Refactored ZCML loading code a bit. Always do an automatic code reload
        before reloading ZCML.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Removed all blacklisting code.
        [hannosch]
        
        
        0.6 (2008-06-11)
        ----------------
        
        - Disabled blacklist until it can be made configurable. The speedup is hardly
        noticeable anyway, and it can block too much (especially if plone.reload
        is being used in a lib/python style deployment rather than as an egg).

        0.5 (2008-05-24)
        ----------------
        
        - Merged r20 from http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~refreshng-dev/refreshng/dev.
        This fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/refreshng/+bug/175898.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Removed various levels of caching which turned out to be premature and
        caused lots of modules not to be found.
        [hannosch]
        
        
        0.4 (2008-03-01)
        ----------------
        
        - Made the code reload available as its own @@code_reload view.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Integrated xreload.py from RefreshNG and added a first working version of a
        general manual code reload feature.
        [hannosch]
        
        
        0.3 (2008-02-21)
        ----------------
        
        - Fixed caching issues by invalidating all ZODB caches. If you have local site
        managers spread across multiple FileStorages this might still not work as
        expected.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Added cleanup for CMFCore and PAS.
        [hannosch]
        
        
        0.2 (2008-01-25)
        ----------------
        
        - Added compatibility with Zope 2.10 / Plone 3.0.
        [hannosch]
        
        
        0.1 (2008-01-25)
        ----------------
        
        - Initial implementation based heavily on Products.RefreshNG.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Initial package structure.
