Description: plone.reload
        ============
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        Configuration and code reload without server restarts.
        
        This code is heavily based on the Products.RefreshNG product found at
        http://launchpad.net/refreshng.
        
        The original xreload.py written by Guido van Rossum can be found at
        http://svn.python.org/projects/sandbox/trunk/xreload/xreload.py
        
        It has some enhancements, but those seem to break more code than do any good
        in a Zope environment with patched in meta classes and monkey patches all over
        the place.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        While being logged into the ZMI as a Manager user goto /@@zcml_reload on your
        Zope application root via a browser. If your Zope is configured to listen on
        port 8080 on localhost this is::
        
        http://localhost:8080/@@zcml_reload
        
        You should see a message::
        
        Global ZCML reloaded.
        
        Subsequent reloads of this page will reload all global ZCML from all packages
        and products each time.
        
        If you get a `Resource not found` error, make sure you have loaded this
        packages configure.zcml file and you really use the ZODB application root and
        not a Plone site as the base url.
        
        To reload Python code from the file system goto /@@code_reload. You will
        see a page with the 'Code reloaded:' message and a listing of all the modules
        which were reloaded.
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.5 (2008-05-24)
        ----------------
        
        - Merged r20 from http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~refreshng-dev/refreshng/dev.
        This fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/refreshng/+bug/175898.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Removed various levels of caching which turned out to be premature and
        caused lots of modules not to be found.
        [hannosch]
        
        
        0.4 (2008-03-01)
        ----------------
        
        - Made the code reload available as its own @@code_reload view.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Integrated xreload.py from RefreshNG and added a first working version of a
        general manual code reload feature.
        [hannosch]
        
        
        0.3 (2008-02-21)
        ----------------
        
        - Fixed caching issues by invalidating all ZODB caches. If you have local site
        managers spread across multiple FileStorages this might still not work as
        expected.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Added cleanup for CMFCore and PAS.
        [hannosch]
        
        
        0.2 (2008-01-25)
        ----------------
        
        - Added compatibility with Zope 2.10 / Plone 3.0.
        [hannosch]
        
        
        0.1 (2008-01-25)
        ----------------
        
        - Initial implementation based heavily on Products.RefreshNG.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Initial package structure.
