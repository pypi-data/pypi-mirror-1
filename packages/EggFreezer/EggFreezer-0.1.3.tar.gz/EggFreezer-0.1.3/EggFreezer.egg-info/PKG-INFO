Description: EggFreezer creates single-file installers for an EGG distribution along with all requirements
        that can be used without network access.
        
        The result is a .py script which bootstraps a virtualenv and installs the requirements that
        have been "frozen".
        
        Note that currently the installers it creates are platform-dependant, that is, if any of
        the requirements is a platform-dependant egg it will only be installable in the same platform.
        I'm more than happy to accept a patch that overcomes this limitation to support
        "universal" installers :)
