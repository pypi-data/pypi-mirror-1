Description: EggFreezer creates single-file installers for an EGG distribution, along with
        all dependencies, which can be used without network access.
        
        The result is a .py script which bootstraps a virtualenv and installs the
        requirements that have been "frozen".
        
        Multi-platform "universal" installers can be created by adding extra platform
        identifiers with the --platform command-line option. Note that binary eggs
        are not too portable, see http://philikon.wordpress.com/2008/06/26/is-there-a-point-to-distributing-egg-files/
        for more details.
