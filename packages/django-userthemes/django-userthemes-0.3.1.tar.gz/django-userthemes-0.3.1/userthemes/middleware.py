    django-userthemes middleware

    * first, it provides a way to access information about the current user outside 
    requests. Comes from http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/CookBookThreadlocalsAndUser
    * second, it sets an HTTP cookie for the usertheme preference in order to
    limit SQL queries
