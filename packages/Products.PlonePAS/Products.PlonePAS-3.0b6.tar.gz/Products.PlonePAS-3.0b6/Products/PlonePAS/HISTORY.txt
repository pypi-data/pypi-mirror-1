PlonePAS 3.0-beta5 - May 2, 2007

    - Modify the roles plugin to lazily update its roles list from the portal.
      [wichert]

    - Filter duplicate search results.
      [laz, wichert]

    - Add a sort_by option to the search methods to allow sorting of results
      by a property. 
      [laz, wichert]

    - Modify login method for the cookie plugin to perform the credential
      update in the PAS of the user instead of the PAS of the plugin. This
      helps in making sure that users will only authenticate against their
      own user folder, so we get all their roles, properties, etc. correctly.
      [wichert]

    - Update installation logic to use plone.session for cookies
      [wichert]

    - Add pas_info and pas_search browsr views.
      [wichert]

    - Deprecate the PlonePAS PloneTool; its changes have been merged in the
      standard Plone version.
      [wichert]

    - Use getUtility to get the portal object.
      [wichert]

    - Deprecate user and group searching through CMF member and group tools
      in favour of PAS enumeration.
      [wichert]

    - Refactor user searching in the membership tool to use standard PAS
      searches.
      [wichert]

    - Add user enumeration capabilities to the mutable properties plugin.
      [wichert]

    - Add a new automatic group plugin which puts all users in a virtual
      group. This is useful for permissions handling: since it is not
      possible to add roles to users with the Authenticated role a
      virtual group can be used instead.
      [wichert]

    - Added support to import PloneUserFactory and added stub 
      for ZODBMutableProperties. Attention: Latter needs a real
      export and import! At the moment it do not export the 
      propertysheets. This is a TODO. At least with this two 
      additions PlonePAS import runs. Additional I needed to
      hack PluginRegistry and and PluggableAuthService slightly.      
      [jensens]
      
    - Added HISTORY.txt and updated version information.
      [hannosch]


PlonePAS 2.4 - April 15, 2007

    - Optomise the local roles plugin for the common case where
      local_roles is empty
      [dreamcatcher]

    - the plone user was assuming a one to one mapping between property plugin
      and user property sheet, and stripping away additional ones as part of
      the retrieval of ordered sheets, instead, it now stores all
      propertysheets in an ordered dictionary, so this assumption is not needed
      [k_vertigo]

    - More postonly security changes
      [alecm, ramon]


PlonePAS 2.3 - May 30, 2007

    - Use a local postonly decorator so PlonePAS can be used with Plone 
      2.5, 2.5.1 and 2.5.2.
      [wichert]

    - Protect the tools with postonly security modifiers.
      [mj]

    - Update GRUF compatibility functions to use the same security checks
      as GRUF itself uses.
      [mj]

    - Fix migration to handle properties of selection or multiple selection
      types.
      [reinout]

    - Correct creation of groups wich default group managers.
      [dreamcatcher]

    - Fix migration from GRUF sites: also include the member properties in the
      migration.
      [tesdal]

    - Correct the test for creation of groups with the same id as users: search
      for the exact id, not substrings.
      [tesdal]
      
    - Fix bad form action which made it impossible to add a plone user factory
      plugin through the ZMI. Backported from trunk.
      [wichert]
