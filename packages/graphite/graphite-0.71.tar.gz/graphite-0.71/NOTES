but were not part of the installed package.   Also, some
trimming to compensate for bit-rot in piddle.

0.70: Various bug fixes, some driven by pychecker.

0.69: Lots of cleanups and fixes, mostly thanks
to michaelward (sourceforge.org ID).

dot size is specified by the data.   Use bigger dots for
more important data!
Improvements under-the-hood to the properties
mechanism.   Various minor fixes.

0.67:  Uses psyco if available.
It runs substantially faster if psyco exists.
Uses either Numeric Python or numarray.
Some new options for g_multiplot.
A few bug fixes in the libraries.
Working to clean up library code.

0.64: Fixes to dashed line generation code.
Extensions to g_multiplot, so you can use dashed lines there.
Fixes to colored dots.

0.62: Added g_multiplot plotting program,
and code cleanup of the graphite package.

0.60: This is a maintenance release.
It fixes a lot of bugs, fixes the test cases,
and makes it compatible with either
piddle (http://piddle.sourceforge.net )
or sping (http://sping.sourceforge.net) .
