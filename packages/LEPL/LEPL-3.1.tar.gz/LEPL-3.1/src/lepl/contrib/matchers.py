    A substitute `Separator` with different semantics for optional matchers.
    This identifies optional matchers by type (whether they subclass 
    `_BaseSearch`) and then constructs a replacement that adds space only
    when both matchers are used.
    
    See also `SmartSeparator1`, which is more general but less efficient.
