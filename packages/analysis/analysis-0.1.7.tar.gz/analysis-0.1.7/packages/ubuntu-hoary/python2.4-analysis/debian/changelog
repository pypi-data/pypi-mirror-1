analysis (0.1.7-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Introduced undefined values in the processing of
    conditional blocks. Such values admit the possibility
    that certain names may not be defined at run-time and
    may therefore need additional testing in generated
    programs.
  * Introduced "undesirable" values which are recorded so
    that code generators may be aware that some operations
    may not be defined and should cause an error under the
    appropriate conditions at run-time.
  * Overhauled the C output generation, introducing an
    output generator.
  * Improved optimised value propagation and C output
    generation, changing and simplifying various generated
    code details to improve performance.
  * Changed the production of qualified names in
    analysis.namespace.
  * Moved builtins.py into a special lib directory
    accessible to programs under analysis.
  * Rewrote various built-in types in Python, removing
    certain functions and structures from the C runtime
    library.
  * Changed the naming scheme for the builtins module and
    the associated runtime library.
  * Added better argument/parameter matching.
  * Added augmented assignment support.
  * Added short-circuiting to the HTML output generation.
  * Fixed analysis.utils.prompt.
  * Introduced the concept of "special" names in order to
    deal with classes inside functions: special names are
    like globals but are not associated with the module
    namespace.
  * Changed the tools to use CMDsyntax-based options.
  * Moved the definition of special names (True, False,
    None, Undefined) to the AnalysisSession object.
  * Fixed blockage handling, ensuring that blockages cause
    propagation back to the blocking specialisation.
  * Changed the _specialisation annotation to _specialises,
    providing a reference to the specialised function -
    useful for looking up the argument details on
    subsequent occasions.
  * Added filtering of locals according to the operations
    performed on them, along with the raising of exceptions
    or the usage of default values when undesirable (or
    filtered-out) types are detected at run-time.
  * Removed cpu6502 generator and instruction visitor.
