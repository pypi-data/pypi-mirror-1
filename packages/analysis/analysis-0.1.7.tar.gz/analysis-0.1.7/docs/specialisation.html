<h1>Specialisation</h1><p>The process of specialisation is central to
the source code analysis process and refers to the identification of
called functions or methods and the construction of special versions of
such functions or methods for use with particular types of
arguments/parameters. The primary motivation for specialising functions
in this way is to separate out the different ways that functions may be
called; for example:</p><pre>def f(x):<br />    x.something()<br /><br />f(1)<br />f("a")<br />f(obj)</pre><p>Here,
we may treat all invocations of the function f as involving the same
function, along with the internal operation accessing an attribute on
the name x and then calling that attribute as being the same operation
across all invocations. However, if we do this, all we can infer is
that the function f may take an argument which can be an integer, a
string, or whatever the name obj refers to, and that the internal
operation involves the access of an attribute on an object which may be
an integer, a string, or whatever else was passed into the function.</p><p>However,
if we specialise the function according to the type of the supplied
arguments, we may resolve separate kinds of operations that may be
associated with each other in a coherent fashion:</p><pre>def f___1(x):<br />    x.something() # where x is an integer<br /><br />def f___2(x):<br />    x.something() # where x is a string<br /><br />def f___3(x):<br />    x.something() # where x is whatever was passed in<br /><br />f___1(1)<br />f___2("a")<br />f___3(obj)</pre><p>Here,
we manage to separate out each incoming parameter type and thus retain
information about the internal operations in the function without such
information becoming confused or lost.</p></body></html>
