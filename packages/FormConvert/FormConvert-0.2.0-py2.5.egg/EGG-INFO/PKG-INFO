        Changes
        =======
        
        0.2.0
        -----
        
        2009-10-04
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Updated to use the GNU AGPLv3 license.
        * Updated ``MANIFEST.in`` to include tests and docs
        
        2009-08-21
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Added support for ``cgi.FieldStorage()`` query params to
        ``multiDictToDict()``
        * Updated the docs so the tests pass
        
        2009-08-11
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Fixed the un-tested post converters
        * Added ``requireIfPresent()``
        
        2009-08-07
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Major documentation and test effort
        * Moved the ``email`` and ``regex`` modules to StringConvert
        * Added some new converters and removed unnecessary old ones
        
        0.1.2
        -----
        
        2009-03-31

        2009-03-27
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Added a FormDecode converter which strips the ``.x`` and ``.y`` off image
        fields if possible and just removes the whole key if not. Perhaps should log
        a warning?
