      [daftdog]

    - Adapted configlet templates for topics/collections to fix padding and adapted padding in table.listing style
      [daftdog]

    - The changes in templates and styles might have side-effects, hence the jump to 1.1-beta1. The kupu configlet templates
      don't use skins layers, so they can't be overwritten and don't have a padding now, but at least the portalMessages are
      readable now in groups and users panels.
