Description: ==========
        eggchecker
        ==========
        
        This is a small set of command extensions for `setuptools` that allows to run:
        
        - QA tests on your package
        - zope.testing
        
        `qa`: QA tests
        ==============
        
        Runs as long as it has a `setup.py` on the root. It adds a new command
        called `qa`. To run it, go into your package and type::
        
        $ python setup.py qa
        
        At this time it simply runs `pyflakes` over the code.
        
        `ztest`: zope.testing
        =====================
        
        Runs `zope.testing` over the package::
        
        $ python setup.py ztest
