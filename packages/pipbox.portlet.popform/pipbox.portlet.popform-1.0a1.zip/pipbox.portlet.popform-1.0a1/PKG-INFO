Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        popform is an add on to pipbox that enables timed popups of
        PloneFormGen forms.
        
        popform is configured as a portlet. When you add it, you specify
        a PFG form and the time delay (in 1/10th seconds). The form will
        then be shown as an AJAX popup form.
        
        popform sets a cookie with a 1-year expiration, and will not display
        the popup unless the cookie is absent. That prevents it from annoying
        users more than once. popform also checks to see if cookies are enabled;
        the form will not be displayed if cookies aren't enabled. Again, the
        idea is to avoid annoying users.
        
        popform is a very small product that's mainly used to control a bit
        of pipbox functionality. If there are visual display or AJAX problems,
        please file a bug report against pipbox.
