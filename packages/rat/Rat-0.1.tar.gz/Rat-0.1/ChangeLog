    * src/rat/testsensitive.py:
    tests.py was renamed to testsensitive.py
    
    * src/rat/swp.py:
    Storage Widget Persistency module was created, which is basically
    a generalization of gwp, by allowing to plug different backends and
    using the same API for it.
    
    * src/rat/gwp.py:
    Now only the GConfValue exists.
    There's only one function to generate persistency_link's: 
    create_persistency_link
    This was created in favor of data_* functions.
    
    * src/rat/hig.py:
    I generalized SetupFileList into SetupListAlertTemplate.
    Created SetupListAlert, which just shows a list of items, it's only used to
    show the user, it's not expected to be interacted with.
    Save changes was ignoring the 'title' argument and not passing extra 
    arguments.
    There's now a 'list_dialog' function that uses the SetupListAlert.
    
    * setup.py:
    Added classifiers, url, download_url and license.

	* src/rat/gwp.py:
	Corrected the FileChooser problems in the correct way, which means that

	to 'True' when creating it.
	Improved documentation.
	Reworked on bits of gwp.Data.
	Corrected the file_chooser_button.
	Now uses gwp.OutOfSyncError to point possible gwp.Data problems.
