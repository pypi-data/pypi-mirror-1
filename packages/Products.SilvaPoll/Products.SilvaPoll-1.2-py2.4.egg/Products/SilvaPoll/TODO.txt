SilvaPoll ToDo items
====================

  - When a poll is not yet available, the message in the public view should
    include the time.

  - When adding a Poll Service, one must choose whether to use cookies or
    not. However, the service is not editable, which means a manager can't turn
    on or off using cookies. This make it very clunky to test since you must
    delete and add another service, losing all the related data and getting
    errors on existing questions.

  - The public preview doesn't preview the poll, it shows the message that
    the public sees if the poll isn't available yet.
  
Known bugs
----------

  - If a poll is only available in the future, the message talks about the
    results: "The results of the poll will be available on this site from..."

  - If an editor tries to "approve for future" in a container publish screen,
    an AttributeError occurs: 'NoneType' object has no attribute
    'set_question_start_datetime'. Actually this isn't necessary because a poll
    can have a start time, and therefore the status screen doesn't have an
    "approve for future" button, but the error shouldn't happen.
