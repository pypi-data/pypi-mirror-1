        Includes views to display graphs using graphviz.
        
        Includes implementation of a generative algorithm for feedback
        network creation based on:
        
        D. R. White, N. Kejzar, C. Tsallis, J. D. Farmer, and S. D. White.
        "A Generative Model for Feedback Networks."
