Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package helps to create custom portal logo in Plone, using new configlet,
        custom css and images. It allows user to construct logo from multiple items
        such as text or images.
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        This package requires Plone 3.0 or later.
        
        Installing without buildout
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Install this package in either your system path packages or in the lib/python
        directory of your Zope instance. You can do this using either easy_install or
        via the setup.py script.
        
        After installing the package it needs to be registered in your Zope instance.
        This can be done by putting a collective.multilogo-configure.zcml file in the
        etc/package-includes directory with this content::
        
        <include package="collective.multilogo" />
        
        or, alternatively, you can add that line to the configure.zcml in a package or
        Product that is already registered.
        
        Installing with buildout
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If you are using `buildout`_ to manage your instance installing
        collective.multilogo is even simpler. You can install collective.multilogo by
        adding it to the eggs line for your instance::
        
        [instance]
        eggs = collective.multilogo
        zcml = collective.multilogo
        
        The last line tells buildout to generate a zcml snippet that tells Zope
        to configure collective.multilogo.
        
        If another package depends on the collective.multilogo egg or includes its zcml
        directly you do not need to specify anything in the buildout configuration:
        buildout will detect this automatically.
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run the ''bin/buildout'', which
        will take care of updating your system.

        Usage
        =====
        
        For example we want to create custom logo for portal DMS4U from server family:
        "DMS4U | CMS4U | ERP4U | CHAT4U" pointing to particular sites http://dms4u.cz,
        http://cms4u.cz, http://erp4u.cz, http://chat4u.cz etc.
        
        Go to "Site Setup" and open "Multi Logo Settings" configlet listed under
        "Add-on Product Configuration" control panel section.
        
        There you can specify a several options like display order (inline or block),
        logo items separator and define individual parts/items of the logo.
        Additional promo text placed under logo items can be defined also.
        
        In our case set "display inline" to True, as separator we enter "|" and define
        the following logo items::
        
        title=DMS4U
        image=
        link=http://dms4u.cz
        css_class='activeLogo' # to make logo item visually activated
        new_window=False # we want the logo item to act like standard portal logo
        separator='+'
        ...
        title=CMS4U
        image=
        link=http://cms4u.cz
        css_class='inactiveLogo' # to make logo item visually deactivated
        new_window=True
        separator=
        ...
        etc
