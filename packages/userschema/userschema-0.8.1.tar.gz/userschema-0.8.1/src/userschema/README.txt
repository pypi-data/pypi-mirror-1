Using the userschema.schema module
==================================

``userschema`` is a package which allows business users to define Zope3
schemas in formats which may be more familiar than the traditional
abuse-the-Python-class-statement form:

- As comma-separated varaiable-length text (CSV) files, easily exported
  from modern spreadsheet applications.  See ``csv-schema.txt``.

- As HTML forms.  See ``html-form-schema.txt``.

- As an element in a XML document.  See ``etree-schema.txt``.
