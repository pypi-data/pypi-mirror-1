0.2 (2008-05-09)
================

Added some processing state information as attributes of the queue object:

``ICatalogQueue.__len__()``
  Return the number of pending cataloging events.

``ICatalogQueue.lastProcessedTime``
  Time of the last successful processing.

``ICatalogQueue.totalProcessed``
  Total number of cataloging events processed.

A new function, ``zc.catalogqueue.queue.addLengthSupport()``, has been added
to help evolve instances created with ``zc.catalogqueue`` version 0.1.  Old
instances must be evolved to be used with the new version.
