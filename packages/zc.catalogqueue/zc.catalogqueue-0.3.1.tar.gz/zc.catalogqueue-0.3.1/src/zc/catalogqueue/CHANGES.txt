Change History
**************

0.3.1 (2009-10-29)
==================

Fixed a conflict-resolution bug (probably a class of bugs) involving
events existing but unchanged in old and new states and not existing
in committed state due to conflict resolution.


0.3.0 (2008-05-10)
==================

Made the computation of length lazy.

Removed evolution helper function and test, as they are no-longer needed.


0.2.0 (2008-05-09)
==================

Added some processing state information as attributes of the queue object:

``ICatalogQueue.__len__()``
  Return the number of pending cataloging events.

``ICatalogQueue.lastProcessedTime``
  Time of the last successful processing.

``ICatalogQueue.totalProcessed``
  Total number of cataloging events processed.

A new function, ``zc.catalogqueue.queue.addLengthSupport()``, has been added
to help evolve instances created with ``zc.catalogqueue`` version 0.1.  Old
instances must be evolved to be used with the new version.


0.1.0 (2008-04-16)
==================

Initial release
