        ==============
        ------------------
        Release sdist eggs
        ------------------
        
        **jarn.mkrelease** is a no-frills Python egg releaser. It was created to take
        the cumber out of building and distributing Python eggs.
        
        Motivation
        ==========
        
        Here at Jarn, we have switched to zc.buildout and pinned egg versions for
        customer deployments. This means that for every update, we have to make
        proper egg releases of all modified packages.
        
        Turns out it's quite a bit of work to put a new egg on a
        distribution server! After preparing a package for release (update
        version strings, etc.), we typically have to:
        
        1. Check in modified files.
        
        2. Tag the release in Subversion.
        
        3. Package up an egg.
        
        4. Distribute the egg via scp or upload it to an index server.
        
        Now multiply by the number of packages needing a release, and the moment
        of `I gotta script this` approaches at warp 9.
        
        Enter jarn.mkrelease.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        ``mkrelease [options] [svn-url|svn-sandbox]``
        
        Options
        =======
        
        -C
        Do not checkin modified files from the sandbox.
        
        -T
        Do not tag the release in subversion.
        
        -S
        Do not scp the release to dist-location.
        
        -D
        Dry-run; equivalent to ``-CTS``.
        
        -K
        Keep the temporary build directory.
        
        -s
        Sign the release with GnuPG.
        
        -i identity
        The GnuPG identity to sign with.
        
        -d dist-location
        An scp destination specification, or an index server
        configured in ``~/.pypirc``, or an alias name for either.
        This option may be specified more than once.
        
        ``svn-url``
        A URL with protocol svn, svn+ssh, http, https, or file.
        
        ``svn-sandbox``
        A local directory; defaults to the current working directory.
        
        Examples
        ========
        
        Release my.package trunk, using version information from the
        package's ``setup.py``, and distribute it to the default location::
        
        $ mkrelease https://svn.jarn.com/public/my.package/trunk
        
        The same as above, but the URL is taken from the SVN sandbox in ``src/my.package``::
        
        $ mkrelease src/my.package
        
        Release my.package and distribute it via scp to
        ``jarn.com:/var/dist/public``::
        
        $ mkrelease -d jarn.com:/var/dist/public src/my.package
        
        Release my.package and upload it to PyPI::
        
        $ mkrelease -d pypi src/my.package
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        mkrelease reads available index servers from the distutils configuration
        file ``~/.pypirc``. How this file must look is documented elsewhere_.
        
        mkrelease furthermore reads its own configuration files,
        ``/etc/mkrelease`` and ``~/.mkrelease``. Here's an example::
        
        [defaults]
        python = python2.6
        distbase =
        distdefault = public
        
        [aliases]
        public =
        jarn.com:/var/dist/public
        customerA =
        jarn.com:/var/dist/customerA
        world =
        public
        pypi
        
        (Note that ``pypi`` refers to the index server `pypi` as configured in
        ``~/.pypirc``.)
        
        Armed with this configuration we can shorten example 3 to::
        
        $ mkrelease -d public src/my.package
        
        And, because ``public`` is the default location, we can omit ``-d`` entirely::
        
        $ mkrelease src/my.package
        
        .. _elsewhere: http://docs.python.org/distutils/packageindex.html#the-pypirc-file
        
        Working with scp
        ================
        
        The simplest distribution location is a server directory shared through
        Apache. Releasing eggs means scp'ing them to the server::
        
        $ mkrelease -d jarn.com:/var/dist/public src/my.package
        
        We have a distribution point for every project, so customer A does not
        see customer B's releases::
        
        $ mkrelease -d jarn.com:/var/dist/customerB src/my.package
        
        Typing the full destination every time is tedious, even setting up an alias
        for each and every customer is, so we configure distbase instead::
        
        [defaults]
        python = python2.6
        distbase = jarn.com:/var/dist
        distdefault = public
        
        [aliases]
        world =
        public
        pypi
        
        The distbase is prepended if an scp destination does not contain a
        host part. We can now write::
        
        $ mkrelease -d public src/my.package
        $ mkrelease -d customerB src/my.package
        
        Working with index servers
        ==========================
        
        In the Plone world, it is common practice to upload packages to plone.org
        `and` PyPI. For this to work, we first need a ``~/.pypirc`` file::
        
        [distutils]
        index-servers =
        pypi
        ploneorg
        
        [pypi]
        username = fred
        password = secret
        
        [ploneorg]
        repository = http://plone.org/products
        username = fred
        password = secret
        
        We can now type::
        
        $ mkrelease -d ploneorg -d pypi src/my.package
        
        Next, we define an alias in ``~/.mkrelease``::
        
        [defaults]
        python = python2.6
        
        [aliases]
        plone =
        ploneorg
        pypi
        
        Which allows us to write::
        
        $ mkrelease -d plone src/my.package
        
        Releasing a tag
        ===============
        
        Release my.package from an existing tag::
        
        $ mkrelease -T https://svn.jarn.com/public/my.package/tags/1.0
        
        Using GnuPG
        ===========
        
        Release my.package to PyPI and sign the archive with PGP (the ``gpg``
        command must be on the system PATH)::
        
        $ mkrelease -d pypi -s -i fred@bedrock.com src/my.package
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        The following commands must be available on the system PATH:
        
        * svn
        
        * scp
        
        * python2.6 (alternatively, configure the interpeter in ``~/.mkrelease``)
        
        Limitations
        ===========
        
        The release tag can only be made if the package follows the
        standard Subversion repository layout: ``package.name/trunk``,
        ``package.name/branches/xxx``, and ``package.name/tags/xxx``.
        If you have a non-standard repository, you must tag by hand
        and run mkrelease with the ``-T`` option.
