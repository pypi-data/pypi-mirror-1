Description: infrae.buildout
        ===============
        
        Used to run a sub-buildout in a buildout. Example::
        
        [cms]
        recipe = infrae.subversion
        urls = https://svn.infrae.com/buildout/silva/trunk .
        
        [cms-build]
        recipe = infrae.buildout
        path = ${cms:location}
        config = profiles/test-instance.cfg
        merge-bin = True
        
        
        The ``cms`` part fetch buildout files, here from a SVN. You can use
        ``infrae.paster`` to create a buildout tree using a paster template.
        
        The ``cms-build`` part runs buildout on the ``cms`` part:
        
        - The ``path`` option determines which parts to depends on, and which
        path to use. This is important to use the ``${cms:location}``
        because this says to buildout that the ``cms-build`` parts depends
        on the ``cms`` one. This parameter is required.
        
        - The ``config`` option tells which configuration file to use in the
        ``path``. By default it will ``buildout.cfg``, but you can use
        safely ``profiles/something.cfg`` (buildout directory is configured
        to use the ``path`` folder to run himself).
        
        - The ``merge-bin`` option tells if the generated scripts of the
        sub-buildout should end up in the same directory than the current
        one. The default is ``False``.
        
        
        Disclaimer
        ----------
        
        The sub-buildout is run in the main parts directory in this sample. If
        this sub-buildout contains data (in a ``var`` folder for example),
        they will end-up in the same part directory than the sub-buildout
        (useless specific configuration in this one). This implies if you
        update your main buildout and the main parts directory is deleted,
        *your data would be lost*.
