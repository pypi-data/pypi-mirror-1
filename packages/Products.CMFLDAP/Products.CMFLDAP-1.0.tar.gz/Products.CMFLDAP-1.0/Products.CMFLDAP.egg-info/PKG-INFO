        Debugging problems
        ==================
        All log messages are sent to the standard Zope event log 'event.log'. In
        order to see more verbose logging output you need to increase the log level
        in your Zope instance's zope.conf. See the 'eventlog' directive. Setting
        the 'level' key to 'debug' will maximize log output and may help pinpoint
        problems during setup and testing.
        
        LDAP Schema considerations when used with the CMF
        =================================================
        The CMF (and by extension, Plone) expect that every user has an email
        address. In order to make everything work correctly your LDAP user
        records must have a "mail" attribute or similar, and this attribute must
        be set up in the "LDAP Schema" tab of your LDAPUserFolder. When you add the
        email schema item make sure you set the "Map to Name" field to "email".
        
        The attributes that show up on the join form and the personalize view
        are governed by the properties you 'register' using the 'Member Properties'
        tab in the portal_memberdata tool ZMI view, which in turn is sourced from
        the 'LDAP Schema' tab in the LDAPUserFolder ZMI view. Attributes you would
        like to enable for portal members must be set up on the LDAPUserFolder
        'LDAP Schema' tab first, and then registered using the 'Member properties'
        screen in the Member data tool ZMI view.

        Changelog for Products.CMFLDAP
        ==============================
        
        This file contains change information for the CMFLDAP product.
        
        1.0 (2009-02-16)
        ----------------
        
        - Products.CMFLDAP has been factored out of Products.LDAPUserFolder
        in order to streamline the LDAPUserFolder package, and to account
        for the difference in dependencies/versions between the
        LDAPUserFolder package and the CMF pieces.
