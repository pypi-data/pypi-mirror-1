Installation
============
**NOTE**: Do not install the CMFLDAP extensions into a Plone site. They 
are meant for pure CMF sites only and will break Plone. You have been warned!

Products.CMFLDAP is installed as an egg using setuptools[1]. It is still 
possible to install it manually by copying the CMFLDAP folder inside 
Products/ from the egg into your Zope instance Products/ folder. Do not 
forget to restart Zope afterwards, regardless of installation method chosen.

Installing the CMF-related pieces into your CMF site
====================================================
When you create a new CMF Site you can activate CMFLDAP by checking the 
checkbox next to 'LDAP-enabled membership management' after selecting 
'CMF Site' from the Add List dropdown in the ZMI.

To activate CMFLDAP in an existing CMF site you need to visit the 
portal_setup tool at the root of your CMF site from the ZMI. On the 
'Import' tab, select 'LDAP-enabled membership management' in 
'Select Profile or Snapshot' dropdown list. Then click on 'Import all steps' 
at the bottom.

Upgrading from Products.LDAPUserFolder
======================================
If you have CMF portals with LDAP-based membership and member data tools 
installed from the LDAPUserFolder product code, they will continue working.
However, you must manually fix the 'cmfldap' Filesystem Directory View 
inside the 'portal_skins' tool. Visit 'portal_skins' in the ZMI and click
on its 'Content' tab. Then click on 'cmfldap' and visit its 'Properties'
tab. You need to change the value for 'Directory' from::

 Products.LDAPUserFolder:skins/cmfldap

to::

 Products.CMFLDAP:skins/cmfldap

and click the 'Update' button.
