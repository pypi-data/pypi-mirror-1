Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package will provide rudimentary OpenID support for Plone sites that are
        using Remember-based member objects.  It supports creation of a member object
        immediately following an initial successful OpenID authentication, or attaching
        OpenID accounts to existing member objects.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Install the RemOpenId egg into your python environment using buildout, pip,
        or the installer of your choice.  Then add 'topp.remopenid' to your ZCML
        packages (usually by setting the 'zcml' value in the 'instance' section of
        your buildout) and restart Zope.  Install the "TOPP RemOpenId" product into
        your Plone site, and voila.
        
        NOTE: For OpenID support to work, you must allow users to register to your
        site.  To do this visit the Security configlet in the Site Setup and ensure
        that 'Enable self-registration' is checked.
        
        WARNING: When you install this product into a Plone site, it will reconfigure
        your site's PAS folder (i.e. acl_users).  While this isn't usually a problem
        in standard Remember sites, if you've made your own customizations to the PAS
        configuration, installing RemOpenId may cause you to lose them.  Use at your
        own risk, and always back up important data before trying new software.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Once RemOpenId has been installed, OpenID login forms will start to show up on
        your site, just like if you were to install OpenID support into a non-Remember
        Plone site.  When users new to your site successfully authenticate with
        OpenID URLs, they will be presented with a completion form where they can
        enter a username and email address to finalize their site registration.
        
        Additionally, an OpenID Accounts portlet will show up on the member preferences
        edit page for every site member.  This portlet will list any associated OpenID
        URLs, and will provide a simple form for registering new ones.
        
        There is not at this time any way to delete OpenID account associations,
        although if the member object is deleted the OpenID association will be reset
        and future uses of an associated OpenID URL will be treated as unknown users.
