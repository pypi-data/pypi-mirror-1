Description: `Fileinfo` helps you in identifying files with specific values for certain
        attributes in order to search and sort these files and present the results
        in an easily readable tabular fashion.
        
        Using `fileinfo` you can access this information for many files at once
        without opening these files individually with a dedicated application,
        which can be very time consuming.
        
        In order to determine such file attributes, `fileinfo` comes with some
        pre-built plug-ins, for file formats like PDF, MP3, TTF and PY (Python
        source code files). These plug-ins allow you to determine e.g. the number
        of pages or the creator of PDF documents, the artist and title of MP3
        files, the number of glyphs in TTF font files, the number of classes
        or docstrings in Python files, etc.
        
        Of course, you can also access file information on an operating system
        level, like the size and modification date/time of files. And, you can
        also write your own plug-ins to extend `fileinfo`'s capabilities.
        
        A tool like `fileinfo` is different from other tools like `Spotlight
        <http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/spotlight/>`_, since it does not use
        a huge global index and it presents not only a flat result list, but an
        overview of matching files together with the respective (possibly sorted)
        attribute values. And since `fileinfo` is written in pure Python it is
        not tied to a specific plattform.
        
        `Fileinfo` is most useful when used on many files at once, because then
        you get an overview of the attribute values for the entire set of files.
        
        This release fixes a few buglets and implements minor packaging refactorings.

        Examples
        ++++++++
        
        From the system command-line you use `fileinfo` e.g. like this::
        
        $ python fileinfo -a npages *.pdf
        
        Here is an example of some statistics for Python code (taken from the
        top-level of `Docutils <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/>`_ 0.5)::
        
        $ cd docutils-0.5/build/lib/docutils
        $ fileinfo -a lc:nclasses:ndefs:ndocstrs *.py
        lc  nclasses  ndefs  ndocstrs  path

        Here is another example for Mac OS X Widgets::
        
        $ cd /Library/Widgets
        $ fileinfo --format rest-simple -a bundlename:bundleversion *.wdgt
