``grailmud`` is a Python MUD server. A more full advocacy and description is 
in ``doc/whatis.rst``.

Installation
============

To install the package with all the defaults, execute::

    python setup.py install

in the current directory.

``grailmud`` depends on several external packages: setuptools_,  Twisted_, 
durus_, pyparsing_, and functional_. The latter four must be present for 
normal operations; setuptools is only needed for installation.

In addition, docutils_ is used to produce a HTML-ified version of the docs. 
This is not strictly needed; the docs are written in reST which is quite 
readable in plain text, but it may be nice to have. ImageMagick_ and graphviz_
are needed to construct the images in the docs.

Running ``grailmud``
====================

Presumably you'll want to customise the game a little, because there is very 
little in the way of actual game content. However, a very silly, very small
sample MUD is included: first::
    
    create_mudlib.py

to create and initialise the mudlib, and then::

    rungrail.py

to launch the server. It listens on port 6666.

Running the tests
=================

To run ``grailmud``'s unit testing suite, you need the nose_ testing tool. 
With that installed, run::

    nosetests

at the shell in ``grailmud``'s directory.
