Things what have happened
============================

New in grailmud 0.1a3
=====================

* A new action, ``commands``, which lists the commands visible to the player.

* Proper handling of telnet NVT commands (especially backspace).

* Got object serialisation more-or-less working. Well, in a hackish sense.

* 'listeners' have been renamed to 'delegates'.

* A new tool in ``utils.py``, the ``Matcher`` class that abstracts away some of
the fun of ParseExceptions.
