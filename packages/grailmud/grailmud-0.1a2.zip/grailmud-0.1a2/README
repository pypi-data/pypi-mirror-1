``grailmud`` is a Python MUD server. A more full advocacy and description is 
in ``doc/whatis.rst``.

Installation
============

To install the package with all the defaults, execute::

    python setup.py install

in the current directory.

Running ``grailmud``
====================

Presumably you'll want to customise the game a little, because there is very 
little in the way of actual game content. However, a very silly, very small
sample MUD is included: first::
    
    create_mudlib.py

to create and initialise the mudlib, and then::

    rungrail.py

to launch the server. It listens on port 6666.

Running the tests
=================

To run ``grailmud``'s unit testing suite, you need the nose testing tool. With 
that installed, run::

    nosetests

at the shell in ``grailmud``'s directory.
