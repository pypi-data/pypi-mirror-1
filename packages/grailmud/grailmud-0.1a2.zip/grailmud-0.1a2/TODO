====================================
The stuff what does need doing
====================================

For 0.1
=======

* Test ``telnet.py``, ``objects.py``, ``listeners.py`` and ``rooms.py`` as
completely as possible.

* Test ``actiondefs/login.py`` and ``actiondefs/logoff.py`` a bit.

For 0.2
=======

* A proper object relational integrity system, possibly with querying. There is
prior art here; SQLAlchemy, SQLObject, ZCatalog, et al.

Just nice to have
=================

* More documentation. Particularly, tutorials and high-level descriptions might
be nice.
