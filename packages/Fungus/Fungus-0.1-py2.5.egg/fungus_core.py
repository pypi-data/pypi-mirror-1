"""Fungus - Live and die in a world of mold

core functions: 
- scrolling text.

Ideas: 
- maybe replace .blit() everywhere with .draw()
- core: Offer a lightweight sprite and an actor sprite inszead of only the normal sprite to avoid unecessary overhead. The actor sprite contains the functions for keyboard control, the lightweight sprite only has basic movement (dx, dy, x, y).
