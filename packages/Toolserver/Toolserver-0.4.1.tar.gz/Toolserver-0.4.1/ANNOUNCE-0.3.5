The toolserver now is a real daemon and correctly detaches from the terminal.
Other changes include per-tool configuration files, tool initialization and
deinitialization is more fleshed out, XML-RPC behaves more standard in it's
error codes, foreground start now correctly installs signal handlers
and there is a new broadcast notification mechanism that's based on a
Linda implementation internally to TooFPy.
