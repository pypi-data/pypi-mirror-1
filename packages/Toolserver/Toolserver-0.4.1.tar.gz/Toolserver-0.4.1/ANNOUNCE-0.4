Project: toofpy
Version: 0.4.0
Release-Focus: Cleanup
Hide: N

The project got cleaned up, the references to Django (used for having some
integrated web framework) are removed - that feature never worked out right.
Additionally the repository is again available, now on bitbucket. Docs
adapted to the new URLs and email addresses.
