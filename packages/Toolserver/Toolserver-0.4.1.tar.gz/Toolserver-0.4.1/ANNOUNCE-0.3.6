Release-Focus: Major feature enhancements
Hide: N

The main focus of this release was to smooth it out with features. Primary
tasks where better (and extensible) RPC mechanisms, integration of WSGI,
better and more complete authentication mechanisms (optionally RSA
authentication if you install pycrypto) and an IPC mechanism that uses the
same hooks as the RPC mechanisms. Additionally there now is an abstract
client that supports advanced features like deflate encoding.
