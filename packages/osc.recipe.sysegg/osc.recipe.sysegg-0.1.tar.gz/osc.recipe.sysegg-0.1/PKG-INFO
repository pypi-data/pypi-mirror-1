Description: SysEggs
        =======
        
        This buildout recipe allows you to reuse system wide eggs in your buildout.
        If SysEggs finds the requested eggs in you pythons site-packages directory
        (or PYTHONPATH) it will create a ``.egg-link`` to it. Other packages that
        require these eggs will not fetch them.
        
        Example
        -------
        If you have an application that depends on the python image library (PIL) and
        you want to use the library that is already installed (e.g. with apt-get on Debian),
        you can use a buildout.cfg like this::
        
        [buildout]
        
        parts =
        syseggs
        otherpart
        
        [syseggs]
        recipe = osc.recipe.syseggs
        eggs = PIL
        
        [otherpart]
        recipe = zs.recipe.egg
        egg = egg_that_depends_on_PIL
        
        You should list sysegg before all other parts.
