Description: The sphinx document processor generates HTML that uses more advanced syntax
        than the HtmlHelp browser in wxPython and wxWidgets can render.  This program
        uses the htmlhelp files generated by sphinx as input and attempts to remove
        elements that confuse the wxHtmlHelp system while adding or modifying elements
        in an attempt to allow the wxHtmlHelp to render the HTML as closely as
        possible to the HTML as viewed by a modern browser.
        
        This package provides a script ``sphinx-wxoptimize`` that is designed to
        be integrated into your ``make htmlhelp`` target that will automatically
        reprocess the sphinx-generated htmlhelp files and convert them to be better
        rendered in the wxPython or wxWidgets wxHtmlHelpController.
        
        Automatic Integration with Sphinx
        =================================
        
        In your sphinx Makefile, change the htmlhelp target from::
        
        htmlhelp:
        $(SPHINXBUILD) -b htmlhelp $(ALLSPHINXOPTS) $(BUILDDIR)/htmlhelp
        
        to::
        
        htmlhelp:
        $(SPHINXBUILD) -b htmlhelp $(ALLSPHINXOPTS) $(BUILDDIR)/htmlhelp
        sphinx-wxoptimize $(BUILDDIR)/htmlhelp
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Installation is through the usual python packaging commands, either by
        downloading the source archive and installing manually::
        
        python setup.py install
        
        or using easy_install::
        
        easy_install sphinx-wxoptimize
        
        Using easy_install will automatically install the prerequisite BeautifulSoup__
        library.

        ChangeLog
        =========
        
        1.1
        ---
        
        * Now removes unnecessary CSS and JavaScript files from _static directory to
        reduce the size of the distributed HtmlHelp.  The wxHtmlHelpController can't
        use the CSS and JavaScript anyway, so there's no need to include it.
        
        1.0
        ---
        
        * Initial release
