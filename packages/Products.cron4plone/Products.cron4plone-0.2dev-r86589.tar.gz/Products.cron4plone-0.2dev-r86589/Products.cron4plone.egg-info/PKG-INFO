Description: Product description
        ===================
        Cron4Plone can do scheduled tasks in Plone, in a syntax very like \*NIX
        systems' cron daemon. It plugs into Zope's ClockServer machinery.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        1. Configure the ticker in the buildout (or zope.conf)::
        
        [instance]
        ...
        eggs =
        ...
        Products.ClockServer
        zope-conf-additional =
        <clock-server>
        method /<your-plone-site>/@@cron-tick
        period 60
        </clock-server>
        
        2. Configure the scheduled tasks
        
        In the Plone site setup, go to the cron4plone configuration. This form can
        be used to enter cron-like jobs.
        
        The cron job should have 5 elements: minute, hour, day_of_month, month and
        command expression. For the command python and tal expression can be used.
        
        definition: m h dom m command
        
        Examples:
        * 11 * * portal/@@run_me
        15,30 * * * python: portal.my_tool.runThis()
        
        
        3. Wait and see
        
        In the ZMI, go to the CronTool. If a cronjob has run the history is shown.
        
        Rationale
        =========
        Cron4plone uses the clockserver and allows advanced taask scheduling:
        
        - scheduled tasks at scheduled times. E.g. I want to perform a certain task at 3 AM at the first day of the month.
        - single thread running the task: We don't want 2 threads running the same task at the same time. With only using clock server this might happen if a task takes longer than the tick period.
        
        
        TODO
        ====
        - Day of week is missing in cron-like syntax, add it.
        - Improve doc test, currently test has basic coverage.
        - Perhaps make a configuration form that allows users without cron syntax
        knowledge to enter jobs.
