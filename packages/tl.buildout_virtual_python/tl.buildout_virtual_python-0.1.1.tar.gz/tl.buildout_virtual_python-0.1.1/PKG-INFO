Description: ==========================
        tl.buildout_virtual_python
        ==========================
        
        
        This is a `zc.buildout`_ recipe for setting up a virtual Python installation
        inside a buildout. This gives you a writable Python environment isolated from
        other buildouts and from its parent Python installation.
        
        Using a virtual Python avoids the need to compile Python from source and
        allows you to use packages installed into the parent Python installation.
        Depending on your situation, these features may be considered helpful or
        harmful. The recipe provides mechanism and leaves choosing policy up to you.
        
        The idea and implementation of the virtual Python recipe are based on the
        ``virtual-python.py`` script advertised on Phillip J. Eby's `EasyInstall
        page`_, which is in turn based on a script by Ian Bicking.
        
        This recipe appears to be reliable, but the feature set is basically
        determined by the author's immediate needs. Don't hesitate to send questions,
        bug reports, suggestions, or patches to <thomas@thomas-lotze.de>.
        
        
        Options
        =======
        
        A buildout part created by this recipe exports an ``executable`` option so it
        may be used as a part defining a Python installation in a buildout, i.e. a
        ``buildout`` section's ``python`` option may reference it.
        
        Configuration options:
        :executable-name:
        Basename of the virtual Python installation's interpreter executable.
        
        :real-python:
        Filesystem path to the interpreter executable of the Python
        installation that should be used as the parent Python.
        
        :site-packages:
        Boolean switch, whether to make the parent Python's ``site-packages``
        library directory available to the virtual Python.
        
        :extra-paths:
        Extra library paths to make available to the virtual Python.
        
        :headers:
        Boolean switch, whether to make the parent Python's C header files
        available in the virtual Python installation.
        
        Exported options:
        :location:
        Location of the buildout part containing the virtual Python
        installation. This is the same as the virtual Python's ``sys.prefix``.
        
        :executable:
        Filesystem path to the interpreter executable of the virtual Python
        installation.
