List of things to do:

Expand tabs in files and the like

Make the Config object more featureful - should be able to push and pop
config entries. Some sort of stack of dictionaries.

pygame.movie support, or some other way? (embedding gst output?)

Include config changes in text pages

Merge textpage and imagepage

Make textpage know how to do the crappy way of italic and bold fonts. 

Add italic fonts to Config

Refactoring UI layer, merge ironkant into bruce, add a pyglet backend
(aka bruce 2.0)
