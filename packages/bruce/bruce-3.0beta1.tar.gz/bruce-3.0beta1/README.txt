Bruce the Presentation Tool
---------------------------

Bruce the Presentation Tool is for programmers who are tired of fighting
with presentation tools. In its basic form it allows text, code or image
pages and video. It uses pyglet and is extensible to add new page types.


Bruce 3.0 Features (this being the first 3.0 release)
=====================================================

- displays ReStructuredText content with one page per section or transition
- handling of *most* of ReStructuredText, including:

  * inline markup for emphasis, strong and literal
  * literal and line blocks
  * block quotes
  * definition, bullet and enumerated lists (including nesting)
  * images - inline and stand-alone, including scaling
  * page titles (section headings)

- page decorations
- scrolling of content larger than a screenful
- sensible resource location (images, video, sound from the same directory
  as the presentation file)
- and some extensions of ReST:

  * embedded Python interative interpreter sessions
  * videos (embedded just like images) with optional looping
  * stylsheet and decoration changes on the fly (eg. multiple fonts
    per page)

- timer and page count display for practicing
- may specify which screen to open on in multihead
- runs fullscreen at native resolution
- may switch to/from fullscreen quickly

Bruce REQUIRES Python 2.5 and pyglet Subversion r2093, or 1.1 *later than beta1*
when it's released.
