Deprecation
===========

All elements in a survey can be deprecated. Since there might be references to
those elements in external systems it must not be possible to delete an element
once it has been published. Instead it can be marked as deprecated. This will
hide it from all client user interfaces, while still allowing external references
to be resolved if needed.

In situations where it deletion of published items is necessary this can be done
with an account with *Manager* access.
