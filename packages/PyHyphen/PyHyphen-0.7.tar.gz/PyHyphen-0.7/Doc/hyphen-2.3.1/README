Hyphen - hyphenation library to use converted TeX hyphenation patterns
 
(C) 1998 Raph Levien
(C) 2001 ALTLinux, Moscow
(C) 2006 László Németh
 
This was part of libHnj library by Raph Levien.
 
Peter Novodvorsky from ALTLinux cut hyphenation part from libHnj
to use it in OpenOffice.org.
 
Non-standard hyphenation support by László Németh.
  
License is the original LibHnj license:
LibHnj is dual licensed under LGPL and MPL (see also README.libhnj).

Because LGPL allows GPL relicensing, COPYING contains now 
LGPL/GPL/MPL tri-license for explicit Mozilla source compatibility.

Original Libhnj source with OOo's patches are managed by Rene Engelhard
and Chris Halls at Debian:

http://packages.debian.org/stable/libdevel/libhnj-dev
and http://packages.debian.org/unstable/source/libhnj
 
INSTALLATION

./configure
make
make install

Usage: see example.c and "make check".

Note that the input file that contains the words that should be hyphenated
must use Unix line endings.

*****************************************************************************
* Warning! Correct working of Libhnj *needs* prepared hyphenation patterns. *

For example, generating hyph_en_US.dic from "hyphen.us" TeX patterns:
    
perl substrings.pl hyphen.us hyph_en_US.dic
****************************************************************************

See README.hyphen for hyphenation algorithm, README.nonstandard
and doc/tb87nemeth.pdf for non-standard hyphenation.

Java hyphenation: Peter B. West (Folio project) implements a hyphenator with
non standard hyphenation facilities based on extended Libhnj. The HyFo module
is released in binary form as jar files and in source form as zip files.
