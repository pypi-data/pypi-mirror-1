Installing Templess
===================

To make Templess available from other Python packages, either place the
directory on the PYTHONPATH, or copy it to the 'site-packages' directory of
your Python distribution.

Requirements
============

Templess has no dependencies for normal usage.

To run the unit tests, you'll need `py.test`_, part of the 'py lib', a very
cool library written by the `PyPy guys`_.

I've stolen the RelaxNG schema from `thaiopensource.com`_, I'm entirely unsure
about the terms of usage, and whether re-distribution is allowed, please remove
the 'xhtml.rng' file and the 'modules' directory from the 'test' directory
before re-distribution. Also, if it turns out that I'm not allowed to 
distribute the files along with the package, I will remove them (iow, please
let me know if you want them removed!).

Questions, bug reports, etc.
============================

The Templess project pages (Trac) can be found at 
http://templess.johnnydebris.net. You can report bugs and view the Subversion 
repository there. If you have questions, you can send them to 
johnny@johnnydebris.net (until I have a mailinglist set up, please check the
project pages to see if a mailinglist is available before sending me emails).
