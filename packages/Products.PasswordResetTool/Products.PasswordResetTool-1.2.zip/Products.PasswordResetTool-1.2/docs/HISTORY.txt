1.0
---

- Providing 'fullname' now for email notification. This does not really
  close http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6680, but makes it possible to
  use the information the user provided in the mail notification (and its
  translations).
  [gogo]

  far. We only use user id and user name.

------

- If available use the email_charset property instead of default_charset to
  encode mails.
  [hannosch]

- Added the portal name to the subject in the registered_notify_template.pt,
  so it's easier to distinguish those mails for various websites. This
  closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5242.
