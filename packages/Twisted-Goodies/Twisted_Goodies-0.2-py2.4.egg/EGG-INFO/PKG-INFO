Description: 
        The Twisted (TM) asynchronous processing framework is made even more powerful
        with this package of goodies, including
        
        - taskqueue: asynchronous task queueing with a powerful worker/manager
        interface;
        
        - asyncluster: asynchronous operation of a computing cluster with a Node
        Display Manager (NDM) that allows regular workstation usage of cluster
        nodes with computing jobs running behind the scenes.
        
        - webfetch: fetching of web server content including PDFs of patent and
        published patent applications from the USPTO servers.
        
        - misc: miscellaneous goodies, including a deferred tracker for waiting on
        the firing of one or more deferreds without needing references to them.
        
        Twisted-Goodies is maintained and licensed separately from the Twisted
