# AsynCluster: Node Display Manager (NDM):
# A simple X display manager for cluster nodes that also serve as
# access-restricted workstations. An NDM client runs on each node and
# communicates via Twisted's Perspective Broker to the Aysncluster server,
# which regulates when and how much each user can use his account on any of the
# workstations. The NDM server also dispatches cluster operations to the nodes
# via the NDM clients, unbeknownst to the workstation users.
