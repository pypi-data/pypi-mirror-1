1.0b2 (2009-03-12)
==================

- fixed: internal data structures were not stored correctly in the ZODB, so
  BLists loaded from a fresh DB connection would break.

- removed unused code and the dependency on rwproperty

- improved test coverage of the BList API, fixed access to items at index -1
  or at the ends of the valid index range


1.0b1 (2008-10-06)
==================

Initial release.
