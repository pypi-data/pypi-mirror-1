Description: 
        KForge is an open-source (GPL) system for managing software and knowledge projects. It re-uses existing best-of-breed tools such as a versioned storage (subversion), a tracker (trac), and wiki (trac or moinmoin), integrating them with the system's own facilities (projects, users, permissions etc). KForge also provides a complete web interface for project administration as well as a fully-developed plugin system so that new services and features can be easily added.
