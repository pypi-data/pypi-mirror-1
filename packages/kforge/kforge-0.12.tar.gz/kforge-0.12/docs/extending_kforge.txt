Extendable
==========

Suppose you run a subversion hosting service and want to limit the number of subversion repositories a user can have depending on their contribution level.

You would:

  * Create a plugin. Let's call it svn_service_limit.
  * Override the onServiceCreate command to:
    * check whether a svn service is being created
    * if so check how many now exist
    * if it is too many raise an exception
