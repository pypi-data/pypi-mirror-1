Welcome to KForge!
++++++++++++++++++

KForge is an open-source (GPL) system for managing software and knowledge
projects.

It re-uses existing best-of-breed tools such as a versioned storage
(subversion), a tracker (trac), and wiki (trac or moinmoin), integrating them
with the system's own facilities (projects, users, permissions etc).

KForge also provides a complete web interface for project administration as
well as a fully-developed plugin system so that new services and features can
be easily added.
