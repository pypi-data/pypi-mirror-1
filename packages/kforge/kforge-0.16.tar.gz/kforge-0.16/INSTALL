# KForge Installation Instructions

KForge is distributed as the Python package 'kforge'. 

Please report any problems, or other feedback, here:

    mailto:kforge-user@lists.okfn.org

## Step-by-Step Install

### 1. Install dependencies.

Please ensure you have available on your system the following basic
dependencies:

  * python >= 2.3
  * apache >= 2.0
    * modpython (libapache2-mod-python on debian)
    * ssl [optional] (libapache2-mod-ssl on debian)
  * postgresql (is recommended, but you can also use mysql) + relevant python
    bindings (e.g. python-psycopg)
  * django 0.95: <http://www.djangoproject.com/download/0.95.1/tarball/> (if
    django would only provide uploads to pypi this could be done automatically
    via setuptools).
  * setuptools (>= v0.6c)

Additional dependencies will be automatically installed by
setuptools/easy_install. If you wish to see details of what these packages are
see the kforge setup.py file (and the domainmodel setup.py file).

### 2. Setup a database management system for KForge to use

Please consult the instructions for your database system on how to do this.


### 3. Install KForge system

1. Install the Python setuptools package. This package is required by KForge
   installation so it must be installed in advance (all other python packages
   required will be automatically installed by the installation script).

2. EITHER:

  1. Install kforge using easy_install (provided by setuptools):
  
     $ sudo easy_install kforge

  2. OR Download the latest kforge source, extract it change into the
     distribution root directory (directory containing this INSTALL file), and
     run:
   
     $ python setup.py install


### 4. Create a KForge instance/environment

1. Create a KForge configuration file:

  1. $ kforge-makeconfig kforge.conf
  2. Edit the configuration file so that parameters reflect your setup

     [optional]: You may wish to set the environment variables KFORGE_SETTINGS
     to point to your newly created configuration file. This will save you
     having to pass it as as an argument to kforge-admin. You can do this by:

         $ export KFORGE_SETTINGS=<path-to-config-file>

2. Initialise instance:
  
  1. Create data: $ kforge-admin --config <path-to-config> data create 
  2. Initialise database: $ kforge-admin --config <path-to-config> db init

3 . Build apache config and include it in your apache configuration

  1. $ kforge-admin www build

  2. Ensure the generated configuration (location is specified in the config
     file) is then included into your main apache config -- for example
     within the VirtualHost for the domain on which you plan to run kforge. We
     suggest you do this by using the apache Include directive, e.g.:

           # Virtual Host for domain on which KForge will run
           <VirtualHost *:80>
              ServerName mykforge.mydomain.com
              ...
              Include {{path-to-kforge-generated-apache-config}}

           </VirtualHost>
     
     NB: it is important you include the file rather than copy and paste its
     contents as it will be regulary regenerated.

     NB: path-to-kforge-generated-config is specified in your KForge
     configuration file.

### 5. Final touches:

(There is further information on these items in the Extra Notes section below).

  1. Give the web-user (the user under which the web server runs) control of the project and log directories:
           
           $ chown -R {www-user}:{www-user} {directory-path}
  
  2. Auto-reloading of web server configuration (KForge modifies an apache
     config file when new services are created)

     1. EITHER set KForge to auto reload apache by unsetting the
        `no_reload_apache` config variable. Note that for this to work you will
        need to ensure appropriate permissions are granted to the user under
        which the KForge system runs (more details below).
     2. OR: automatically reload the apache configuration using some external
        means. For example, create a cron-job that automatically reloads apache
        configuration at regular intervals (example below) or a monitoring
        service of some kind (such as monit) to reload apache each time the
        apache config file is rebuilt (example below).

### 6. Restart/reload the webserver

### 7. That's it, you are done!


## Additional Notes

### 1. Setting File Permissions

For web access to work for kforge you must allow the web server (apache) write
access to kforge service files (project data and log files). To do this you
have two options:

  1. Have web user own all kforge files.  This may cause problems if you then
     wish to run command line utilities to administer KForge since you may not
     have permission to write to files and directories owned by the web-user.

  2. Allow for dual access by the kforge user and the web-user.

#### 1.2 Allowing for Dual Access

A suitable umask value UMASK to allow group access is 002 or 007.

  1. Set umask for <kforge-user> so that group also has write permissions. Add
  the following line to the your environment setup (e.g. ~/.bashrc)

          $ umask UMASK
  
  2. Giving web user access to kforge installation by adding <apache-user> to
  <kforge-user> group:
  
          $ usermod -G<kforge-user-group> <apache-user>
  
  3. Set umask for apache to allow group access:
    * add the following to apache startup script (usually /usr/sbin/apachectl
    or /usr/sbin/apache2ctl -- you can find it referenced in
    /etc/init.d/apache<version>):

          $ umask UMASK
      
  4. Give group access to existing files and make sure new files and
  directories remain in the <kforge-user-group> by setting sgid

          $ chmod g+wX -R BASE

### 2. Auto-Reloading of the Apache Configuration

It is occasionally necessary for the KForge system to update the apache
configuration file (for example when new services are added). For these changes
to take effect it is then necessary for apache to reload the configuration.
There are two options for how this is done:

#### 2.1 Automatically

In the [www] section of the KForge configuration file set the no_reload_apache
to empty (False) and set the reload_apache variable to the command which will
reload the apache configuration on your system.

NB: In order for this to work the user which owns the apache process must be
able to reload the configuration.  Specifically it must be able to run the
'reload_apache' command specified in the [www] section of the configuration.
You can normally achieve this by adding something to your /etc/sudoers file:

    Cmnd_Alias APACHE = <insert-apache-reload-command>
    [....]
    <www-user-name> ALL =NOPASSWD: APACHE

#### 2.2 Manually

Reload the apache config on a regular basis using some external tool. For
example the following uses cron to reload apache config every half an hour:

    # reload apache config every half an hour 
    # The apache reload command is for apache2 on debian
    # and might need to be modified for other systems
    30 * * * *   /etc/init.d/apache2 reload

Alternatively you could use some form of monitoring service to only reload when
KForge rebuils its apache configuration file. For example, the following uses
monit:

    check file ${file-name} with path ${path-to-kforge-generated-apache-config}
      if changed timestamp
        then exec "/etc/init.d/apache2 reload"
