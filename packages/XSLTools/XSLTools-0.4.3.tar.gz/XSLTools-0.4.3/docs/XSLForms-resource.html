<h1>Using the XSLFormsResource API</h1>
<p>The XSLForms toolkit provides&nbsp;a special WebStack resource class (described in the <a href="Web-resource.html">"Creating Applications: Write a Web Resource"</a>
document),&nbsp; and
from this class,&nbsp;<code>XSLFormsResource</code>,
you can derive your own application-specific resources and use the
class's API to obtain, manipulate and present form data. Although the
supplied <a href="../apidocs/index.html">API documentation</a> provides details of the class's API, specifically in the&nbsp;<code><a href="../apidocs/public/XSLForms.Resources.WebResources-module.html">XSLForms.Resources.WebResources</a></code><a href="../apidocs/public/XSLForms.Resources.WebResources-module.html"></a> module, this document attempts to explain how the API is used in practice.</p><h2>Resource Structure</h2><p>The structure of a Web resource derived from&nbsp;<code>XSLFormsResource</code> should look like this:</p><pre>class MyResource(XSLForms.Resources.WebResources.XSLFormsResource):<br /><br />    [Resource definitions]<br /><br />    def respond_to_form(self, trans, form):<br />        [Examine the form data, see if the user has added or removed anything.]<br />        [Perform additional processing and initialise the form data.]<br />        [Produce some kind of response to show the user the updated form data.]</pre><p>Since&nbsp;<code>XSLFormsResource</code> builds on WebStack's resource mechanisms, we do have the transaction object, <code>trans</code>, available. However,&nbsp;most of the information we need to access and manipulate is generally available through the <code>form</code> object.</p><h2>Defining Resources</h2><p>Classes derived from&nbsp;<code>XSLFormsResource</code>
support the concept of resources which are used to produce output,
support processing and to provide access to useful information. At the
class level it is essential to define at least some of these resources
in order to make a working application.</p><h3>The Resource Directory</h3><p>Since
XSLForms relies on template files residing in the filesystem, along
with other files, we need to define where such files can be found (as
described in the <a href="directory.html">"Creating Applications: Create
a Directory"</a> document). Consequently, it is the convention that all resource classes define such information as follows:</p><pre>class ConfiguratorResource(XSLForms.Resources.WebResources.XSLFormsResource):<br /><br />    resource_dir = os.path.join(os.path.split(__file__)[0], "Resources")</pre><p>All
filenames, defined in the various resource sections (as described
below) must be stated without leading path information - in other
words,&nbsp;as "leafnames" rather than "pathnames". Thus, an example of
an incorrect filename would be&nbsp;<code>/home/paulb/templates/my_template.xhtml</code>, whereas an example of a correct filename would be just&nbsp;<code>my_template.xhtml</code> when correcting the incorrect example.<br /></p><h3>Character Encoding</h3><p>It
is also the convention to define the character encoding of the output
produced by an application and the way ambiguous or
insufficiently-specified input should be interpreted; this is done as
follows:</p><pre>    # Continuing from above...<br /><br />    encoding = "utf-8"</pre><h3>Template Resources</h3><p>The
main purpose of XSLForms is to produce Web page output containing a
visual representation of a form. Therefore, we need to define templates
(as described in the <a href="design.html">"Creating Applications: Design a Template"</a>
document) to express the representation of each kind of form, along
with any intermediate files that may be produced. A&nbsp;special
class-level&nbsp;<code>template_resources</code> dictionary is used to hold such definitions.</p><p>To
define a template resource, we first choose a name (which need not have
any special significance); we then associate with that name&nbsp;a
template filename&nbsp;and an output filename. Finally, we make an
entry for the name and its associated details in the special
class-level&nbsp;<code>template_resources</code> dictionary as follows:</p><pre>    # Continuing from above...<br /><br />    template_resources = {<br />        "configuration" : ("config_template.xhtml", "config_output.xsl"),<br />        # More entries go here...<br />        }</pre><p>The&nbsp;purpose
of the output filename is to define where the intermediate
output-producing stylesheet is to be written, since the template itself
is not actually used to produce output, but knowing where the
intermediate stylesheet can be found is sometimes useful when debugging
templates and is thus defined explicitly to avoid confusion.</p><h3>Initialisation Resources</h3><p>The
XSLForms toolkit also support the initialisation of form data
documents. This document initialisation is useful when preparing a
document for output since some parts of a template may not be produced
unless certain elements are present in the form data document. For
example, a template may contain something like this:</p><pre>&lt;div template:element="hard-disks"&gt;<br />  &lt;input template:selector-field="add-hard-disk,hard-disk" type="submit" name="..." value="Add hard disk"/&gt;<br />  &lt;p template:element="hard-disk"&gt;<br />    ...<br />  &lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;/div&gt;</pre><p>In the above example, if no <code>hard-disks</code> element exists, the selector will not be displayed and there will be no way of adding <code>hard-disk</code> elements. With document initialisation, certain measures can be taken to ensure that the <code>hard-disks</code> element is added before output is generated.</p><p>At the class level, the <code>init_resources</code>
dictionary is used to hold definitions mapping initialiser names (which
need not have any special significance) to the initialiser details: the
filename of the template which defines the structure of the form data,
and an intermediate filename similar to the output filename described
in the context of template resources above. An example of this is as
follows:</p><pre>    # Continuing from above...<br /><br />    init_resources = {<br />        "configuration" : ("config_template.xhtml", "config_input.xsl"),<br />        # More entries go here...<br />        }</pre><p>Note
that initialiser and template resources may (and should) share the same
template filename. As with the output filename for template resources,
the input filename provides firm information about the location of the
stylesheet which actually performs the initialisation process.</p><h3>Document Resources</h3><p>Since
it is the XSLForms convention to access files using a simple name, any
other document resources should be defined in the&nbsp;<code>document_resources</code>
dictionary at the class level. Such document resources may be used in
the initialisation process or in other transformations (as described
below), and are defined as entries mapping names to filenames such as
in the following example:</p><pre>    # Continuing from above...<br /><br />    document_resources = {<br />        "accessories" : "config_accessories.xml",<br />        "base-system" : "config_base_system.xml",<br />        # More entries go here...<br />        }</pre><p>There is no particular limitation on the types of files which can be referenced in the <code>document_resources</code>
dictionary, nor any insistence in the XSLForms toolkit to define such
files as resources - the dictionary is merely a convenience for
accessing files in the resources directory.</p><h3>Transform Resources</h3><p>It is sometimes the case that initialisation of a&nbsp;document 
is not sufficient and that additional processing needs to be done.
Whilst various techniques exist for the processing of XML-based
information, since XSLForms is part of a wider toolkit based on XSL
transformations, it seems reasonable to provide certain facilities for
the usage of such transformations. Thus, stylesheet processing
pipelines may be defined at the class level in the&nbsp;<code>transform_resources</code> dictionary.</p><p>Entries in the <code>transform_resources</code>
dictionary map simple names (which need not have any special
significance) to collections of stylesheet filenames as in the
following example:</p><pre>    # Continuing from above...<br /><br />    transform_resources = {<br />        "filter" : ["filter.xsl"],<br />        # More entries go here...<br />        }</pre><p>Where
more than one stylesheet filename is specified, the stylesheets are
applied from first to last in the transformation. Additional
information, such as stylesheet parameters and referenced documents,
are mentioned when the transformation is acquired and invoked, as
described below.</p><h3>In-Page Update Resources</h3><p>In certain
applications, a technique referred to within XSLForms as "in-page
updates" is employed to provide updates of details within a Web page
without refreshing the entire page itself (and this is described in the
<a href="in-page-updates.html">"Creating Applications: In-Page Updates"</a>
document). When such updates are requested, applications have to
identify the kind of update requested and then to select the correct
part of the Web page to generate as output. Consequently, the
application has to have some kind of record of the different kinds of
updates and the corresponding parts of the whole page template to use,
and this information is recorded in the class-level&nbsp;<code>in_page_resources</code> dictionary.</p><p>The form of an entry in the&nbsp;<code>in_page_resources</code>
dictionary is that of a mapping from a name identifying the kind of
update to the details of the part of the template to be employed in
producing the final output for the update: an intermediate filename
(distinct from that associated with the whole page template), and a
node identifier used to isolate the pertinent part of the whole page
template. Here is an example of an in-page resource definition:</p><pre>    # Continuing from above...<br /><br />    in_page_resources = {<br />        "cpu" : ("config_output_cpu.xsl", "cpu-node"),<br />        # More entries go here...<br />        }</pre><h4>Update Names</h4><p>It
is important to note that, unlike other resources, the name identifying
the kind of update is significant: consider an application available at
the following location:</p><pre>http://localhost/configurator/</pre><p>An in-page update called&nbsp;<code>cpu</code> would be accessed through the following location:</p><pre>http://localhost/configurator/cpu</pre><p>Thus,
the availability of such an update "service" depends on the proper
configuration of the Web application to let such updates be handled by
the resource.</p><h4>Update Nodes</h4><p>The node identifier mentioned
in an in-page update resource definition must be a valid node
identifier in the whole page template document. Thus, if we wished to
use the identifier in the above example together with <code>config_template.xhtml</code>, we would have to ensure that the identifier appeared as a value of an&nbsp;<code>id</code>
node in that template document. Note that the choice of template
document is not defined here, but is instead made when handling an
in-page update request.</p><h2>Examining the Form Data</h2><p>The form data is available through the <code>form</code> object which exposes the&nbsp;<code><a href="../apidocs/public/XSLForms.Fields.Form-class.html">XSLForms.Fields.Form</a></code> API. The most interesting operations are as follows:</p><h3>Obtain the Form Data Documents</h3><p>Since
XSLForms is an XML-based toolkit, the form data is available as XML
documents which can be accessed and manipulated using a DOM-style API.
Upon receiving submitted form data, XSLForms converts the data to such
documents and then makes it available through the <code>form</code>
object by associating certain document names with the actual documents
themselves in a dictionary; this dictionary can be obtained as follows:</p><pre>documents = form.get_documents()</pre><p>Imagine that a template document has been written with <code>items</code> as the root (or topmost) element; such a document will consequently be made available via the <code>form</code> object's documents dictionary using the name <code>items</code>, and can be accessed as follows:</p><pre>items = documents["items"]</pre><p>However,
it may be the case that no form data has been submitted. To avoid
causing an exception, we should really test for the presence of such a
document first:</p><pre>if documents.has_key("items"):<br />    items = documents["items"]</pre><p>Since
it is likely that we will want to work with such a document regardless
of whether one existed before - we must after all prepare such a
document in the first place in order to show it to the user and have it
submitted back to us - we really want to create it if it does not exist:</p><pre>if documents.has_key("items"):<br />    items = documents["items"]<br />else:<br />    items = form.new_document("items")</pre><p>The resulting&nbsp;<code>items</code> object is a genuine DOM-style document containing the form data.</p><h3>Obtain the Form Data Selectors</h3><p>As described in the <a href="selectors.html">"Creating Applications: Add Selectors"</a>
document, XSLForms templates may define selectors - special form fields
which select parts of the form data documents and make those parts
available to applications; such selector information can be obtained as
follows:</p><pre>selectors = form.get_selectors()</pre><p>If a selector was defined with the name&nbsp;<code>remove</code>, then any selected elements that are associated with this selector may be obtained as follows:</p><pre>removed_elements = selectors.get("remove") # which will return None if no such selector was defined</pre><p>Since
the collection contains DOM-style elements, various XML libraries and
tools may be used to manipulate the data. However, XSLForms also
provides convenience functions to add and remove elements.</p><h3>Obtaining Other Parameters</h3><p>Sometimes,
there is a need to obtain the "raw" request parameters submitted by the
Web client or browser which sent the form data in to the application.
Such parameters could be obtained using the&nbsp;<code>trans</code> object, but it is also possible to use the following approach:</p><pre>parameters = form.get_parameters()<br />some_parameter = parameters.get("something") # which returns None if no such parameter exists; a list otherwise<br />another_parameter = parameters.get("another", [""])[0] # which will always return a string, empty if no such parameter was found</pre><h2>Performing Additional Processing</h2><p>Additional
processing of the form data can be performed in many different ways,
limited only by the DOM-style API exposed by the data and the XSL
transformation features available in the XSLForms toolkit.</p><h3>Transformations</h3><p>To take advantage of the defined&nbsp;<code>transform_resources</code>, we can call a method on the resource itself to prepare such resources:</p><pre>filter_stylesheets = self.prepare_transform("filter")</pre><p>Then,
with the result of this call (a list of stylesheet filenames), we can
then perform a transformation on a document, producing a new document
from the results:</p><pre>configuration_document = self.get_result(filter_stylesheets, configuration_document)</pre><p>This new document is different from the document supplied to the&nbsp;<code>get_result</code>
method. It should therefore be noted that any references to elements in
the old document will not affect the new document; thus selectors
previously obtained from the&nbsp;<code>form</code> object will not refer to elements in the new document. However, by setting the new document in the&nbsp;<code>form</code> object, new selectors may be obtained referring to elements in the new document:</p><pre>form.set_document("configuration", configuration_document)<br />selectors = form.get_selectors()</pre><p>Care
must be taken doing this, however, since the selectors may now not
refer to valid elements - the transformation may have removed or moved
elements previously referred to by the selectors.</p><p>The&nbsp;<code>get_result</code>
method also supports stylesheet parameters, document references and
stylesheet expressions; these are described in the "Additional
Stylesheet Parameters" section below.</p><h3>Using Selectors to Modify the Data</h3><p>As
described above in "Obtain the Form Data Selectors", if the user of an
application requested changes to the form data using a selector field
(typically represented by a button or checkbox in a Web page), a list
of selected elements will be available to the resource through the&nbsp;<code>form</code> object. Given a selector which is associated with a&nbsp;<code>remove</code>
operation, we could use the DOM-style API exposed by the contents of
the selectors to perform such an operation in the resource using our
own code. However, the XSLForms toolkit provides some useful
convenience functions to assist in the removal or addition of elements:</p><pre># After doing this:<br /># import XSLForms.Utils<br /><br /># Removing elements...<br /><br />removed_elements = selectors.get("remove")       # this may return None<br />XSLForms.Utils.remove_elements(removed_elements) # this can handle None, realising that no elements are to be removed<br /><br /># Adding elements...<br /><br />places_to_add_elements = selectors.get("add")<br />XSLForms.Utils.add_elements(places_to_add_elements, "element")</pre><p>See the&nbsp;<code><a href="../apidocs/public/XSLForms.Utils-module.html">XSLForms.Utils</a></code><a href="../apidocs/public/XSLForms.Utils-module.html"></a> documentation for more information on these functions.<br /></p><h2>Document Initialisation</h2><p>The initialisation of a document, using information defined in the&nbsp;<code>init_resources</code>
attribute, is similar to the transformation of a document as described
above. First, we obtain a reference to an initialisation stylesheet:</p><pre>init_stylesheet = self.prepare_initialiser("configuration")</pre><p>Note
that only a single stylesheet is returned. With the result of the call,
we then perform a transformation similar to the above activity,
although we have to supply the returned stylesheet in a list to be
compatible with the&nbsp;<code>get_result</code> method:</p><pre>configuration_document = self.get_result([init_stylesheet], configuration_document)</pre><p>In practice, the above call will probably not suffice: if <a href="multiple.html">multiple-choice fields</a>
are used in the template, there will be a need to initialise such
elements using references to other documents containing the values of
such fields; for example:</p><pre>configuration_document = self.get_result([init_stylesheet], configuration_document,<br />    references={<br />        "cpu" : self.prepare_document("cpu")<br />    })</pre><p>The
use of document references and other stylesheet parameter information
is described in the "Additional Stylesheet Parameters" section below.</p><h2>Preparing Responses</h2><p>The process of preparing a response involves three main steps:</p><ol><li>Setting a content type.</li><li>Defining an output stylesheet and parameter information.</li><li>Sending the output to the user.</li></ol><h3>Setting a Content Type</h3><p>In
the examples supplied with XSLTools, the content type is generally
defined as that of XHTML, meaning that the resulting output should be
accessible to most modern Web browsers. When writing resources based
on&nbsp;<code>XSLFormsResource</code>, we can just use the WebStack API to set the content type:</p><pre>trans.set_content_type(WebStack.Generic.ContentType("application/xhtml+xml", self.encoding))</pre><p>Note that the&nbsp;<code>encoding</code> attribute is used here to make the character encoding clear to the user's Web browser or client.</p><h3>Defining an Output Stylesheet</h3><p>In most cases, the&nbsp;output stylesheet can be chosen by selecting a template name and invoking a method on the resource:</p><pre>output_stylesheet = self.prepare_output("configuration")</pre><p>However,
where in-page updates are handled, we may need to check to see if we
should be sending a fragment of the whole page instead. First, we must
check to see if an in-page update&nbsp;is being requested:</p><pre>in_page_resource = self.get_in_page_resource(trans)</pre><p>The
result of calling the above method should be a string identifying an
"in-page resource" - that is, a kind of in-page update related to part
of the whole page -&nbsp;if such a "resource" is actually being
requested. We can thus check to see if such a request is taking place:</p><pre>if in_page_resource in self.in_page_resources.keys():<br />    [Handle the in-page update request]</pre><p>If
so, instead of getting a stylesheet which produces output for the whole
page, we get a "fragment" which produces output only for the part of
the page being updated:</p><pre>    # Continued from above...<br /><br />    output_stylesheet = self.prepare_fragment("configuration", in_page_resource)<br />    stylesheet_parameters = self.prepare_parameters(parameters) # from form.get_parameters()</pre><p>An
additional step when handling in-page updates is the usage of
stylesheet parameters to send in some required information about the
location of the update in the page. The&nbsp;<code>prepare_parameters</code>
method on the resource is used to discover this information and return
it as a dictionary to be passed to the final output generation activity.</p><h3>Sending the Output to the User</h3><p>Given
an output stylesheet reference and possibly some parameters, the output
is sent to the user with a single call to a method on the resource
object:</p><pre>self.send_output(trans, [output_stylesheet], configuration_document, stylesheet_parameters)</pre><p>This method should, using the&nbsp;<code>encoding</code>
attribute on the resource class, ensure that the generated output is
correct and consistent for the user's Web browser or client.</p><h2>Additional Stylesheet Parameters</h2><p>In addition to a collection of stylesheets and a document to process, the&nbsp;<code>get_result</code> and&nbsp;<code>send_output</code> methods can accept a number of possible sources of information:</p><ul><li>Stylesheet parameters</li><li>Document references</li><li>Stylesheet expressions</li></ul><p>Generally,
stylesheet parameters are used to configure the output in some way,
whilst document references and stylesheet expressions typically offer a
means of accessing additional information that is to be merged in or
included in the processed document. The most common need to introduce
additional information arises from the use of multiple-choice elements;
consider the list of values given in the <a href="multiple.html">"Creating Applications: Adding Multiple-Choice Fields and Values"</a> document:</p><pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;<br />&lt;type&gt;<br />  &lt;type-enum value="(Not selected)"/&gt;<br />  &lt;type-enum value="Important"/&gt;<br />  &lt;type-enum value="Not important"/&gt;<br />  &lt;type-enum value="Personal"/&gt;<br />&lt;/type&gt;</pre><p>Such
information needs to reside somewhere and then be referenced in order
to be included in the processing operation being performed, which would
either be a document initialisation or just a normal transformation.</p><h3>Document References</h3><p>To refer to an externally-defined information, we define the document resource as described above:</p><pre>    # At class attribute level...<br /><br />    document_resources = {<br />        "types" : "types.xml",<br />        # Other documents...<br />        }</pre><p>Then, we access the resource, getting a reference to the document:</p><pre>types_xml = self.prepare_document("types")</pre><p>To bring&nbsp;this document into the processing operation, we add an entry to a dictionary passed as the&nbsp;<code>references</code> parameter to&nbsp;<code>get_result</code> (or&nbsp;<code>send_output</code>, if appropriate). In the above example, the information is referenced as follows in the template document:</p><pre>    &lt;select template:multiple-choice-field="type,value" name="..."&gt;<br />      &lt;option template:multiple-choice-value="type-enum,value,selected" value="..." /&gt;<br />    &lt;/select&gt;</pre><p>Therefore, we take the element name,&nbsp;<code>type</code>, from the field and use it to refer to the external document in the dictionary of references:</p><pre>structure = self.get_result([structure_xsl], structure, references={"type" : types_xml})</pre><p>This should result in the stylesheet incorporating the information from the types document into the transformation.</p><h3>Stylesheet Expressions</h3><p>In
more advanced cases, referencing external documents does not provide
enough flexibility when introducing additional information into a
transformation. An alternative approach involves copying data into the
document to be processed and then to supply references to the data in
its new location within the document.</p></body></html>
