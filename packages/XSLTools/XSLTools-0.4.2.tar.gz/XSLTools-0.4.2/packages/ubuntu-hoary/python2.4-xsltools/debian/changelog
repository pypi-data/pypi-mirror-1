xsltools (0.4.2-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Added a content type check in the XSLFormsResource
    class, permitting non-form-based resources to access the
    raw request data, rather than have the data processed
    unsuccessfully and consequently discarded.
  * Added a script and a function to fix template namespaces
    after editing in a careless editor.
  * Changed libxml2mod and libxsltmod import details to try
    libxmlmods - suggested by Lucian Wischik for libxml2dom.

xsltools (0.4.1-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Made translations specified using the template:i18n
    annotation take priority over template:value
    annotations.
  * Added expression-based template:i18n annotations, and
    provided fallback output for such translations based on
    the value of the evaluated expression.

xsltools (0.4-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Changed the preparation of templates to produce
    rule-based output stylesheets, thus permitting recursive
    templates. This requires an extra expr-prefix annotation
    to be used in certain kinds of templates.
  * Added a recursive template example application.
  * Changed fragment production to use original template
    documents instead of output stylesheets.
  * Changed the in_page_resources attribute to provide the
    output identifier, thus changing the prepare_fragment
    method in Web resources so that only the fragment
    identifier needs to be supplied.
  * Added the XSLForms.Resources.WebResources.prepare_resources
    method for the preparation of initialiser and output
    stylesheets before an application is run.
  * Changed selectors to not automatically create elements
    in the form data document unless requested to do so.
    Introduced a Form.get_selector method in
    XSLForms.Fields.
  * Permitted the creation of hierarchies of elements in
    XSLForms.Utils.add_elements.
  * Introduced dynamic parameter evaluation for multiple-
    choice fields in order to support sources of multiple-
    choice values which reside in the form data document
    itself.
  * Added the FixNamespace.xsl stylesheet to correct
    documents saved by HTML editors which strip namespace
    prefixes.
  * Fixed filesystem encoding issues in the Candidate
    example; fixed language preference access in the
    Configurator and VerySimple examples.
  * Changed the BaseHTTPRequestHandler version of the
    Candidate example to store data in a subdirectory of
    the current working directory, thus allowing the
    demonstration application to work after package
    installation.

xsltools (0.3-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Introduced copying of multiple-choice value element
    contents so that option element labels can differ from
    the underlying values.
  * Added internationalisation support, providing the
    template:i18n annotation and the template:i18n extension
    function.
  * Updated the documentation to cover the above new
    features.
  * Fixed non-GET/POST request method handling in
    WebResources.
  * Added the xslform_preparemacro.py script.
  * Added an experimental template:range extension function.
