<h1>Template Design</h1>
<p>The template is a central concept in the XSLForms toolkit: each
template defines the structure of the XML document information being
processed by an application (or a resource within an application), and
each template presents that document information in a form readable by
an application's users.</p><h2>Defining a Structure</h2><p>The relationship between the defined structure and the template itself is described in the <a href="data.html">"Creating Applications: Design the Structure of the Form Data"</a>
document. Typically, one will have in mind a particular structure to be
presented and made editable by the template, and one will begin the
template design process with this structure in mind, although the
structure definition is likely to be modified by decisions made in the
design process and when testing the user interface by using the
application itself.</p><h2>Defining the Presentation</h2><p>Given
a
document structure, one has to think about the most suitable ways of
representing the information in the user interface. The most common
medium for presentation is HTML and its derivatives, and we consider in
this document the different HTML elements available to present
different
"patterns" in a document structure.</p><h3>Multiple Languages and Translations</h3><p>One
presentation issue which is largely separate from the presentation of
the structure of form data involves the use of appropriate languages
for an application's users - this is described in the <a href="internationalisation.html">"Internationalisation"</a> document.</p><h3>General Template Structure</h3><ul><li>Described in the <a href="design.html">"Creating Applications: Design a Template"</a> document.</li></ul><p>Templates based on HTML usually have the following general structure:</p><pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;<br />&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"<br />      xmlns:template="http://www.boddie.org.uk/ns/xmltools/template"&gt;<br />&lt;head&gt;<br />  &lt;title&gt;Some title&lt;/title&gt;<br />&lt;/head&gt;<br />&lt;body template:element="structure"&gt;<br /><br />&lt;!-- The interesting part goes here... --&gt;<br /><br />&lt;/body&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;</pre><p>Since we will want to edit the data produced by such a template, an HTML <code>form</code> element is usually necessary within the <code>body</code> element:</p><pre>&lt;body template:element="structure"&gt;<br />&lt;form action="" method="POST"&gt;<br /><br />&lt;!-- The interesting part goes here... --&gt;<br /><br />&lt;/form&gt;<br />&lt;/body&gt;</pre><p>We usually define the <code>method</code> as <code>post</code> in order to minimise complications with handling the data in the XSLForms toolkit.</p><h3>Static Elements</h3><ul><li>See <a href="reference.html#element">"template:element"</a> in the <a href="reference.html">"Template Attribute Reference"</a> document.</li></ul><p>Static
elements, as opposed to collection elements, are elements in the
form data document structure which maintain some kind of organisation or grouping
within a document, but whose presence cannot be edited by the user of
an application. For example, in the <a href="XSLForms-resource.html">"Using the XSLFormsResource API"</a> document the following example is given:</p><pre>&lt;div template:element="hard-disks"&gt;<br />  &lt;input template:selector-field="add-hard-disk,hard-disk" type="submit" name="..." value="Add hard disk"/&gt;<br />  &lt;p template:element="hard-disk"&gt;<br />    ...<br />  &lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;/div&gt;</pre><p>Here, the <code>hard-disks</code> element is present to group <code>hard-disk</code>
elements together. We can insist that elements are treated as static
elements in the document initialisation process by adding the <code>template:init</code> attribute to the annotated template element:</p><pre>&lt;div template:element="hard-disks" template:init="yes"&gt;<br />  ...<br />&lt;/div&gt;</pre><p>See the <a href="reference.html">"Template Attribute Reference"</a> document for more information on the <code>template:init</code> attribute.</p><h3>Collection Elements</h3><ul><li>See <a href="reference.html#element">"template:element"</a> in the <a href="reference.html">"Template Attribute Reference"</a> document.</li><li>Described in the <a href="structure.html#AnnotatingTheTemplate">"Annotating the Template"</a> section of the  <a href="design.html">"Creating Applications: Design a Template"</a> document.</li></ul><p>Collection
elements are elements in the form data document structure which represent a
collection of items or objects and whose presence may be edited by the
user of an application. In the following example,  <code>hard-disk</code> elements are collection elements:</p><pre>&lt;p template:element="hard-disk"&gt;<br />  ...<br />&lt;/p&gt;</pre><p>Whether
elements are treated as collection elements in the document
initialisation process depends on the presence or absence of the <code>template:init</code> attribute on the annotated template element: if the <code>template:init</code> attribute is present, the value of that attribute will determine whether such elements (named in the <code>template:element</code>
attribute) will be created automatically (and thus behave like static
elements) or created dynamically (and thus behave like collection
elements); if the <code>template:init</code> attribute is absent,
the way such elements are treated will depend on other factors, notably
the presence of selectors referring to such elements. Here is such a selector:</p><pre>&lt;input template:selector-field="add-hard-disk,hard-disk" type="submit" name="..." value="Add hard disk"/&gt;</pre><p>In the above example, the selector field (see below and in the <a href="reference.html">"Template Attribute Reference"</a> document for more details) mentions the document structure's <code>hard-disk</code>
element; thus, the element is treated as a collection. If we did not
have such a selector in the template, we could also have used a <code>template:init</code> attribute to have the same effect:</p><pre>&lt;p template:element="hard-disk" template:init="no"&gt;<br />  ...<br />&lt;/p&gt;</pre><p>Generally,
collection elements do have selector fields providing operations on the
collection, and so the extra annotation is not usually necessary.</p><h3>Selectors</h3><ul><li>Described in the <a href="selectors.html">"Creating Applications: Add Selectors"</a>
document.</li></ul><p>Selectors provide a means to select elements in collections
and to request that some operation be performed on those selected
elements. Two common selector types are those concerning the addition
and removal of elements.</p><h4>Selectors as Buttons</h4><ul><li>See <a href="reference.html#selector-field">"template:selector-field"</a> in the <a href="reference.html">"Template Attribute Reference"</a> document.</li></ul><p>In the collection elements example above, we saw the usage of a selector which could be used to add elements to a document:</p><pre>&lt;input template:selector-field="add-hard-disk,hard-disk" type="submit" name="..." value="Add hard disk"/&gt;</pre><p>This would produce the following HTML form control:</p><p><input name="..." value="Add hard disk" type="submit" /> </p><p>As described in the <a href="XSLForms-resource.html">"Using the XSLFormsResource API"</a> document, the above selector (with the name <code>add-hard-disk</code>)
could be obtained in the application itself, and the collection of
elements associated with the selector used as a collection of places to
insert new elements into the form data document. Similarly, a
selector which could be used to remove elements from a document could
be specified as follows:</p><pre>&lt;input template:selector-field="remove-hard-disk" type="submit" name="..." value="Remove hard disk"/&gt;</pre><p>This would produce the following HTML form control:</p><p><input name="..." value="Remove hard disk" type="submit" /></p><p>Again,
such a selector could be obtained in the application, and the
associated elements could then be removed from the document.</p><h4>Selectors as Checkboxes</h4><ul><li>See <a href="reference.html#selector-field">"template:selector-field"</a> in the <a href="reference.html">"Template Attribute Reference"</a> document.</li></ul><p>Whilst
selectors can be modelled conveniently with buttons, since they may
cause an immediate update to the form data with feedback from the
operation occurring immediately, other form controls can be used to
communicate the selection of form data. For example:</p><pre>&lt;input template:selector-field="select-hard-disk" type="checkbox" name="..." value="..."/&gt;</pre><p>This would produce the following HTML form control:</p><p><input name="..." value="..." type="checkbox" /></p><p>Such
a checkbox could be used to mark a particular element in the form data
document as being selected, with the application left to determine what
kind of operation should be applied to the selection.</p><h3>Attribute Values</h3><ul><li>See <a href="reference.html#attribute">"template:attribute"</a> in the <a href="reference.html">"Template Attribute Reference"</a> document.</li></ul><p>A
simple attribute value is defined to be a value, freely editable set in
an attribute on some element in a document. For example, in the form data document:</p><pre>&lt;element attribute="value"/&gt;</pre><p>The
following sections describe ways in which the value can be viewed,
edited or changed through the presentation of the attribute in the
template.</p><h4>Editable Fields</h4><ul><li>See <a href="reference.html#attribute-field">"template:attribute-field"</a> in the <a href="reference.html">"Template Attribute Reference"</a> document.</li></ul><p>If we are to permit an attribute value to be edited, we might choose the following template representation:</p><pre>&lt;input template:attribute-field="attribute" name="..." value="..." type="text"/&gt;</pre><p>This would produce the following HTML form control:</p><p><input name="..." value="..." /></p><p>Note
that the element on which the attribute is defined is not declared in
the above example, although we could also add such an annotation to
the <code>input</code> element (as described above and in the <a href="reference.html">"Template Attribute Reference"</a> document).</p><h4>Read-only Values</h4><ul><li>See <a href="reference.html#attribute-area">"template:attribute-area"</a> in the <a href="reference.html">"Template Attribute Reference"</a> document.</li></ul><p>Where attribute values are only displayed, we can use non-form HTML elements to display them:</p><pre>&lt;span template:attribute-area="attribute"&gt;some text to be replaced with the value&lt;/span&gt;</pre><p>This would insert the value of the attribute in the document within the defined <code>span</code> template element.</p><h4>Hidden Values</h4><ul><li>See <a href="reference.html#attribute-field">"template:attribute-field"</a> in the <a href="reference.html">"Template Attribute Reference"</a> document.</li></ul><p>Where
attribute values are to be retained and submitted again by the
user, but probably not edited, we need to include them as hidden
elements:</p><pre>&lt;input template:attribute-field="attribute" name="..." value="..." type="hidden"/&gt;</pre><p>This
keeps the contents of the document intact, but it should be noted that
such values are only uneditable in the way they are presented to
the user, and that a determined user could easily find a way to change
such values and send them in to the application.</p><h4>Checkboxes</h4><ul><li>See <a href="reference.html#attribute-button">"template:attribute-button"</a> in the <a href="reference.html">"Template Attribute Reference"</a> document.</li></ul><p>Sometimes,
attributes are used to retain particular values that correspond to a
boolean state. Such values can be modelled as follows:</p><pre>&lt;input template:attribute-button="attribute,true,checked" name="..." value="..." type="checkbox"/&gt;</pre><p>This would produce the following HTML form control:</p><p><input name="..." value="..." type="checkbox" /></p><p>If selected, the checkbox would when submitted cause the attribute to contain the value <code>true</code>
in the form data document. Moreover, the presence of the attribute with
such a value would cause the checkbox to appear selected when the form
data is presented to the user again.</p><h4>Radio Buttons</h4><ul><li>See <a href="reference.html#attribute-button">"template:attribute-button"</a> in the <a href="reference.html">"Template Attribute Reference"</a> document.</li></ul><p>Unlike
checkboxes, radio buttons typically offer a means to select a value
from a number of alternatives. However, like checkboxes the selected
value would be stored on a single attribute in the form data document.
For example:</p><pre>&lt;input type="radio" template:attribute-button="attribute,some-choice,checked" name="..." value="..." /&gt;</pre><p>This would produce the following HTML form control:</p><p><input name="..." value="..." type="radio" /></p><p>If
selected, the radio button when submitted would cause the attribute to
contain the stated value in the form data document, which would be <code>some-choice</code>
for the button in the above example. Should a different button
associated with the same attribute be pressed, the value stated in the
definition of that button would be stored in the attribute. Like the
checkbox, the selected radio button would remain selected when the form
data is presented to the user again.</p><h3>Attributes Set from Lists of Choices</h3><p>Certain
attributes may have a list of acceptable values associated with them,
and whilst such attributes typically reside in the form data document
carrying a single, currently set value, the representation of the
document processed by the template must somehow incorporate the list of
acceptable values; this was covered in the <a href="multiple.html">"Creating Applications: Adding Multiple-Choice Fields and Values"</a> document, and involved adding new elements, each carrying a single acceptable value for the attribute concerned.</p><h4>Single Selection Menus</h4><ul><li>See <a href="reference.html#multiple-choice-field">"template:multiple-choice-field"</a> and <a href="reference.html#multiple-choice-value">"template:multiple-choice-value"</a> in the <a href="reference.html">"Template Attribute Reference"</a> document.</li><li>Described in the <a href="multiple.html">"Creating Applications: Adding Multiple-Choice Fields and Values"</a> document.</li></ul><p>In
certain situations, it makes more sense to present acceptable values
for an attribute in a menu-like representation in the final output
presented to the user. With the element on which the attribute resides
now containing a list of sub-elements with each carrying an acceptable
value in an attribute, a form control can be defined as follows:</p><pre>&lt;select template:multiple-choice-field="-,attribute" name="..."&gt;<br />  &lt;option template:multiple-choice-value="element-enum,value,selected" value="..."&gt;&lt;/option&gt;<br />&lt;/select&gt;</pre><p>This would produce the following HTML form control:</p><p><select name="..."><option>First</option><option>Second</option><option>Third</option></select></p><p>Note that the element on which the attribute is defined is not declared
in the above example, although we could modify the <code>template:multiple-choice-field</code> annotation on
the <code>select</code> element (as described in the <a href="reference.html">"Template Attribute Reference"</a> document) and replace the <code>-</code> with a name such as <code>element</code>.</p><h4>Multiple Selection Lists</h4><ul><li>See <a href="reference.html#multiple-choice-list-field">"template:multiple-choice-list-field"</a> and <a href="reference.html#multiple-choice-list-value">"template:multiple-choice-list-value"</a> in the <a href="reference.html">"Template Attribute Reference"</a> document.</li><li>Described in the <a href="multivalue.html">"Creating Applications: Adding Multivalued Fields"</a> document.</li></ul><p>In
other situations, where many values can be chosen, a single attribute
on a single element is not sufficient to hold all such values.
Consequently, a collection of elements is employed, each with an
attribute defined to hold a single value. With each value-bearing
element now containing a list of sub-elements with each carrying
an acceptable
value in an attribute, a form control can be defined as follows:</p><pre>&lt;select name="..." template:multiple-choice-list-field="-,element-enum,attribute" multiple="multiple"&gt;<br />  &lt;option template:multiple-choice-list-value="element-enum,value,selected" value="..."&gt;&lt;/option&gt;<br />&lt;/select&gt;</pre><p>This would produce the following HTML form control:</p><p><select multiple="multiple" name="..."><option>First</option><option>Second</option><option>Third</option></select></p><p>Note that unlike the single selection menu example, an additional parameter is present in the <code>template:multiple-choice-list-field</code> annotation, but the first parameter is given as the placeholder value <code>-</code> (and is regarded as not having been stated). However, had the first parameter been stated (as opposed to being given as <code>-</code>)
the consequence would merely have been that upon submission of the
form, the elements in the collection would have been enclosed
within a single named element. In the above example, we assume that a
suitable element has already been defined in a template element and
that the above <code>select</code> element resides within that template element, thus providing the necessary enclosure (as recommended in the <a href="advice.html">"Creating Applications: Recommendations and Advice"</a> document).</p></body></html>
