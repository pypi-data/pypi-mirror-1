xsltools (0.4.6-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Improved the Login module, enabling the
    VerySimpleWithLogin example for various frameworks.
  * Relicensed under the LGPL version 3 or later.
  * Upgraded to Sarissa 0.9.7.8 (compatible with LGPL/GPL
    version 3), removing a test around DOMParser so that
    Konqueror 3.4.0 is still supported.

xsltools (0.4.5-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Fixed the result of transformations in XSLOutput: proper
    document nodes are now produced.
  * Added an XSLForms.Resources.Login module which provides
    resources to support login screens and redirects.
  * Fixed newlines in the attributes created from fields in
    XSLForms: CR characters are no longer included since
    this caused the doubling up of newlines in Firefox.

xsltools (0.4.4-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Fixed translation selection for the template:i18n
    annotation attribute, not just for the template:i18n
    extension function - more apologies for resulting output
    changes!
  * Improved the template fixing stylesheet and added some
    documentation for the script and the related expr-prefix
    attribute.
  * Introduced WebStack 1.2.2 EncodingSelector and encoding
    changes.
  * Added docstring and return value for the
    write_month_to_document function in XSLTools.XMLCalendar.

xsltools (0.4.3-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Fixed translation selection when an unsupported locale
    is specified, choosing the first locale as the default
    (rather than exposing the values themselves as
    translations). Note that this is an unfortunate and
    subtle change which may affect application output -
    apologies are hereby offered!

xsltools (0.4.2-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Added a content type check in the XSLFormsResource
    class, permitting non-form-based resources to access the
    raw request data, rather than have the data processed
    unsuccessfully and consequently discarded.
  * Added a script and a function to fix template namespaces
    after editing in a careless editor.
  * Changed libxml2mod and libxsltmod import details to try
    libxmlmods - suggested by Lucian Wischik for libxml2dom.

xsltools (0.4.1-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Made translations specified using the template:i18n
    annotation take priority over template:value
    annotations.
  * Added expression-based template:i18n annotations, and
    provided fallback output for such translations based on
    the value of the evaluated expression.

xsltools (0.4-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Changed the preparation of templates to produce
    rule-based output stylesheets, thus permitting recursive
    templates. This requires an extra expr-prefix annotation
    to be used in certain kinds of templates.
  * Added a recursive template example application.
  * Changed fragment production to use original template
    documents instead of output stylesheets.
  * Changed the in_page_resources attribute to provide the
    output identifier, thus changing the prepare_fragment
    method in Web resources so that only the fragment
    identifier needs to be supplied.
  * Added the XSLForms.Resources.WebResources.prepare_resources
    method for the preparation of initialiser and output
    stylesheets before an application is run.
  * Changed selectors to not automatically create elements
    in the form data document unless requested to do so.
    Introduced a Form.get_selector method in
    XSLForms.Fields.
  * Permitted the creation of hierarchies of elements in
    XSLForms.Utils.add_elements.
  * Introduced dynamic parameter evaluation for multiple-
    choice fields in order to support sources of multiple-
    choice values which reside in the form data document
    itself.
  * Added the FixNamespace.xsl stylesheet to correct
    documents saved by HTML editors which strip namespace
    prefixes.
  * Fixed filesystem encoding issues in the Candidate
    example; fixed language preference access in the
    Configurator and VerySimple examples.
  * Changed the BaseHTTPRequestHandler version of the
    Candidate example to store data in a subdirectory of
    the current working directory, thus allowing the
    demonstration application to work after package
    installation.

xsltools (0.3.1-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Fixed copyright and licensing information.

xsltools (0.3-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Introduced copying of multiple-choice value element
    contents so that option element labels can differ from
    the underlying values.
  * Added internationalisation support, providing the
    template:i18n annotation and the template:i18n extension
    function.
  * Updated the documentation to cover the above new
    features.
  * Fixed non-GET/POST request method handling in
    WebResources.
  * Added the xslform_preparemacro.py script.
  * Added an experimental template:range extension function.
