Description: This is a pluggable command-line tool.
        
        It includes some built-in features;
        
        * Create file layouts for packages.  For instance, ``paste create
        --template=basic_package MyPackage`` will create a `setuptools
        <http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools>`_-ready
        file layout.
        
        * Serving up web applications, with configuration based on
        `paste.deploy <http://pythonpaste.org/deploy/paste-deploy.html>`_.
        
        The latest version is available in a `Subversion repository
        <http://svn.pythonpaste.org/Paste/Script/trunk#egg=PasteScript-dev>`_.
        
        For the latest changes see the `news file
        <http://pythonpaste.org/script/news.html>`_.  This package requires
        `Cheetah
        <http://cheeseshop.python.org/packages/source/C/Cheetah/Cheetah-1.0.tar.gz>`_
        
        Changes in 1.1
        --------------
        
        * Added a ``warn_returncode`` option to ``Command.run_command``, and
        make ``ensure_file`` use this for its svn command.
        
        * If the svn command-line program isn't working for you, commands that
        use ``ensure_file`` will continue to work but just with a warning.
        
        * Removed copyright notice that was accidentally included in new
        packages created by ``paster create``
        
        * Allow variable assignments at the end of ``paster serve``, like
        ``paster serve http_port=80``; then you can use ``%(http_port)s`` in
        your config files (requires up-to-date Paste Deploy).
        
        * Allow a ``package_dir`` variable so that you can put your package
        into subdirectories of the base directory (e.g., ``src/``)
        
        * Changes to the ``twisted.web2`` wrapper (from pythy).
        
        * Warn when you run ``paster setup-app`` and no modules are listed in
        ``top_level.txt`` (which can happen with a newly checked out
        project).
