Description: This is a pluggable command-line tool.
        
        It includes some built-in features;
        
        * Create file layouts for packages.  For instance, ``paste create
        --template=basic_package MyPackage`` will create a `setuptools
        <http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools>`_-ready
        file layout.
        
        * Serving up web applications, with configuration based on
        `paste.deploy <http://pythonpaste.org/deploy/paste-deploy.html>`_.
        
        The latest version is available in a `Subversion repository
        <http://svn.pythonpaste.org/Paste/Script/trunk#egg=PasteScript-dev>`_.
        
        For the latest changes see the `news file
        <http://pythonpaste.org/script/news.html>`_.  This package requires
        `Cheetah
        <http://cheeseshop.python.org/packages/source/C/Cheetah/Cheetah-1.0.tar.gz>`_
        
        Changes in 1.6
        --------------
        
        * Added commands ``paster request config.ini URL`` and ``paster post
        config.ini URL < post-body``, that allow you to do artificial
        requests to applications.
        
        * Check the writability of the pid and log files earlier.  This caused
        particular problems if you started it in daemon mode, and the files
        weren't writable.  From Chris Atlee.
        
        * Start the monitor (when using ``--monitor``) after daemonizing, so
        that ``paster serve --monitor --daemon`` works (before it would
        constantly restart).
        
        * In Paste Script templates, you can give ``should_echo=False`` in
        variable definitions, and if the user is queried for the variable
        then the input will not be echoed (as for a password).  From Dirceu
        Pereira Tiegs.
        
        * Added a method
        ``paste.script.appinstall.Installer.template_renderer``, which can
        be used to override template substitution with ``paster
        make-config``.  The function is similar to the same function used
        with ``paster create`` templates.
        
        * Remove ``--daemon`` option from Windows, as it depends on
        ``os.fork``
        
        * When using ``paster create`` and inserting text with a ``-*-``
        marker, multi-line text will no longer be reinserted.
        
        * Improved output when skipping templates with ``paster create``.
        
        * When starting a server with ``paster serve --daemon`` and the pid
        file exists and describes a running process, do not start another
        process.
        
        * Added ``umask`` option to
        ``egg:PasteScript#flup_fcgi_thread/fork``.
        
        * Deprecate the flup entry points, as flup now has the necessary entry
        points in its own package.
