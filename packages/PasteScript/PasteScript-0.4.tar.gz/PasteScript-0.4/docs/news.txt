  can make a script into an executable.

  - Handle bad PID files better

  - Daemonization is more reliable

  - Allow ``start``, ``stop``, ``restart`` instead of just options

* Improvements to ``paster create`` command:

  - Invoked interactively by default (so that you are warned before
    overwriting files)

  - ``points`` for viewing Egg entry point information

  - ``prepare-app`` and ``setup-app`` for installing web applications

* Fixed bug in how Egg distributions are loaded.
