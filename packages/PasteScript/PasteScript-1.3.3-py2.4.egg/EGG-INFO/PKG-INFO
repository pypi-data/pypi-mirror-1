Description: This is a pluggable command-line tool.
        
        It includes some built-in features;
        
        * Create file layouts for packages.  For instance, ``paste create
        --template=basic_package MyPackage`` will create a `setuptools
        <http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools>`_-ready
        file layout.
        
        * Serving up web applications, with configuration based on
        `paste.deploy <http://pythonpaste.org/deploy/paste-deploy.html>`_.
        
        The latest version is available in a `Subversion repository
        <http://svn.pythonpaste.org/Paste/Script/trunk#egg=PasteScript-dev>`_.
        
        For the latest changes see the `news file
        <http://pythonpaste.org/script/news.html>`_.  This package requires
        `Cheetah
        <http://cheeseshop.python.org/packages/source/C/Cheetah/Cheetah-1.0.tar.gz>`_
        
        Changes in 1.3.3
        ----------------
        
        * Fixed problem with ``paster serve`` on Windows.  Also on Windows,
        fixed issue with executables with spaces in their names (this case
        requires the ``win32all`` module).
        
        * You can use ``+dot+`` in your project template filenames,
        specifically so that you can use leading dots in the filename.
        Usually leading dots cause the file to be ignored.  So if you want
        to have new projects contain a ``.cvsignore`` file, you can put a
        ``+dot+cvsignore`` file in your template.
        
        * Relatedly, ``+plus+`` has been added so you can include pluses.
