Description: Taglist generator for findlinks
        ===============================
        
        ``tha.taglist`` generates an html list of svn tags suitable for
        zc.buildout's find-links.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Installation is the normal buildout procedure.
        
        
        
        How it works
        ------------
        
        The script iterates over the ``BASE`` repository as defined in
        tha/taglist/defaults.py.  It first tries to use ``BASE_ON_SERVER``,
        which you can use to define ``file:///svn`` as an alternative base
        when available, which speeds it up on the server and which also makes
        it usable for every user account.  It has a blacklist of directories
        it won't interate into.  Every directory is examined for "stop
        indicators" like ``setup.py`` that indicate that there aren't any
        useful tag directories further down. See defaults.py for documentation
        on how to override it in your buildout.
        
        If a ``tags/`` directory is found an entry in the packages.html is
        added with:
        
        * The tag ('1.0'). We do a regex search for the version in the
        setup.py. If found and if it doesn't match the tag, we emit a
        warning.
        
        * The svn url.
        
        * The name that is extracted (with a regex) from the setup.py.
        
        You can start the script with '-v' or '-vv' for more verbose logging.

        TODO
        ====
        
        * Option: check the name and version for each tagged package by
        finding the setup.py, running it and asking for its name and
        version instead of doing a regex search. For this you need a full
        checkout of the whole repository instead of just a temporary
        checkout of a setup.py file.
