Changelog for tha.taglist
=========================

1.1 (2009-07-17)
----------------

- Writing to tempfile again and shutil.move()-ing it in place.  See if that
  helps with file permissions.  Writing directly gave me permission errors in
  the post-commit hook that I didn't get with the tempfile still enabled.
  [reinout] 


1.0 (2009-06-24)
----------------

- Generating page with a jinja template now.  Instead of yucky string
  replacement.  [reinout]


0.9 (2009-06-24)
----------------

- Fix for 0.8: filtering out non-numeric versions for the list of latest
  versions.  [reinout]


0.8 (2009-06-24)
----------------

- Added listing of latest versions to the bottom of the page.  [reinout]


0.7 (2009-03-03)
----------------

- Small bugfix (reported by Maurits): use shutil.move instead of os.rename as
  the latter doesn't work between two filesystems.  [reinout]

------------------

- Doc update. [reinout]
