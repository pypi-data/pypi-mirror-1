Description: Taglist generator for findlinks
        ===============================
        
        ``tha.taglist`` generates an html list of svn tags suitable for
        zc.buildout's find-links.
        
        This package was originally developed for `The Health Agency
        <http://www.thehealthagency.com>`_.  We're now using an alternative: generate
        the sdist eggs into a pypi-like structure.  See `tha.sdistmaker
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tha.sdistmaker>`_
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Installation is the normal buildout procedure.
        
        Some functionality from older versions (the actual finding of tags in svn) was
        splitted out into a separate library, tha.tagfinder.
        
        
        How it works
        ------------
        
        The script iterates over the ``BASE`` repository as defined in
        tha/taglist/defaults.py.  It first tries to use ``BASE_ON_SERVER``,
        which you can use to define ``file:///svn`` as an alternative base
        when available, which speeds it up on the server and which also makes
        it usable for every user account.  It has a blacklist of directories
        it won't interate into.  Every directory is examined for "stop
        indicators" like ``setup.py`` that indicate that there aren't any
        useful tag directories further down. See defaults.py for documentation
        on how to override it in your buildout.
        
        If a ``tags/`` directory is found an entry in the packages.html is
        added with:
        
        * The tag ('1.0'). We do a regex search for the version in the
        setup.py. If found and if it doesn't match the tag, we emit a
        warning.
        
        * The svn url.
        
        * The name that is extracted (with a regex) from the setup.py.
        
        You can start the script with '-v' or '-vv' for more verbose logging.

        Changelog for tha.taglist
        =========================
        
        1.5 (2009-12-22)
        ----------------
        
        - Documentation update: pointing at tha.sdistmaker as alternative.  And
        cleaned up license, email address etc.
        
        
        1.4 (2009-10-06)
        ----------------
        
        - Re-added BASE_ON_SERVER to BASE url rewriting of found tag urls.  [reinout]
        
        
        1.3 (2009-10-05)
        ----------------
        
        - Fixed BASE/BASE_ON_SERVER bug.  [reinout]
        
        
        1.2.1 (2009-10-05)
        ------------------
        
        - Factored out tag finding code into tha.tagfinder.  [reinout]
        
        
        1.1 (2009-07-17)
        ----------------
        
        - Writing to tempfile again and shutil.move()-ing it in place.  See if that
        helps with file permissions.  Writing directly gave me permission errors in
        the post-commit hook that I didn't get with the tempfile still enabled.

        1.0 (2009-06-24)
        ----------------
        
        - Generating page with a jinja template now.  Instead of yucky string

        ----------------

        0.7 (2009-03-03)
        ----------------
        
        - Small bugfix (reported by Maurits): use shutil.move instead of os.rename as
        the latter doesn't work between two filesystems.  [reinout]
        
        
        0.6.1 (2009-02-26)

        - Added check (regex-based) whether the version in setup.py matches
        the tag. If not, it emits a warning.  [reinout]
        
        
        0.3 (2009-02-25)
        ----------------
        
        - Added TODO.txt

        TODO
        ====
        
        * Option: check the name and version for each tagged package by
        finding the setup.py, running it and asking for its name and
        version instead of doing a regex search. For this you need a full
        checkout of the whole repository instead of just a temporary
        checkout of a setup.py file.
