===================
Django Repositories
===================

Repositories is a simple Django-based app to manage source code repositories.

It is not meant to manage repositories that are only accessed by one person, but for a team of people.

It can:

* Create new repositories
* Manage public or private read access
* Manage user or group authentication and commit access

It can use these version control systems:

* Subversion
* Git
* Mercurial (Not Done: Need help)
* Bazaar (Not Done: Need help)
* Others could be written in to the vcs abstraction

The hosting is done through Apache httpd, as there are hooks in Apache httpd's mod_python and mod_wsgi implementations for external authentication and authorization.
