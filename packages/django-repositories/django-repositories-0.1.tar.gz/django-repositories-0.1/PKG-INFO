        Django Repositories
        ===================
        
        Repositories is a simple Django-based app to manage source code repositories.
        
        It is not meant to manage repositories that are only accessed by one person, but for a team of people.
        
        It can:
        
        * Create new repositories
        * Manage public or private read access
        * Manage user or group authentication and commit access
        
        It can use these version control systems:
        
        * Subversion
        * Git
        * Mercurial (Not Done: Need help)
        * Bazaar (Not Done: Need help)
        * Others could be written in to the vcs abstraction
        
        The hosting is done through Apache httpd, as there are hooks in Apache httpd's mod_python and mod_wsgi implementations for external authentication and authorization.
