Installation
============

To install collective.langMailHost into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:

* When you're reading this you have probably already run 
  ``easy_install collective.langMailHost``. Find out how to install setuptools
  (and EasyInstall) here:
  http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall

* Create a file called ``collective.langMailHost-configure.zcml`` in the
  ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
  should only contain this::

    <include package="collective.langMailHost" />


Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

* Add ``collective.langMailHost`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:

    |    [buildout]
    |    ...
    |    eggs =
    |        ...
    |        collective.langMailHost

* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug:

    |    [instance]
    |    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    |    ...
    |    zcml =
    |        collective.langMailHost # 1
    |        collective.langMailHost-overrides # 2

* Re-run buildout, e.g. with:

    $ ./bin/buildout

You can skip the ZCML slug # 1 if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file, but not # 2.
