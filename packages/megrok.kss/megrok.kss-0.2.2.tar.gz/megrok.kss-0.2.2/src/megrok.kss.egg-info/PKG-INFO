        `Grok <http://grok.zope.org>`_ is a web application framework for Python developers. It is aimed at both
        beginners and very experienced web developers. Grok has an emphasis on agile development.
        Grok is easy and powerful.
        
        **************************
        Kinetic Style Sheets (KSS)
        **************************
        
        KSS is an Ajax framework that allows UI development without writing any
        Javascript. It uses style sheets with CSS-compliant syntax to declare and bind
        dynamic behaviors in the browser. The engine supports a set of generic DOM-like
        commands; they are computed on the server and sent back to manipulate the HTML
        page.
        
        What is KSS?
        ************
        
        KSS is an AJAX framework. KSS has both a client-side Javascript library and
        server-side support.
        
        The client-side Javascript library needs to be included in your page. It
        fetches Kinetic style sheets from the server, parses them and binds a set of
        actions to browser events and/or page elements. It is clean Javascript code that
        can peacefully coexist with other clean Javascript libraries like JQuery or
        ExtJS. It is about 100k in production mode. You can integrate your own
        Javascript code by using its extension mechanism through plugins.
        
        Server-side code is currently available for Zope (2 and 3, which includes
        Plone and Grok).
        
        The Javascript client-side code can be used independently of existing
        server-side support. In other words, it is usable on platforms where we have
        not built server-side support like PHP, Ruby or Java.

        megrok.kss - 0.2  Released 2008-08-18
        
        - Fixes for 0.13 compatibility
        [gotcha]
        
        - To simplify the usage of KSS in Grok we renamed the `KSSActions` class
        to `KSS`, which is more in line with the JSON and WSGI extensions. In
        Grok, you apply KSS on a view rather than a content object.
        Use: grok.view(MyViewClass) to register it.
