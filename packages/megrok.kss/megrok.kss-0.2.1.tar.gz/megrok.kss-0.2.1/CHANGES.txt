Changelog for megrok.kss
------------------------

    (name of developer listed in brackets)

megrok.kss - 0.2.1 Released 2008-12-29

    - Fixes for compatibility with security-patched grok versions
      (0.14.1, 0.13.1, 0.12.2)
      [ulif]

megrok.kss - 0.2  Released 2008-08-18

    - Fixes for 0.13 compatibility
      [gotcha]

    - To simplify the usage of KSS in Grok we renamed the `KSSActions` class
      to `KSS`, which is more in line with the JSON and WSGI extensions. In
      Grok, you apply KSS on a view rather than a content object.
      Use: grok.view(MyViewClass) to register it.
