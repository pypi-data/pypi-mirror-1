Description: minixsv is a lightweight XML schema validator written in "pure" Python
        Currently a subset of the XML schema standard is supported
        minixsv is based on genxmlif, a generic XML interface class,
        which currently supports minidom, elementtree or 4DOM/pyXML as XML parser
        Other parsers can be adapted by implementing an appropriate derived interface class
