Description: pyjack
        ======
        
        The ``pyjack`` contains two basic functions -- ``pyjack.connect`` and ``pyjack.disconnect`` -- which allow you to connect to
        other functions and methods.  This can be used to:
        
        - *attach observers or callbacks to functions/methods*:
        Connect a callback 'observer' functions to be called whenever the pyjacked function is called.  The callback is called with both the original arguments and the ``pyjacked`` function.
        
        - *filter function/method arguments*:
        A filter function can be provided which is used to alter the arguments passed to the function.
        
        - *entirely replace existing function/method with your own function/method*:
        ``pyjack`` allows you to 'block' the original function being called.  In essence, this allows you to use ``pyjack`` to replace a function with your own callback (or filter) function.
        
        
        
        
        
        Simple Example: Adding Callbacks To Functions
        ---------------------------------------------
        
        ``pyjack`` can be used to connect callbacks to functions::
        
        import pyjack
        
        def max_callback(input, pyjack_org_fn):
        print 'Someone is trying to max ' + str(input)
        print 'Also got some pyjack_org_fn ' + str(pyjack_org_fn)
        
        pyjack.connect(max, callback = max_callback, filter = None, block = False)
        
        print max([10, 20])
        
        # When you are done, disconnect and everything is back to normal ...
        pyjack.disconnect(max, callback = max_callback, filter = None, block = False)
