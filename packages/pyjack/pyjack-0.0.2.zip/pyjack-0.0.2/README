pyjack
======

The ``pyjack`` contains two basic functions -- ``pyjack.connect`` and ``pyjack.disconnect`` -- which allow you to connect to 
other functions and methods.  This can be used to: 

- *attach observers or callbacks to functions/methods*:
  Connect a callback 'observer' functions to be called whenever the pyjacked function is called.  The callback is called with both the original arguments and the ``pyjacked`` function. 

- *filter function/method arguments*:
  A filter function can be provided which is used to alter the arguments passed to the function. 

- *entirely replace existing function/method with your own function/method*:
  ``pyjack`` allows you to 'block' the original function being called.  In essence, this allows you to use ``pyjack`` to replace a function with your own callback (or filter) function. 


 
 
 
Simple Example: Adding Callbacks To Functions
---------------------------------------------

``pyjack`` can be used to connect callbacks to functions::

  import pyjack

  def max_callback(input, pyjack_org_fn):
      print 'Someone is trying to max ' + str(input)
      print 'Also got some pyjack_org_fn ' + str(pyjack_org_fn)
    
  pyjack.connect(max, callback = max_callback, filter = None, block = False)

  print max([10, 20])
 
  # When you are done, disconnect and everything is back to normal ... 
  pyjack.disconnect(max, callback = max_callback, filter = None, block = False)
