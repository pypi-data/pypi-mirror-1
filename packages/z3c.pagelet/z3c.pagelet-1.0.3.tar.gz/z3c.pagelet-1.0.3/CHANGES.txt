1.0.3 (2009-02-27)
------------------

* Allow use of ``z3c.pt`` using ``z3c.ptcompat`` compatibility layer.

* Add support for context-specific layout and content template lookup,
  using (view, request, context) discriminator. This is compatible with
  context-specific templates introduced in z3c.template 1.2.0. 

* Don't do rendering in pagelet's __call__ method when request is a redirection.

* Add sphinx-based HTML documentation building part to the buildout.


1.0.2 (2008-01-21)
------------------

* Added a `form.zcml` which can be included to have a template for
  ``PageletAddForm``, ``PageletEditForm`` and ``PageletDisplayForm``.


1.0.1 (2007-10-08)
------------------

* Added ``update()`` and ``render()`` method to ``IPagelet`` which was
  not specified but used.

* Fixed a infinite recursion bug when a layout template was registered for "*"
  but no content template was registered for a pagelet.
