# Daterange

Like `xrange()`, but for `datetime` objects.

## Example Usage

    >>> import datetime
    >>> start = datetime.date(2009, 6, 21)

    >>> g1 = daterange(start)
    >>> g1.next()
    datetime.date(2009, 6, 21)
    >>> g1.next()
    datetime.date(2009, 6, 22)
    >>> g1.next()
    datetime.date(2009, 6, 23)
    >>> g1.next()
    datetime.date(2009, 6, 24)
    >>> g1.next()
    datetime.date(2009, 6, 25)
    >>> g1.next()
    datetime.date(2009, 6, 26)

    >>> g2 = daterange(start, to=datetime.date(2009, 6, 25))
    >>> g2.next()
    datetime.date(2009, 6, 21)
    >>> g2.next()
    datetime.date(2009, 6, 22)
    >>> g2.next()
    datetime.date(2009, 6, 23)
    >>> g2.next()
    datetime.date(2009, 6, 24)
    >>> g2.next()
    datetime.date(2009, 6, 25)
    >>> g2.next()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    StopIteration

    >>> g3 = daterange(start, step='2 days')
    >>> g3.next()
    datetime.date(2009, 6, 21)
    >>> g3.next()
    datetime.date(2009, 6, 23)
    >>> g3.next()
    datetime.date(2009, 6, 25)
    >>> g3.next()
    datetime.date(2009, 6, 27)

    >>> g4 = daterange(start, to=datetime.date(2009, 6, 25), step='2 days')
    >>> g4.next()
    datetime.date(2009, 6, 21)
    >>> g4.next()
    datetime.date(2009, 6, 23)
    >>> g4.next()
    datetime.date(2009, 6, 25)
    >>> g4.next()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    StopIteration
