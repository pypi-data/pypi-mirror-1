This project is an attempt to develop a fully Python-based interface
to the AFS APIs. A lot of the structure is based on the Perl AFS
module (http://search.cpan.org/~nog/AFS-2.6.1), but this will
hopefully be a bit more Pythonic in its interface.

The goal is essentially to implement the full set of "high-level" APIs
provided by the Perl modules in a combination of Python and
Cython. This will typically involve a fairly simple wrapping of the C
API in a Cython module (e.g. afs._pts), and then a higher-level
wrapping of that Cython module in pure Python (e.g. afs.pts).

I am depending on patches from other people, beacuse I will not finish
this on my own. I think I've established enough of the structure that
others can see what I want the structure to look like.

Please be sure to sign off on your patches.
