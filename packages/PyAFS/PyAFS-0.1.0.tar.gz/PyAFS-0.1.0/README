Installing PyAFS
================

To install PyAFS, you will first need to install Cython_. It's always
a good idea to install Cython through your package manager, if
possible. Your system's Cython package may be named ``cython`` or
``cython-py25``. If your package manager doesn't have a package for
Cython, or if you wish to install Cython by hand anyway, you can do so
by running::

  $ easy_install Cython

Once you've done that, to install PyAFS globally, run::

  $ python setup.py install

If you want to build PyAFS without installing it globally, you may
want to run::

  $ python setup.py build_ext --inplace

which will build the C extensions in place next to their source,
allowing you to import the various modules, so long as your current
working directory is the root of the PyAFS source tree.

Alternatively, PyHesiod has been packaged for Debian and Ubuntu. To
build the Debian package of the latest release, run::

  $ git checkout debian
  $ git buildpackage
  $ sudo debi

You will need the devscripts and git-buildpackage packages installed,
as well as this package's build dependencies (cdbs, debhelper,
python-all-dev, python-support, python-pyrex, python-setuptools,
libopenafs-dev).
