      <p>One of the great advantage of WSGI is that it&#8217;s possible to combine multiple
applications together easily.  This document explains multiple ways to avoid
repeating oneself and get the best out of WSGI.</p>
<div class="section" id="reusable-or-just-modular">
<h3>Reusable or just Modular?</h3>
<p>The ultimative reusable application that runs in every environment is more or
less a fantasy.  Because different situations require different tools or
different developers have different likes and dislikes there will be never the
situation where you can drop <cite>$randomapplication</cite> into an unaltered existing
application.</p>
<p>The first question you have to ask yourself is if you want to have a reusable
application or just a modular one.  The difference is that a reusable
application can be used outside of a master application.  Sounds confusing, so
let&#8217;s look at an example situation.</p>
<p>Many applications are devided into multiple modules.  For example if you have
a portal software you probably have modules like these:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><cite>auth</cite> &#8211; a module that handles authentication and authorization,
user sessions and all that stuff.</li>
<li><cite>wiki</cite> &#8211; maybe you run a wiki there</li>
<li><cite>forum</cite> &#8211; and a forum</li>
<li><cite>planet</cite> &#8211; and probably a planet application</li>
<li><cite>api</cite> &#8211; you&#8217;re a web 2.0 guy, so there is an API too</li>
</ul>
<p>That means you have five components in total and most likely they will depend
on each other.  So the forum, wiki and planet will use the session managed by
the auth module, the wiki will probably link to the forum and vice versa.
That&#8217;s a situation where it makes more trouble keeping the applications
reusable than just modular.</p>
<p>Modular applications are a lot easier because they can depend on each other
and share information.  For example our portal application from above can
use the same database, template engine system, url routing, request dispatching
and much more.</p>
<p>For that situation we can use a high level abstraction which does not work
on the WSGI layer.  That&#8217;s less flexible but easier to maintain and to extend.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="modular-applications">
<h3>Modular Applications</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s concentrate on modular applications first.  A very popular web
application developed in Python that is modular is trac.  It is based on
a component system inspired by <cite>zope.interface</cite>.  Zine on the other
hand uses signals and a registration system to combine multiple separate
components into one big application.  But you don&#8217;t have to go that far.
For most applications it&#8217;s enough to have a list of known modules somewhere
and import all the required stuff on startup.</p>
<p>The important design decision you have to think about when starting the
development of the application is if you want to support multiple instances
of the application or if the application takes over the whole interpreter.</p>
<p>A very common approach is storing an object in a module that contains the
configuration for the application.  This is for example what the Django
framework does.  The huge advantage of this approach is, that it&#8217;s very
easy to implement and straightforward to use.  The downside is that due to
the fact that the modules are singletons, it&#8217;s impossible to run two separate
Django applications in the same Python interpreter.  This isn&#8217;t necessarily
a bad thing but something you have to decide on a per-application basis.</p>
<p>For example trac is designed to support multiple trac installations in the
same Python interpreter.  This allows scripts to connect to multiple trac
installations at the same time and syncronize data, or run multiple trac
web interfaces in the exact same Python interpreter and share some resources
all those installations have in common.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-setup-phase">
<h4>The Setup Phase</h4>
<p>Python web applications are long term processes.  They are initialized when
the interpreter starts up and listen for connections until something tells
the application to shut down again.  This means that unlike in CGI programming
you have a setup phase where the application doesn&#8217;t have access to an HTTP
request but can do expensive stuff you don&#8217;t want to do every request.</p>
<p>In TextPress for example there is a class called <cite>TextPress</cite> which when
instanciated with the path to the folder holding the configuration and some
other files like binary data, will load all the plugins for this textpress
environment.  Trac on the other hand has a central object called the trac
<cite>Environment</cite> which does roughly the same.</p>
<p>But if you don&#8217;t need multiple installations in the same process you don&#8217;t
have to create a class for your application but provide a function to
configure the application.</p>
<p>For example you could have a module called <cite>yourapplication.core</cite> that
provides a <cite>wsgi_app</cite> and a <cite>setup</cite> function.  In your runner file (for
example the <cite>yourapplication.fcgi</cite>) you call setup first and pass the
<cite>wsgi_app</cite> to the real application then:</p>
<div class="syntax"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">yourapplication</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">core</span>
<span class="n">core</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">setup</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;/path/to/your/application/instance&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">serve</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">core</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">wsgi_app</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This setup function then looks up all the modules it thinks it should load.
Django for example does something very similar to that.  In the configuration
there is a list of import paths to applications, Django should load.</p>
<p>A possible <cite>setup</cite> function that assambles an application from multiple small
parts looks like this in pseudocode:</p>
<div class="syntax"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">werkzeug</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">module_name</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">werkzeug.routing</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Map</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">werkzeug.exceptions</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">HTTPException</span>

<span class="n">config</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Configuration</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">url_map</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Map</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">modules</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">setup</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">instance_path</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">config</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">load</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">instance_path</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">module_name</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">config</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;enabled_modules&#39;</span><span class="p">]:</span>
        <span class="n">module</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">import_string</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">module_name</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">url_rule</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">module</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">url_rules</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="n">url_map</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">url_rule</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="n">modules</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">module</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>When called this function looks at the <cite>enabled_modules</cite> list from the
configuration (probably a YAML file) and goes through all of them.  Each
module is loaded and the <cite>url_rules</cite> from that module are added to the
global <cite>url_map</cite>.</p>
<p>Imagine you have a <cite>yourapplication.forum</cite>.  The <cite>__init__.py</cite> would then
look like this:</p>
<div class="syntax"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">werkzeug</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Rule</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Submount</span>

<span class="n">url_rules</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">Submount</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;/forum&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span>
    <span class="n">Rule</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;/&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">endpoint</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#39;yourapplication.forum.views.index&#39;</span><span class="p">),</span>
    <span class="n">Rule</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;/&lt;slug&gt;/&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">endpoint</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#39;yourapplication.forum.views.forum&#39;</span><span class="p">),</span>
    <span class="n">Rule</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;/&lt;slug&gt;/&lt;int:topic_id&gt;&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
         <span class="n">endpoint</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#39;yourapplication.forum.views.topic&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">])]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>And so forth.  Of course you can abbreviate the endpoints somehow or make
the endpoints even implicit but you get the idea.</p>
<p>Depending on what your application does it makes sense to use the setup
function to register database migrations, database tables/schemas, signals
and much more.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-request-phase">
<h4>The Request Phase</h4>
<p>The wsgi application for the particular setup from above could look like
this:</p>
<div class="syntax"><pre><span class="nd">@Request</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">application</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">wsgi_app</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">request</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">adapter</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">url_map</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">bind_to_environ</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">request</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">try</span><span class="p">:</span>
