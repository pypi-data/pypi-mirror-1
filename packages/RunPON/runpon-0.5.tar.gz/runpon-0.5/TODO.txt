Guess what?  RunPON is still veeery long from being a decent program. :-)

Ideas, thoughts and other dangerous things:

[general]
- an installer is required.
- split it into modules/packages.
- improve the configuration GUI.
- the GtkSpinButton(s) values in the GUI are not updated until the user
  press ENTER (only manually writining the value - using the arrows
  works as expected).
- the timer runs as soon as the user presses the "on" button; probably
  there should be the option to start/reset the counter when the
  interface is actually up.
- is there a way to automatically detect the interface?
- how to check the interface without polling?
- the two timers (one to update the counter, and the other to periodically
  check the interface) are started at the same time, but obviously the
  'pon' script is run whenever the user wants.
  This means that the check on the interface is not run every X seconds
  since the "on" button was pressed, but every X seconds since the
  applet was running.  Maybe not a big deal, but not very nice.
- time.strftime is probably not a sound choice to display the time,
  and there are for sure better modules usable to create a timer.
- become generic enough to be easily used to run non-network related things.
- the whole code is not exactly pretty. :-)
- communicate with dbus?
- translations.


[Window]
- an icon is needed.


[Gnome panel applet]
- the GNOME_RunPON.server could be improved.  We need an icon, btw...


[Tray icon]
- it would be cool to update the "icon" with the running time.
- how to show a warning of some kind, if there's a problem?
