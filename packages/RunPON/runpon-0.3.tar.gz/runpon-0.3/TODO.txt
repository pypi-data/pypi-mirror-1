Guess what?  RunPON is still very long from being a decent program. :-)

Ideas, thoughts and other dangerous things:

[general]
- an installer is required.
- a configuration file is needed; along with it, a configuration interface
  would be wonderful.
- ability to deactivate the interface check.
- the timer runs as soon as the user presses the "on" button; probably
  there should be the option to start/reset the counter when the
  interface is actually up.
- is there a way to automatically detect the interface?
- how to check the interface without polling?
- the two timers (one to update the counter, and the other to periodically
  check the interface) are started at the same time, but obviously the
  'pon' script is run whenever the user wants.
  This means that the check on the interface is not run every X seconds
  since the "on" button was pressed, but every X seconds since the
  applet was running.  Maybe not a big deal, but not very nice.
- put, in the right click menu, a list of preconfigured set of scripts
  to run (and other options - and an "about" button).
- time.strftime is probably not a sound choice to display the time,
  and there are for sure better modules usable to create a timer.
- become generic enough to be easily used to run non-network related things.
- debug 'print's still here and there.
- the whole code is not exactly pretty. :-)
- translations.


[Window]
- an icon is needed.


[Gnome panel applet]
- the GNOME_RunPON.server could be improved.  We need an icon, btw...
- the right-click menu is not integrated with the main one, and we
  need to deactivate some entries accordingly to the running status.


[Tray icon]
- it would be cool to update the "icon" with the running time.
- how to show a warning of some kind, if there's a problem?
