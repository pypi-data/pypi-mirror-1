Description: 
        PyUblasExt is a companion to PyUblas and exposes a variety of useful additions to PyUblas:
        
        * A cross-language "operator" class for building matrix-free algorithms
        * CG and BiCGSTAB linear solvers that use this operator class
        * An `ARPACK <http://mathema.tician.de/software/arpack>`_ interface that also uses this operator class
        * An UMFPACK interface for PyUblas's sparse matrices
        * An interface to the `DASKR <http://www.netlib.org/ode/>` ODE solver.
