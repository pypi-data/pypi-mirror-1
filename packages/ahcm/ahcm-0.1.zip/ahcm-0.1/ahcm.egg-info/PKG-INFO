Description: ahcm apply mypatch /prj/foo
        ahcm apply blah.txt foo.txt /prj/foo
        
        - Copy all files under directory mypatch over corresponding files in
        /prj/foo. Do the same for blah.txt and foo.txt
        If file doesn't exist under target dir, it's NOT created.
        
        Also other simple but handy "dirty" CM operations are supported for those unmanaged situations. ;-)
