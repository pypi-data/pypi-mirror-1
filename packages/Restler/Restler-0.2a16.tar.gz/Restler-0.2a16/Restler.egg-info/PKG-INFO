Description: Restler is a controller for Pylons projects that provides a set of default
        RESTful actions that can be overridden as needed. It also handles database
        connectivity as long as a few simple rules are followed (0.1 only; not
        ported to 0.2 yet).
        
        The Restler project is hosted at Google Code. Please see
        http://code.google.com/p/restler/ for more details, documentation, etc.
        
        The latest development version can be found here:

        Restler was originally extracted from the byCycle bicycle trip planner
        (http://bycycle.org).
