        ===========
        
        Wheeljack is an automated build system. It's main focus is
        simplicity. Especially regarding work needed to setup the system or a
        new project. To satisfy this requirement it handles configuration
        through a web interface. This means that setting up a new project
        should be a matter of seconds.
        
        Supported version control systems
        =================================
        
        Currently Wheeljack supports Bazaar_ and Subversion only. This is not
        a hard requirement for the software. Support for other version control
        systems can be added.

        Installation
        ============
        
        Wheeljack can be installed use one of two methods. The first is to
        setup everything yourself. The other is to use the provided
        installation template. People unfamiliar with Django are probably best
        off with an installation using the template. Read the next section on
        how to use this template. The rest of this section assumes a certain
        familiarity with Django.
        
        To use Wheeljack you can create a Django project. Wheeljack ships with
        a pre-configured project you can use to import or copy from. The
        application itself is a normal Django app. The already setup project
        can be found under the `src/wheeljack/project` directory.
        
        You can install the code by running `python2.5 setup.py`. This will
        also create a script called `wheeljack`. That script is the build
        slave.
        
        The build slave needs to be executed periodically. You could set it up
        to run uninterrupted or from a cron job. Please look at the options it
        supports by executing::
        
        $ wheeljack --help
        
        
        Installing Wheeljack using the template
        =======================================
        
        To easiest way to get started is to follow along with the instructions
        in this guide.
        
        Download the `Wheeljack installation template`__. After extracting the
        archive you need to edit a few files.
        
        __ http://launchpad.net/wheeljack/trunk/0.2/+download/wheeljack-install.tgz
        
        Open a terminal and execute the following line from within the
        directory that contains `buildout.cfg`::
        
        $ python2.5 bootstrap.py
        
        This will create a new script which will start with the
        installation. The installation can be ran as a normal system user and
        will not try to install anything outside of it's current directory.
        
        $ ./bin/buildout
        
        Within the directory called `autobot` there is a file named
        `settings.py`. Open this file and change the settings for
        `EMAIL_HOST`, `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`, `ADMINS`, `TIME_ZONE`,
        `LANGUAGE_CODE`, `BUILDER_USER` and `BUILDER_PASSWORD`. The last two
        items should be set to the user you will create in the next section.
        
        Create an initial database which will store the project info. This
        will ask you to create a new admin user. Answer yes to this.
        
        $ ./bin/django syncdb
        
        Now you are ready to start Wheeljack. This example configuration uses
        Supervisord to manage it's processes. Run the following command to
        start both a builder and the web server.
        
        $ ./bin/supervisord -c etc/supervisord.conf
        
        The webserver is automatically started at port 8000. This can be
        changed from the `etc/supervisord.conf` file.
        
        Now you can visit the Wheeljack-interface_. If everything works
        O.K. there is only one thing left to do. Please reopen
        `settings.py`. Remove or comment the line that says `DEBUG = True`.

        0.4 - February 14 2009
        ======================
        
        - A builder is started directly by forcing a build of a project. This
        mean you don't have to wait until a scheduled build takes place.
        
        - Made it possible to specify the configuration as an alternative to
        entering user name and password for the `wheeljack` command.
        
        - Fixed a problem where a forced build of a wrongly configured
        repository would crash the builder.
        
        - A notification is send when a build starts working again (after at
        least one failed build).
        
        - Added a migration system (South) for easier upgrading between
        versions.
        
        0.3 - January 04 2009
        =====================
        
        - The builder no longer crashes when the server is not available.
        
        - Switched to Paster for the template based deployment. This is a much
        better server than the default Django development server for
        production use.
        
        - Fixed an error that caused the builder to crash when terminating a
        hung build.
        
        - The build info for a project is now updated during a build. This
        means that you can actually watch the build in progress.
        
        0.2 - January 01 2009
        =====================
        
        - Moved the base template to the project. This makes it easier to
        override it for specific installations.
        
        - Added support for Subversion.
        
        - Changes to the project's settings will trigger a build regardless of
        any updates to the version control system.
        
        - Made it possible to force a build from the project detail screen.
        
        0.1 - First release
        ===================
        
        - Initial release of Wheeljack.
