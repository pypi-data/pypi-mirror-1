Description
===========

Wheeljack is an automated build system. It's main focus is
simplicity. Especially regarding work needed to setup the system or a
new project. To satisfy this requirement it handles configuration
through a web interface. This means that setting up a new project
should be a matter of seconds.

Supported version control systems
=================================

Currently Wheeljack supports Bazaar_ and Subversion only. This is not
a hard requirement for the software. Support for other version control
systems can be added.
