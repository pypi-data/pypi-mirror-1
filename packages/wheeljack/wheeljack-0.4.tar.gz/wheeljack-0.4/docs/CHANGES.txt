0.4 - February 14 2009
======================

- A builder is started directly by forcing a build of a project. This
  mean you don't have to wait until a scheduled build takes place.

- Made it possible to specify the configuration as an alternative to
  entering user name and password for the `wheeljack` command.

- Fixed a problem where a forced build of a wrongly configured
  repository would crash the builder.

- A notification is send when a build starts working again (after at
  least one failed build).

- Added a migration system (South) for easier upgrading between
  versions.

0.3 - January 04 2009
=====================

- The builder no longer crashes when the server is not available.

- Switched to Paster for the template based deployment. This is a much
  better server than the default Django development server for
  production use.

- Fixed an error that caused the builder to crash when terminating a
  hung build.

- The build info for a project is now updated during a build. This
  means that you can actually watch the build in progress.

0.2 - January 01 2009
=====================

- Moved the base template to the project. This makes it easier to
  override it for specific installations.

- Added support for Subversion.

- Changes to the project's settings will trigger a build regardless of
  any updates to the version control system.

- Made it possible to force a build from the project detail screen.

0.1 - First release
===================

- Initial release of Wheeljack.
