        ===========
        
        Wheeljack is an automated build system. It's main focus is
        simplicity. Especially regarding work needed to setup the system or a
        new project. To satisfy this requirement it handles configuration
        through a web interface. This means that setting up a new project
        should be a matter of seconds.
        
        Supported version control systems
        =================================
        
        Currently Wheeljack supports Bazaar_ and Subversion only. This is not
        a hard requirement for the software. Support for other version control
        systems can be added.

        Installation
        ============
        
        Wheeljack can be installed use one of two methods. The first is to
        setup everything yourself. The other is to use the provided
        installation template. People unfamiliar with Django are probably best
        off with an installation using the template. Read the next section on
        how to use this template. The rest of this section assumes a certain
        familiarity with Django.
        
        To use Wheeljack you can create a Django project. Wheeljack ships with
        a pre-configured project you can use to import or copy from. The
        application itself is a normal Django app. The already setup project
        can be found under the `src/wheeljack/project` directory.
        
        You can install the code by running `python2.5 setup.py`. This will
        also create a script called `wheeljack`. That script is the build
        slave.
        
        The build slave needs to be executed periodically. You could set it up
        to run uninterrupted or from a cron job. Please look at the options it
        supports by executing::
        
        $ wheeljack --help
        
        
        Installing Wheeljack using the template
        =======================================
        
        To easiest way to get started is to follow along with the instructions
        in this guide.
        
        Download the `Wheeljack installation template`__. After extracting the
        archive you need to edit a few files.
        
        __ http://launchpad.net/wheeljack/trunk/0.2/+download/wheeljack-install.tgz
        
        Open a terminal and execute the following line from within the
        directory that contains `buildout.cfg`::
        
        $ python2.5 bootstrap.py
        
        This will create a new script which will start with the
        installation. The installation can be ran as a normal system user and
        will not try to install anything outside of it's current directory.
        
        $ ./bin/buildout
        
        Within the directory called `autobot` there is a file named
        `settings.py`. Open this file and change the settings for
        `EMAIL_HOST`, `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`, `ADMINS`, `TIME_ZONE` and
        `LANGUAGE_CODE`.
        
        Create an initial database which will store the project info. This will ask you to create a new admin user. Answer yes to this.
        
        $ ./bin/django syncdb
        
        Edit `etc/supervisord.conf` and change the user and password options
        to ones you entered earlier.
        
        Now you are ready to start Wheeljack. This example configuration uses
        Supervisord to manage it's processes. Run the following command to
        start both a builder and the web server.
        
        $ ./bin/supervisord -c etc/supervisord.conf
        
        The webserver is automatically started at port 8000. This can be
        changed from the `etc/supervisord.conf` file.
        
        Now you can visit the Wheeljack-interface_. If everything works O.K. there is only one thing left to do. Please reopen `settings.py`. Remove or comment the line that says `DEBUG = True`.
