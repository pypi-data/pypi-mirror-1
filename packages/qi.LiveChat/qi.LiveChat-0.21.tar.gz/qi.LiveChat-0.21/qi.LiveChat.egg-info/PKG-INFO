        =========================
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        qi.LiveChat is a simple ajax chat product for plone.
        
        It requires an external utility that handles message keeping. At the moment only an xmlrpc server is provided. However it is very easy to add other implementations in order to use sql or use a logging facility.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        1) Using buildout
        Add qi.LiveChat to your eggs and zcml sections. Installation can also add a script called "livechat_server" to your buildout's bin directory (see "Usage"). In order to do that
        add the following section to your buildout
        
        [scripts]
        recipe = zc.recipe.egg
        eggs = qi.LiveChat
        
        and do not forget to add scripts to the parts list.
        
        2) Without buildout
        This package is an egg, if you don't use buildout put it in INSTANCE/lib/python and add a file named qi.LiveChat-configure.zcml in INSTANCE/etc/package-includes with the following line:
        
        <include package="qi.LiveChat" file="configure.zcml" />
        
        You will of course need to run the qi.LiveChat/qi/LiveChat/server/xmlrpcServer.py script manually.
        
        Go to portal quick installer and install qi.LiveChat.
        Add a chat room and chat away!
        
        Usage
        -----
        In order to use the provided xmlrpc message keeper you have to run the qi.LiveChat/qi/LiveChat/server/xmlrpcServer.py script. If you used buildout and followed the directions above, there should exist a link named livechat_server provided for convenience inside your buildout's bin folder.
