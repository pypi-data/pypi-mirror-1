Description: 
        django-tracking is a simple attempt at keeping track of visitors to your
        Django-powered Web site.
        
        Features:
        
        - Tracks the following information about your visitors:
        - Session key
        - IP address
        - User agent
        - Whether or not they are a registered user and logged in
        - Where they came from (http-referer)
        - What page on your site they last visited
        - How many pages on your site they have visited
        - Allows user-agent filtering for visitor tracking
        - Automatic clean-up of old visitor records
        - Can ban certain IP addresses, rendering the site useless to visitors
        from those IP's (great for stopping spam)
        - The ability to have a live feed of active users on your website
        - Template tags to:
        - display how many active users there are on your site
        - determine how many active users are on the same page within your site
