Description: A scheduling system for django.
        
        Instead of a traditional scheduler which has a main loop, usually in a thread, which polls for scheduled tasks this scheduler's polls are triggered by each new request. This way scheduled events are fired as often as needed to retrieve new data that may be needed for local content adjustment without the overhead of another thread and polling loop.
