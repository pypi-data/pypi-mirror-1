"""Rigorous IEEE 754 standard functions module

Given the fact that the math module of Python doesn't provide standard
functions totally conformant with IEEE 754, we implement ourselves a conformant
one.

It was developed in CIn/UFPE (Brazil) by Rafael Menezes Barreto
<rmb3@cin.ufpe.br, rafaelbarreto87@gmail.com> as part of the IntPy package and
it's free software.
