    Requirements
        
        Requires Plone 3.x
        
    Using AnonymousCommenting
        
        Install the AnonymousCommenting package through Plone's Add/Remove
        Products page. AnonymousCommenting will change Plone's security
        settings to allow anonymous users to add comments to site content. It
        will also change the comment form to allow users to enter their own
        names, defaulting to the logged in user's name.
