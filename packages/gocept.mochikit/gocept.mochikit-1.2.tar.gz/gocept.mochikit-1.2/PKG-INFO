        gocept.mochikit integrates MochiKit (http://mochikit.com) into Zope 3. Send
        questions to Christian Zagrodnick <cz@gocept.com>.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        To use gocept.mochikit you need to add the following to your package
        configuration (ZCML)::
        
        <include package="gocept.mochikit" />
        
        This provides several resource libraries using the `zc.resourcelibrary`
        package. In a page template you use::
        
        <tal:replace replace="resource_library:mochikit" />
        
        This will automatically load the main MochiKit file in its packed variant.
        There are several additional MochiKit files which are not included in the
        libarary above:
        
        * mochikit.DragAndDrop
        * mochikit.Controls
        * mochikit.MockDOM
        * mochikit.Selector
        * mochikit.Test
        
        You use those like this::
        
        <tal:replace replace="resource_library:mochikit.DragAndDrop" />
        
        Unpacked Variant
        ================
        
        If you need to debug it's often easier to use the plain and unpacked MochiKit
        variant. To use you load the package like this::
        
        <include package="gocept.mochikit" file="unpacked" />
