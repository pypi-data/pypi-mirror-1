        gocept.mochikit
        ===============
        
        gocept.mochikit integrates MochiKit (http://mochikit.com) into Zope 2 and
        Zope 3. Send questions to Christian Zagrodnick <cz@gocept.com>.
        
        
        Usage (Zope 3)
        ==============
        
        To use gocept.mochikit you need to add the following to your package
        configuration (ZCML)::
        
        <include package="gocept.mochikit" />
        
        This provides several resource libraries using the `zc.resourcelibrary`
        package. In a page template you use::
        
        <tal:replace replace="resource_library:mochikit" />
        
        This will automatically load the main MochiKit file in its packed variant.
        There are several additional MochiKit files which are not included in the
        libarary above:
        
        * mochikit.DragAndDrop
        * mochikit.Controls
        * mochikit.MockDOM
        * mochikit.Selector
        * mochikit.Test
        
        You use those like this::
        
        <tal:replace replace="resource_library:mochikit.DragAndDrop" />
        
        Unpacked Variant
        ----------------
        
        If you need to debug it's often easier to use the plain and unpacked MochiKit
        variant. To use you load the package like this::
        
        <include package="gocept.mochikit" file="unpacked" />
        
        
        Usage (Zope 2)
        ==============
        
        To use gocept.mochikit in Zope 2 you need to add the following to your package
        configuration (ZCML)::
        
        <include package="gocept.mochikit" file="zope2.zcml" />
        
        This provides the packed version of MochiKit, so in your HTML template you
        need to include the following::
        
        <script
        type="text/javascript"
        src="++resource++gocept.mochikit/MochiKit.js">
        </script>
