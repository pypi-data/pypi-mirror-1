Change Log for PLIB Version 0.3

:Author:        Peter A. Donis

Version 0.3
-----------

- Added ``__version__`` variable to the
  top-level ``plib`` namespace. All of the
  example programs now use the plib version
  as their version number by importing this
  variable.

- Added ``PPrefsDialog`` to ``PLIB.GUI``: a
  preferences dialog that automatically builds
  its interface from a ``PIniFile``. Added a
  preferences dialog to the ``scrips-edit``
  example program to demonstrate this
  functionality.

- Added ``specs`` module to ``PLIB.GUI`` to provide
  helper variables and functions for specifying
  GUI layouts. The ``PPrefsDialog`` class above
  uses this module, and the ``pyidserver-gui.py``
  example program is also modified to use this
  functionality.

- Added ``clientwrap`` class field to ``PTopWindow``
  to automatically size the window to fit its
  client widget; this is now the default behavior.

- Added ``SIGNAL_CLOSING`` signal in ``PLIB.GUI``
  to allow notification when window has accepted
  a close but has not yet closed.

- Moved the ``ModuleProxy`` class from
  ``PLIB.CLASSES`` to ``PLIB.UTILS``, since the
  latter is intended to be closer to the 'root'
  of the dependency tree.

- Added the ``dotted_import`` function to
  ``PLIB.STDLIB`` for convenience when using the
  ``__import__`` builtin with dotted names (the
  code for this function originally came from
  the Python 2.6 documentation).

- Moved the ``options`` module from ``PLIB.UTILS``
  to ``PLIB.STDLIB`` since it basically wraps
  the standard library ``optparse`` module.

- Added the ``version`` module to ``PLIB.UTILS``,
  providing some extensions of the Python
  distutils version number functionality. Also
  added a doctest for this module.

- Added support in ``PLIB.XML`` for manually
  controlling the XML declaration and doctype
  string during serialization.

- The protocol and port number controls in the
  ``pyidserver-gui.py`` example are now disabled
  if DNS only is checked (this alerts the user
  that protocol and port number parameters are
  ignored by ``pyidserver`` in DNS only mode).

- The license for ``plib/test/runtests.py``, the
  generic test-running script, is changed to the
  PSF license so it can be detached from the rest
  of PLIB and used in non-GPL projects.

- Updated to version 0.4 of ``SetupHelper``.

Version 0.2.1
-------------

- Fixed bug in ``PLIB.GUI`` that was appending
  spurious text to ``PMainWindow`` captions.

- Updated to version 0.3.1 of ``SetupHelper``.

Version 0.2
-----------

- Added status bar to ``PMainWindow``, and added demo
  functionality for the status bar to ``pxmlview``.

- Added support for more widget signals (selection
  changed signals for combo box, list view, and tab
  widget), and ensured that all signal-handling
  widgets derive from either ``_PDialogControl`` or
  ``_PNotifyControl``.

- Corrected tab add/delete behavior for tab widget.

- Added private ``_parent`` class field to tab widget,
  for consistency with other non-dialog control
  widgets.

- Added checks to ``PEditor`` to make sure main widget
  supports the editor protocol.

- Improved handling of widget geometry; passing ``None``
  as one of the geometry parameters means that
  parameter doesn't get changed from its previous
  value (which will usually be the default).

- Changed ``PLabel`` to ``PHeaderLabel``, and made
  ``plib.gui.classes`` and ``plib.gui.edit`` into
  private modules; their classes now appear in the
  ``plib.gui.main`` namespace with all the others.

- Added support in ``PIniFile`` for linking options to
  named attributes on the ``PIniFile`` object, instead of
  having get/set functions.

- Added tab widget to ``pxmlview.py`` example program to
  allow viewing multiple files; added support for
  passing multiple file names on the command line.

- Added basic URL parsing to the pyidserver.py example
  program; it now extracts the protocol and port
  number from URLs of the form::

    <protocol>://<url>:<port>

  Protocol and port specifiers in the URL override
  any specifiers in command-line options.

- Added new example program, ``scrips.py``, and its GUI,
  ``scrips-edit.py``; these are programs to keep track
  of prescriptions, demonstrating the table widget
  and INI file functionality in PLIB.

- The ``setup.py`` script now uses a 'generic' helper
  module, ``SetupHelper``; all that is done in setup.py
  itself is to define variables and then call the
  helper module entry point. The SetupHelper module
  is available as its own PyPI project, ``setuphelper``.

- Since SetupHelper handles running post-install
  scripts, the ``install-all`` shell script is no longer
  needed and has been removed.

Version 0.1
-----------

Initial release.
