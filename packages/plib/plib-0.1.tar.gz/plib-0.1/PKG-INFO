Description: The PLIB Package
        ================
        
        The PLIB package provides a top-level namespace for a
        number of useful sub-packages and modules, in order to
        minimize clutter in the top-level namespace of your
        Python installation. Each sub-directory of the plib
        directory contains a sub-package, except for the
        'test' directory, which contains the PLIB test suite.
        The source distribution also contains an examples
        directory, which contains example programs using PLIB,
        and a scripts directory, which contains a few post-install
        scripts.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install PLIB, you can simply run
        
        $ python setup.py install
        
        at a shell prompt from the directory into which you
        unzipped the source tarball (the same directory that this
        README file is in). However, since there are some
        post-install scripts that should be run to fully set up
        PLIB, a shell script is also provided; just run
        
        $ install-all
        
        at a shell prompt in the source directory. After running
        the setup.py installation scripts, this shell script
        runs each of the post-install scripts in the scripts
        directory.
