Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Carousel is a tool for featuring a rotating set of banner images in any section
        of your Plone site.  Features:
        
        * Different sets of banners can be used in different sections of the site.
        
        * Banners can link to another page in the site, or an external URL.
        
        * Banners rotate via a simple fade effect every 8 seconds.  This is
        implemented using the jQuery javascript library which is included with
        Plone, so it's pretty lightweight.
        
        * Clicking on the title of a banner jumps to it immediately.
        
        * Images will not rotate while the mouse cursor is hovering over the Carousel.
        
        
        Compatibility
        =============
        
        Carousel requires Plone 3.0 or greater, mainly because it renders itself in a
        viewlet.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Add Products.Carousel to your buildout's list of eggs, and re-run buildout.
        
        Start up Zope and go to Site Setup, Add-on Products in your Plone site, and
        install the Carousel product.
        
        
        Detailed overview and tests
        ===========================
        
        
        Configuring a Carousel banner folder
        ------------------------------------
        
        The items displayed by Carousel are known as "Carousel Banners" and can exist
        within a "Carousel Folder" in any section of the site.  For purposes of
        demonstration, let's add a Carousel folder to the root of the site.
        
        Carousel folders are a matter of configuration more than content, so they don't
        appear on the Add menu. Instead, there is a 'Configure banners' tab.  Clicking
        it while within a section that doesn't yet have a Carousel folder will result
        in the creation of a new one::
        
        >>> browser.open('http://nohost/plone')
        >>> browser.getLink('Configure banners').click()
        >>> browser.url
        'http://nohost/plone/carousel'
        
        The new folder should now provide the ICarouselFolder interface::
        
        >>> from Products.Carousel.interfaces import ICarouselFolder
        >>> ICarouselFolder.providedBy(self.portal.carousel)
        True
        
        If, on the other hand, we're in a folder that already has a Carousel folder,
        the existing one will be used::
        
        >>> browser.goBack()
        >>> browser.getLink('Configure banners').click()
        >>> browser.url
        'http://nohost/plone/carousel'
        
        And if we try to configure banners while we're already doing so, nothing
        should change::
        
        >>> browser.getLink('Configure banners').click()
        >>> browser.url
        'http://nohost/plone/carousel'
        
        
        Adding a Carousel banner
        ------------------------
        
        Now that we're within the Carousel folder, we can add a Carousel banner using
        the add menu::
        
        >>> browser.getLink('Carousel Banner').click()
        >>> browser.url
        'http://nohost/plone/carousel/portal_factory/Carousel Banner/carousel_banner.../edit'
        
        We can set various things including a title, target URL, and image::
        
        >>> browser.getControl('Title').value = 'Pirates and Cowboys agree: Ninjas suck'
        >>> browser.getControl('URL').value = 'http://www.plone.org'
        >>> browser.getControl(name='image_file')
        <Control name='image_file' type='file'>
        >>> browser.getControl('Save').click()
        >>> 'Changes saved.' in browser.contents
        True
        
        
        Viewing the banners
        -------------------
        
        Now if we return to the home page, where we initially configured the banners,
        the banner we just added should be rendered (*before* the tabs)::
        
        >>> browser.open('http://nohost/plone')
        >>> browser.contents
        <BLANKLINE>
        ...Pirates and Cowboys...
        ...class="contentViews"...

        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.0b2 (2009-02-04)
        ------------------
        
        - Declare dependency of our custom GS import step on the viewlets step.
        [davisagli]
        
        - Separate the (globally-registered) template from the (locally-registered)
        viewlet, so that the former can be customized using
        portal_view_customizations.
        [davisagli]
        
        - Added banner description to the template.  Changed the 'carousel-title'
        class to 'carousel-button' so I could split out 'carousel-title' and
        'carousel-description'.
        [davisagli]
        
        - Fix duplicate entries in quick installer.
        [davisagli]
