Description: repoze.component README
        =======================
        
        ``repoze.component`` is a package that software developers can use to
        provide configurability and pluggability to their applications.
        ``repoze.component`` provides a generalized indirection mechanism
        which can be used to provide plugin points to integrators or other
        developers who may wish to provide alternate implementations of
        application logic or configuration values.
        
        See docs/index.rst or `http://docs.repoze.org/component
        <http://docs.repoze.org/component>`_ for more information.
        
        
        repoze.component Changelog
        ==========================
        
        0.4 (2009-07-25)
        ----------------
        
        - Make compatible with repoze.component 0.4.
        
        - Add ``override`` keys to ``component`` and ``subscriber``
        directives.
        
        0.3 (2009-07-24)
        ----------------
        
        - Update directive implementations to match newer repoze.component
        calling conventions.
        
        - Provide a ``full`` argument to the ``clear`` method of
        ``repoze.component.registry.Registry`` which clears the registry
        entirely instead of just clearing unnamed registrations.  It
        defaults to false.
        
        0.2 (2009-07-11)
        ----------------
        
        - Break apart component type storage into ``__component_types__`` and
        ``__inherited_component_types__`` attributes.
        
        The ``__component_types__`` attribute has become a sequence of
        component types stored directly on an instance as a result of
        ``provides(ob, 'sometype')``.
        
        The ``__inherited_component_types__`` attribute is stored on a class
        as the result of ``provides(cls, 'sometype')`` ( or via a
        class-level call to ``provides('a', 'b')`` ).
        
        We then recompose these two separate attributes into a unified set
        of component types when the ``resolve`` method of the registry is
        called to create an effective list of component types.
        
        - ``repoze.component.directlyprovidedby`` now returns only the types
        directly provided by an instance (its ``__component_types__``);
        previously it would also return the inherited component types
        (because there was no such thing as an inherited component type).
        However, ``repoze.component.providedby`` continues to return all
        component types (both direct and inherited, as well as default
        types).
        
        - Add ``onlyprovides`` API, which overwrites any existing
        ``__component_types__`` (or ``__inherited_component_types__``)
        attribute on the object.  It otherwise acts just like ``provides``.
        
        0.1 (2009-06-22)
        ----------------
        
        - Initial release.
