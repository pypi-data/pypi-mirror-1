*********

0.5 (2009-05-11)
----------------

- add support for opt-in/opt-out functionality
- define new policy: if the form contains a field with id
  'silverpop_opt_in' we use this as control for opt in.
  If the field is True , the user is added to the newsletter.
  If it is False, the user will be opted our from the 
  newsletter (e.g. usage boolean field checkbox checked=1, unchecked=0)

0.4 (2009-05-06)
----------------

- remove workflow for FormSilverpopAdapter [hplocher]

- add functionality to define a custom 'field_id' ->
  'silverpop_column_name' mapping [hplocher]

- add a Mapping grid to the FormSilverPopAdapter:
    (id(readonly), title(readonly), silverpop api key)
    for configuring the mapping [hplocher]

- requires DataGridField [hplocher]

0.3 (2009-04-08)
----------------

- New policy: filter data fields by prefix.  We're only using field names which
  start with COLUMN_NAME_PREFIX ("silverpop_"). This saves us from having field
  names which clash with plone IDs.  Additionally, we've defined a mapping
  table for column names which are required verbatim as of the SilverPop API --
  COLUMN_MAPPING.
