0.3 (2009-04-08)
----------------

- New policy: filter data fields by prefix.  We're only using field names which
  start with COLUMN_NAME_PREFIX ("silverpop_"). This saves us from having field
  names which clash with plone IDs.  Additionally, we've defined a mapping
  table for column names which are required verbatim as of the SilverPop API --
  COLUMN_MAPPING.

- Removed CONFIRMATION logic -- this can be handled better in PFG.
