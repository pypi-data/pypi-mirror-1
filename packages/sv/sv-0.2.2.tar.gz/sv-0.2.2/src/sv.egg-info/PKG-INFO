Description: sv is a wrapper around subversion_ to simplify the task of `branching and merging`_
        
        Specifically, it is a command line tool written in Python that treats branches and tags as first-class names/identifiers so you can operate on them directly without worrying about starting revisions, URLs, and project paths.  Here are some reasons why sv might help you work with subversion:
        
        - sv is optimized for many developers all working on the same project in isolated work branches.
        - Since sv does not rely on properties, you can start using it on an existing repository today.
        - If you are familiar with `git`_'s command line interface, sv is similar

        Install Requirements
        ====================
        
        - `svn client`_
        - `Python 2.4 or greater`_
        - lxml_

        .. _Python 2.4 or greater: http://www.python.org/download/
        .. _lxml: http://codespeak.net/lxml/
        
        However, the easiest way to install sv is, by no coincidence, the following command::
        
        easy_install sv
        
        You will need setuptools_ installed for this to work (and you might need root access on your machine).
