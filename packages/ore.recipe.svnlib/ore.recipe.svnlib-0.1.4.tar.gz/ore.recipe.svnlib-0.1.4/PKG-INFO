Description: ore.recipe.svnlib
        -----------------
        
        A Recipe for downloading and compiling the python subversion
        libraries, this is recipe is based on the zc.recipe.cmmi, and accepts
        all the same recipe options. it downloads and compiles a subversion
        release, additionally it executes the commands to compile and install
        the python subversion bindings. This recipe assumes the usage of a
        python with developer headers, and a swig installation, both can be
        passed in via the extra_options section, if you have installed them in
        custom locations or via buildout.
        
        a note of caution regarding python subversion bindings, releases prior
        to 1.5.0 have memory leaks in the bindings api.
        
        
        an example buildout part, and another part which uses it to construct
        a python interpreter with the svn python bindings::
        
        [subversion]
        recipe=ore.recipe.svnlib
        url=http://subversion.tigris.org/downloads/subversion-1.5.2.tar.bz2
        extra_options=--without-apxs
        
        [python]
        recipe=zc.recipe.egg
        eggs =
        interpreter = python
        extra-paths =
        $[subversion:location}/lib/svn-python
