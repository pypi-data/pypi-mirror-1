<h2 id="why">History and Philosophy</h2>
<p>
PlugBoard is born because of the need to create several plugin-based
projects. These projects, currenly got a plugin management system many
times different between each other and not much organized. So, we
decided to create a shared plugin system to use <strong>in all kinds
of environments</strong> (<em>daemons, GTK, Wx, Twisted an so on</em>).
</p>
<p>
Actually, we chose <a
 href="http://www.zope.org/Products/ZopeInterface/">zope interfaces</a>
to gain a good abstraction level for both framework components and its
based applications.
</p>
<p>
<i>The framework tries to offer as much utilities as possible to create
a plugin-based application and at the same time to be as much flexible
as possible, so that the framework could be applied to all kinds of
projects, as described before.</i>
</p>
<p>
The framework phylosophy let the application base everything on
plugins, then plugins will be the core of the application as well, even
the programmer decide to let the core be pluggable.
</p>
<h2 id="why">Why PlugBoard?</h2>
<p>
PlugBoard is mostly be used for applications which need to be
extensible trough a really flexible way. Eventough PlugBoard got
several components for this purpose, you may not use them all or&nbsp; <strong>use
them by creating your own implementation</strong>.
</p>
<p>
PlugBoard could be apparently hard to understand and use, and it could
appear too "<b>big</b>" for small projects, but making an
appropriate implementation, it could be used as well <em>everywhere</em>.
