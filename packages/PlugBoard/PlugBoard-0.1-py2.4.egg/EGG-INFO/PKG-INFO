Description: PlugBoard is an Application Framework made in Python built on top of setuptools and zope interfaces which help the developer to create a plugin-based application. The framework itself is very extensible trough plugins and let the application be extensible too as well. An applicatio is made up of a plugin resource (get all available plugins in the application), a context resource (organize plugins into different contexts) and an engine to let plugins communicate each other into different environments (such as PlugBoard, Gtk, Wx, Qt, Twisted, and so on).
