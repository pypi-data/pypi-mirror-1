Changes since 0.5.1
-------------------
Updated to work with latest 4Suite

Changes since 0.5
-----------------

- added constants.py 
- data.py must now return COLLECTION or OBJECT when getting asked for
  resourcetype. propfind.py will automatically generate the right xml 
  element.
- <href> now only contains the path
- changed HTTP/1.0 header to HTTP/1.1 which makes it work with WebFolders
- added DO_AUTH constant to AuthServer.py to control whether authentication
  should be done or not.
- added chunked responses in davserver.py
  One step in order to get a server with keep-alive one day.
- we now use 4DOM instead if PyDOM
- the URI in a href is quoted
- complete rewrite of the PROPFIND stuff:
    - error responses are now generated when a property if not found
      or not accessible
    - namespace handling is now better. We forget any prefix and
      create them ourselves later in the response.
- added superclass iface.py in DAV/ in order to make implementing
  interface classes easier. See data.py for how to use it.
  Also note that the way data.py handles things might have changed from
  the previous release (if you don't like it wait for 1.0!)
- added functions to iface.py which format creationdate and lastmodified
- implemented HEAD

- lots of bugfixes


Changes since 0.3
-----------------

- removed hard coded base uri from davserver.py and replaced by
  a reference to the dataclass. Added this to iface.py where you
  have to define it in your subclass.
- added davcmd.py which contains utility functions for copy and move
- reimplemented DELETE and removed dependencies to pydom. move actual
  delete method to davcmd.
- implemented COPY
- implemented MOVE
- fixed bugs in errors.py, needs revisiting anyway..
- URIs are now unquoted in davserver.py before being used
- paths in data.py are quoted in system calls in order to support
  blanks in pathnames (e.g. mkdir '%s' )
- switched to exceptions when catching errors from the interface class
- added exists() method to data.py
- added more uri utility functions to utils.py
- millenium bugfixes ;-)
