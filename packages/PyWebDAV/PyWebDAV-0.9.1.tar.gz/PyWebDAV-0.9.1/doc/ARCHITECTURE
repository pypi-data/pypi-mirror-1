Information
----------

This document describes the architecture of the python davserver.

The main programm is stored in DAV/WebDAVServer.py. It exports a class WebDAVServer
which is subclassed from AuthServer which again is subclassed from 
BufferingHTTPServer.

The BufferingHTTPServer class extends the BaseHTTPServer class by
storing all output in a buffer and sending it at once when the request
is finished. Otherwise clients like cadaver might break.

The AuthServer class implements Basic Authentication in order to make
connections somewhat more secure.

For processing requests the WebDAVServer class needs some connection to
the actual data on server. In contrast to a normal web server this
data must not simply be stored on a filesystem but can also live in
databases and the like.  

Thus the WebDAVServer class needs an interface
to this data which is implemented via an interface class (in our
example stored in fshandler.py). This class will be instantiated by the
WebDAVServer class and be used when needed (e.g. retrieving properties,
creating new resources, obtaining existing resources etc.).

When it comes to parsing XML (like in the PROPFIND and PROPPATCH
methods) the WebDAVServer class uses for each method another extra class
stored e.g. in propfind.py.  This class parses the XML body and
createsan XML response while obtaining data from the interface
class. Thus all the XML parsing is factored out into the specific
method classes.

In order to create your own davserver for your own purposes you have to do the
following:

- subclass the WebDAVServer class and write your own get_userinfo() method for 
  identifying users.

- create your own interface class for interfacing with your actual data. 
  You might use the existing class as skeleton and explanation of which 
  methods are needed.

That should be basically all you need to do. Have a look at PyDAVServer/fileauth.py in order
to get an example how to subclass WebDAVServer.
