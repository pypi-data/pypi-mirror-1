Description: repoze.zcml README
        ==================
        
        ``repoze.zcml`` is a package which provides basic ZCML directives for
        the Zope Component Architecture (such as ``utility``, ``subscriber``,
        and ``adapter``).  You should use ``repoze.zcml`` if your application
        doesn't need the more advanced features of the "stock" directive types
        of the same names present in ``zope.configuration`` (e.g. permissions,
        and trusted adapters/utilities).
        
        Please see docs/index.rst for the documentation.
