THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DOCUMENTED
=================================

- Discussion Control Panel: Some discussion related settings are not located
  in the discussion control panel.

- Monkey Patch: BAD_TYPES list is monkey patched to remove the 
  "Discussion Item" content type. This is needed to show comments in search
  results.

- "As an administrator, I can configure commenting workflow": Controls are
  located in the Types Control Panel.
