Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Formerly Products.project, this package aims for "simple" project management
        with the addition of 4 new content types: client, project, iteration, and task
        (requires Dexterity). It also includes a tool to automate creation of iterations.
        Finally, there is a project workflow for client, project, and iteration that contains
        active/inactive state(s).

        Installation
        ============
        
        To install collective.project using zc.buildout, you can do this:
        
        * Add ``collective.dexterity`` to the list of instance eggs, e.g.::
        
        [instance]
        ...
        eggs =
        ...
        collective.project
        
        * Add ``http://good-py.appspot.com/release/dexterity/1.0a2`` to the list of
        buildout extends, e.g.::
        
        [buildout]
        ...
        extends =
        ...
        http://good-py.appspot.com/release/dexterity/1.0a2
        
        For more information about how to install Dexterity, please see:
        http://plone.org/products/dexterity/documentation/how-to/install.
        
        * Add ``collective.project`` to the list of instance eggs, e.g.::
        
        [instance]
        ...
        eggs =
        ...
        collective.project
        
        * For Plone 3.2.x and under, tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a
        ZCML slug::
        
        [instance]
        recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
        ...
        zcml =
        collective.project
        
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
        
        $ ./bin/buildout
        
        You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
        from another package's configure.zcml file, or if you are using Plone 3.3.x or
        higher.
