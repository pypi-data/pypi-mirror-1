Description: plone.recipe.alltests
        =====================
        
        This recipe creates a testrunner script which is suitable for running all
        tests in a buildout environment at once.
        
        At least in Zope2 there are frequently test isolation problems caused by too
        much global state being used. Instead of fighting against these test isolation
        problems, this recipe provides a convenient way to run all tests on a package
        by package basis, provides an overall summary and exits with a combined status
        code for all tests runs. The latter makes it possible to use this in a
        buildbot environment.
        
        
        Options
        -------
        
        The options you can set in the recipes section in your `buildout.cfg`.
        
        eggs
        A list of packages that should be tested.
        
        test-script
        The file system location of a `zc.recipe.testrunner` test runner, which
        needs to be configured correctly to run all tests for all specified eggs.
        
        exclude
        A list of eggs which should be excluded from the test runs. The values are
        interpreted as Python regular expressions.
        
        groups
        A buildout section containing a mapping of group names to package names.
        
        package-map
        An buildout section containing a mapping of distribution names to package
        names.
        
        Scripts
        -------
        
        This recipe create one script named after the recipe section.
