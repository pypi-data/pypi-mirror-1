        osha.policy Changelog
        =====================
        
        slc.publications 1.1 (2009-06-04)
        ---------------------------------
        
        * added a download time estimation control [pilz]
        * removed the hardcoded author from the config file and the schema [pilz]
        * Trying to make it work without Linguaplone as well [pilz]
        * added link to title and image [pilz]
        * Added possibility to add manual relations to other content types. This
        includes a language fallback [brand]
        
        
        slc.publications 1.0 final
        --------------------------
        
        * no changes
        
        slc.publications 1.0 beta3
        --------------------------
        
        * Added support for slc.xliff
        * refactored the adapter.py into adapter/ subdir
        * Added an eventhandler to automatically set the suptype on files added to a publication folder
        * Added an eventhandler to detect the uploaded language if the filename starts or
        ends with a lang abbrev
        E.g. XX_filename.pdf or filename_XX.pdf or XX-filename.pdf or filename-XX.pdf.
        * Added a patch for linguaplone inserting a new event to allow translating
        subtyped objects. Translations need to be subtyped just after the object has
        been created and before attributes are edited.

        --------------------------

        Publication Product
        ===================
        
        The Publication Product can be used to organise printed publications that are available online for download. Such Publications usually have a publication date, order and ISBN numbers, an author and exist in several language versions. Once stored in the Publication Product, they can be displayed using autogenerated overviews.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        * Requires
        
        - On Plone2.5: AdvancedQuery (http://www.dieter.handshake.de/pyprojects/zope/#AdvancedQuery)
        (thanks to Alin Voinea for pointing that out)
        
        - xpath that comes with pyxml
        (http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=6473&package_id=6541&release_id=286213)
        (thanks to Alin Voinea for pointing that out)
        
        - p4a.subtyper, p4a.common, p4a.z2utils
        
        - archetypes.schemaextender
        
        - LinguaPlone (the product might run without but I have not bothered to make the calls to LP conditional yet...)
        
        
        * Put this package in your Zope's Products directory and restart Zope
        
        * use the QuickInstaller to add this product to your Plone site
        
        * Optional: pdfinfo to parse pdf metadata (part of the xpdf package)
        
        * Optional: pdftk and imagemagicks convert to generate a
        cover image from a pdf file
        
        Translations
        ------------
        Note that the ATCT file object by default has a languageIndependent file attribute. That means that you can translate the Title and Description of a file object but not change the real file. Publications changes this behaviour for ATCT and Blob files.
        
        LinguaPlone is patched
        ----------------------
        
        the file linguaplone_addTranslation_patch patches linguaplones addTranslation method.
        It simply adds a new event that is thrown after a translation is created but before
        its data is set. This is necessary because on translation we need to subtype before we
        can set any data, otherwise the schema will not be extended.
