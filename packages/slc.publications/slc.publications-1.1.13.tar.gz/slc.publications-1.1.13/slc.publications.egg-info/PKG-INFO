        Publication Product
        ===================
        
        The Publication Product can be used to organise printed publications that are available online for download. Such Publications usually have a publication date, order and ISBN numbers, an author and exist in several language versions. Once stored in the Publication Product, they can be displayed using autogenerated overviews.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        * Requires
        
        - On Plone2.5: AdvancedQuery (http://www.dieter.handshake.de/pyprojects/zope/#AdvancedQuery)
        (thanks to Alin Voinea for pointing that out)
        
        - xpath that comes with pyxml
        (http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=6473&package_id=6541&release_id=286213)
        (thanks to Alin Voinea for pointing that out)
        
        - p4a.subtyper, p4a.common, p4a.z2utils
        
        - archetypes.schemaextender
        
        - LinguaPlone (the product might run without but I have not bothered to make the calls to LP conditional yet...)
        
        
        * Put this package in your Zope's Products directory and restart Zope
        
        * use the QuickInstaller to add this product to your Plone site
        
        * Optional: pdfinfo to parse pdf metadata (part of the xpdf package)
        
        * Optional: pdftk and imagemagicks convert to generate a
        cover image from a pdf file
        
        Translations
        ------------
        Note that the ATCT file object by default has a languageIndependent file attribute. That means that you can translate the Title and Description of a file object but not change the real file. Publications changes this behaviour for ATCT and Blob files.
        
        LinguaPlone is patched
        ----------------------
        
        the file linguaplone_addTranslation_patch patches linguaplones addTranslation method.
        It simply adds a new event that is thrown after a translation is created but before
        its data is set. This is necessary because on translation we need to subtype before we
        can set any data, otherwise the schema will not be extended.
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        See the *doc* directory in this package.

        Changelog
        ==========================
        
        1.1.13 (2009-11-09)
        -------------------
        
        - removed unnecessary reference to OSHA in subtyper/publication.py (thomasw)
        - typo in FR translation (thomasw)
        - added possibility to display additional info on the view of a publication via an adapter (thomasw)
        
        1.1.12 (2009-10-18)
        -------------------
        
        -translate the contents of the author field - workaround since the field is language-independent (thomasw)
        
        1.1.11 (2009-10-14)
        -------------------
        
        - rerelease. There was a mistake where parts of the package did not get into the egg
        
        1.1.10 (2009-10-13)
        -------------------
        
        - fixed an inconsistency in the related publications where language indepentent was not used (pilz)
        - replaced all occurences of i18n:translate in the publication_view template
        with a call to a method on the view that uses MessageFactory. I couldn't figure
        out why i18n:translate worked for some langs, and not for others such as NL (thomasw)
        
        
        
        1.1.9 (2009-10-06)
        ------------------
        - Chapter links now always point to the url. Normally, if you click on a link
        and you have edit rights, you would go to the link view and not to the link
        target. Since we already offer a second edit link, when somebody has edit
        rights, the regular link can point directly to the place the link points to.
        (gerken)
        
        - Refactored the Chapter Update functionality. It is not a method any longer
        but a class. That way one can modify the behaviour without the need to
        copy the complete functionality (gerken)
        
        1.1.8 (2009-09-30)
        ------------------
        - Hide the JS-scanner induced PDF icon from the Related publications list on the publication's view (jcbrand)
        
        1.1.7 (2009-09-15)
        ------------------
        - Add try,except to decouple from Products.LinguaPlone (jcbrand)
        - don't display a JS-scanner--induced PDF-icon in front of the publication's title (thomasw)
        
        1.1.6 (2009-08-26)
        ------------------
        
        - Add remove_additionals event handler in adapter/events.py and register it via zcml for IObjectRemovedEvent (jcbrand)
        - Edited the object_added event: removed the code that sets translation
        references, it has been superseded by slc.autotranslate. (jcbrand)
        - Removed _findAbbrev in adapter/events.py, it's no longer being called (jcbrand)
        - Added a new doctest file events.txt to test for the above actions. (jcbrand)
        
        1.1.5 (2009-08-13)
        ------------------
        
        - enhanced setuphandlers.py (together with import_steps.xml and config.py) to automatically install dependencies. (jcbrand)
        - remove explicit blob checking in adapter/publication.py and instead do it via zcml, i.e zcml:condition="installed plone.app.blob" (jcbrand)
        - modified addTranslation patch to return the translated item as is done in of LinguaPlone >= 2.3 (jcbrand)
        - various new translations have been added (thomasw)
        
        1.1.4 (2009-07-26)
        ------------------
        
        - have links to publication language versions open in a new window (pilz)
        
        1.1.3 (2009-07-03)
        ------------------
        
        - changed the link format for the EU Bookshop to fit the new guideline (thomasw)
        - Make 'related content' box look like the 'related publications' box (jcbrand)
        
        1.1.2 (2009-06-19)
        ------------------
        
        - svn:ignore cleanup, removed prints
        
        - test fixes (gerken)
        
        1.1.1 (2009-06-04)
        ------------------
        
        - made a release without the svn revision in the tag
        
        1.1 (2009-06-04)
        ----------------
        
        * added a download time estimation control [pilz]
        * removed the hardcoded author from the config file and the schema [pilz]
        * Trying to make it work without Linguaplone as well [pilz]
        * added link to title and image [pilz]
        * Added possibility to add manual relations to other content types. This
        includes a language fallback [brand]
        
        
        1.0 final
        ---------
        
        * no changes
        
        1.0 beta3
        ---------
        
        * Added support for slc.xliff
        * refactored the adapter.py into adapter/ subdir
        * Added an eventhandler to automatically set the suptype on files added to a publication folder
        * Added an eventhandler to detect the uploaded language if the filename starts or
        ends with a lang abbrev
        E.g. XX_filename.pdf or filename_XX.pdf or XX-filename.pdf or filename-XX.pdf.
        * Added a patch for linguaplone inserting a new event to allow translating
        subtyped objects. Translations need to be subtyped just after the object has
        been created and before attributes are edited.
        
        1.0 beta2
        ---------
        
        * Switch to p4a.subtyper to make publications out of files
