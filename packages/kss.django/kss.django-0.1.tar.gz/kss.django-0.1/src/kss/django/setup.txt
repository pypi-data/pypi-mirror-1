Setup
=====

Before you can use KSS with Django it needs to be setup.


Loading plugins
===============

The `kss.base` system has a `load_plugins` function to make a plugin
available. This function checks that each plugin is registered only
once. It will fail if you try to register a plugin again.

To avoid problems with the reloading of the settings file `kss.django`
has a wrapper which makes sure it is only executed once.

  >>> from kss.django import load_plugins
  >>> load_plugins('core')

If we load the plugin again it will just silenty ignore our request.

  >>> load_plugins('core')
