Description: Poly provides a framework for rapidly developing distributed
        applications where the number of work units to be performed is known
        in advance. It automatically handles many of the hassles of
        distributed computing, such as:
        
        * assigning work units to jobs
        * reassembling one output file from the standard outputs of many jobs
        * copying files between servers and execution hosts
        * cleaning up temporary files on execution hosts
        * job and I/O throttling to reduce load on servers
        
        Poly currently includes drivers for running under Platform LSF and
        in standalone mode, but drivers for other distributed computing
        environments can be added easily.
        
        Poly also includes applications to distribute processing directly from
        the shell, with no additional programming needed.
