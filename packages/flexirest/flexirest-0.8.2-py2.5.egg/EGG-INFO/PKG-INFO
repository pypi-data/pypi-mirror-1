        `Flexirest` is a project that was born out of the authors long-running
        interest for reStructuredText_, and the idea of writing everyday
        documents like letters, invoices and other simple documents in this
        way.
        
        .. _reStructuredText: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html
        
        `Flexirest` tries to strike a middle ground between docutils_ own
        command line tool chain (`rst2html` et al), that I find a little to
        minimalistic and Sphinx_, that I find very nice but a little heavy to
        use for a quickie document like a random letter or some such.

        .. _Sphinx: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/
        
        In short, the goal of `flexirest` is to enable you to use the `reST`
        format for everyday documents instead of a word processor or similar
        with minimal fuzz. Hence you get to stay in the comfy environment of
        your text editor and tool chain. And you can check in your docs *in text
        format* into your version control system of choice. And, if used
        correctly, you get to reuse a couple of stylings that you only need to
        create once.
        
        There are some modestly advanced tricks you can do too, primarily
        writing your own `docutils` roles_, but I wouldn't consider those the
        major points of flexirest.

        Changes
        -------
        
        0.8.2
        +++++
        
        * A mechanism of two-stage writing used to support a new writer,
        `latex2pdf` that renders directly to PDF via LaTeX if a suitable
        executable is available on the host system.
        * `--infile` option to specify input from a file
        * `--outfile` option to specify output to a file
        * `--dump-parts` option to inspect output from different `docutils`
        parts.
        * `--list-writer` option to list available writers on the host system.
        * No traceback when specifying a non-existant writer
        * All writers have at least the minimal template (`%(whole)s`)
        * Switch to `Distribute` instead of `setuptools` for development and
        packaging.
        * Many small bugfixes and stability improvements
