Assumptions
===========

In order to make this a successful tool that can be implemented in a decent
amount of time, we need to make some hard assumptions that restrict the scope.

- Do not support any possible configuration.

- Only support WSGI setups.

- Support paster setups only (?)

- only support z3c.form (for now)

- all references should be by string, so that we do nto create insane
  dependency trees.
