Installation
============

You may have setuptools already installed for your system Python. In
that case, you may need to upgrade it first because buildout requires
a very recent version::

    $ sudo easy_install -U setuptools

If this command fails because easy_install is not available, there is
a good chance you do not have setuptools available for your system
Python. If so, there is no problem because setuptools will be
installed locally by buildout.

Bootstrap the buildout environment::

    $ python bootstrap/bootstrap.py

and run the buildout command::

    $ bin/buildout
    [lots of stuff will be downloaded and installed locally here]

Run the tests::

    bin/test
