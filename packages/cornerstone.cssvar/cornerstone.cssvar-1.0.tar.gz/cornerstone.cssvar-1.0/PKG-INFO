Description: This is an implementation of a ``CSS Variables`` extension for Zope Browser
        Resources.
        
        Cascading Stylesheets don't have any built in method to define variables and use
        them within the stylesheet. This feature was discussed at some CSS related
        blogs already and resulted in a `non-official draft specification`_.
        
        .. _`non-official draft specification`: http://disruptive-innovations.com/zoo/cssvariables/
        
        In former Zope versions DTML templating language was used to define variables in
        CSS. This breaks CSS syntax, looks crappy and produces error messages in
        CSS-enabled editors even if the browser gets the correct values.
        
        cornerstone.cssvar uses an almost CSS syntax compatible variant to apply
        variables::
        
        div.foo {
        color: var(myColor);
        }
        
        If we declare such a css resource using zcml it looks this way::
        
        \<browser:cssvarResource
        name="foo"
        file="foo.css"
        />
        
        If we use the common mechanism to declare variables using css like syntax we
        must do this in a separate file, this looks like::
        
        @variables {
        myColor: #123456;
        }
        
        The variable itself need to be defined by a named ``ICSSVariables`` adapter on
        request. We can register it by an own zcml directive::
        
        <browser:cssvarDefinition
        name="foodef"
        file="foodef.css"
        />
        
        Now we just need to tell our first css file which definition to use. Here
        theres no common syntax, so we put it in an comment::
        
        /# vardef(foodef) /#
        div.foo {
        color: var(myColor);
        }
        
        If we now in browser look at ``http://mydomain.tld/++resource++foo`` it results
        in::
        
        /# vardef(foodef) /#
        div.foo {
        color: #123456;
        }
        
        For resource directories as defined by ``zope.app.publisher`` the special CSS
        handling is registered for every CSS file if this module is imported.
        
        This package is tested with Zope 3.5dev KGS (Python 2.6 )and in Zope 2.10.7
        (with Plone 3.3 and Python 2.4).
