        ===============
        
        This document describes the zest.emailhider package.
        
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        This package depends on kss.plugin.cacheability to use GET requests instead of
        POST.
        
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        This package provides a mechanism to hide email addresses with KSS. Objects
        display a placeholder link with a 'hidden-email' class and a 'uid' kss
        attribute set to the UID of a user; a KSS click action is bound to the link
        which replaces it with a 'mailto' link directed at the email address of the
        user. Using this mechanism the email address isn't visible in the initial page
        load, and it requires JavaScript to be seen - so it's much harder for spammers
        to harvest.
        
        Object are marked with the IMailable interface - this states that they can
        provide uid and email attributes. The 'emailhider' view is provided to
        generate the placeholder link.
        
        Note: For publicly viewable email address, KSS must be made publicly
        accessible.
        
        History of zest.emailhider package
        ==================================
        
        
        1.3 (2009-12-28)
        ----------------
        
        - Made reveal_email available always, as it should just work whenever
        we want to hide the glocal 'email_from_address'.  If we have a real
        uid target, then try to adapt that target to the IMailable interface
        and if that fails we just silently do nothing.

        1.2 (2008-11-19)
        ----------------
        
        - Using kss.plugin.cacheability and added it as a dependency.  [jladage]
        
        - Allow to set the uid to email_from_address.  [jladage]
        
        - Changed the KSS to use the load event instead of the click event - it
        now either works transparently, or asks the user to activate JS. [simon]
