        Now only ebuild for gentoo is generated. spec for rpm-base distribution,
        dpkg for dpkg-base distribution will be added in future.

        * Pre-defined, user-defined schemes for different usage.
        * Update from PyPI and cached into localhost scheme is provided.
        * Update from localhost scheme is provided, so the package file will not have to be downloaded again and again.
        * Wildcard is permitted in package names. For example: [Aa]*.
        * Full automatically log, all passed or failed packages(with reason) are recorded in log.
        * Some packages can be masked for manually written ebuild.
        * Multiple template support, to support different packages types. Now only standard distutils/setuptools template and single python template are provided. More template, such as webapp, will be added in future.
        * Package specific config, patches supported. User can manage their private config, patches in /etc/pypi2pkgsys too.
        * pypi-logstats.py is provided to show the statistics from log files.
        * pypi-manualcache.py is provided to generate localhost cache entries from self-downloaded package files. This reserve a great deal of time to download big files from pypi.python.org.
