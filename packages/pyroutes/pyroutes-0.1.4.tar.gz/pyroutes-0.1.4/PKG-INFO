        =========
        A really small wrapper for rapid development of small python
        web applications
        
        Why?
        -----
        I got tired of dealing with the same boring WSGI-stuff everytime
        I wanted to make a small web-utility in django, but I didn't want
        to go to far away from it, so I made this little thing to ease the
        work a bit.
        
        How it works
        -------------
        The core of the system is WSGI, and a decorator called @route.
        You simple create add a route decorator in front of the function
        you want to handle requests to a certain path. pyroutes always
        tries to use the most specified path-handler available for the request.
        That means `@route('/foo/bar')` will always be used over `@route('/foo')`
        given that request path is `/foo/bar` or longer that is :-)
        Notice that paths have to be given without a trailing slash.
        
        The decorated function should return the helper `Response` class.
        The `Response` class takes three arguments: `content`, `headers` and `status_code`.
        `content` is the data that should be returned, `headers` a list of tuples representing
        the http-headers returned and `status_code` a valid HTTP status code. If `headers` and `status_code`
        is omitted it defaults to `text/html` as content type and `200 OK` as status code.
        
        Example:
        
        @route('/')
        def index(environ, data):
        return Response('Hello world!')
        
        
        Noticed the parameters to the index function? Those are mandatory.
        The `environ`-parameter is the unmodified environment from WSGI and
        `data` is a dictionary with the GET and POST parameters.
        
        Templating
        ----------
        
        pyroutes includes a small xml-based templating system called xml-template.
        For more information about xml-template, check out its bzr-repo from
        http://bzr.sesse.net/xml-template
        XML-Template is released under the GPLv2 license.
