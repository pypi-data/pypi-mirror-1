	* MuleHashDB:

	Instead of raising Exceptions, not that meaningfull for end users, we now
	just print an error message and exit.
	ChangeLog is now included in MANIFEST.in, it was missing.
	Introduced a new command line option that allows to pass an alternate
	configuration file.
	Released version 0.1.1, and on the forge for version 0.2.0 are some
	database layout changes, we'll seize the moment and do it now, to prevent
	future problems with database upgrades.
