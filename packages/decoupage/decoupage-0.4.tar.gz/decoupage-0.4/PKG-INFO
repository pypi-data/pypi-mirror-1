Description: decoupage
        =========
        
        what is it?
        -----------
        
        decoupage is a static file server that allows for index pages
        configurable with genshi templates and .ini files.  I mainly wrote it
        because i was tired of using apache for serving my website and
        generating index.html files by hand.
        
        
        how do i use it?
        ----------------
        
        Set up a `paste <http://pythonpaste.org>`_ .ini file that specifies the
        directory to serve (``decoupage.directory``) and, optionally, a
        configuration file .ini file (``decoupage.configuraton``) which
        specifies the labels for the files based on directory. An example of a
        `paste <http://pythonpaste.org>`_ .ini file is in
        ``decoupage.ini``. Note the ``[app:decoupage]`` section::
        
        [app:decoupage]
        paste.app_factory = decoupage.factory:factory
        decoupage.directory = %(here)s/example
        decoupage.configuration = %(here)s/example.ini
        
        The labels for files are in ``example.ini``, specified by sections as
        directories::
        
        [/]
        foo.txt = a file about cats
        
        [/cats]
        lilly.txt = lilly
        hobbes.txt = a file about Hobbes
        
        You can specify the entire layout from here.  Alternately, you can
        have an ``index.ini`` in a directory which, if present, overrides the
        default configuration.  Such a file is in the ``fleem`` subdirectory
        of ``example``::
        
        /template = index.html
        fleem.txt = some fleem for ya
        
        Try it out!  Install decoupage and run ``paster serve decoupage.ini``
        and point your browser to the URL it gives you.
        
        
        how do i do more with decoupage?
        --------------------------------
        
        Since filenames can't start with a ``/`` (just try it!), the
        functionality of decoupage may be extended with ``/`` commands in a
        section.  This is done by adding a setuptools ``entry_point`` to
        ``[decoupage.formatters]``.  See the decoupage ``setup.py`` and
        ``decoupage.formatters`` for examples.
