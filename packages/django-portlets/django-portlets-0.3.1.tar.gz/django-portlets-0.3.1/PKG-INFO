Description: What is it?
        ===========
        
        Portlets are pieces of content which are managed in Slots. Slots can be freely defined and placed
        anywhere within a HTML page. There are also some more advanced features like inheriting and blocking
        of portlets.
        
        django-portlets provides just a generic engine to manage portlets. You can find a comprehensive
        implementation within `LFS`_.
        
        Example
        ===========
        django-portlets comes with a simple example application which shows how to use it.
