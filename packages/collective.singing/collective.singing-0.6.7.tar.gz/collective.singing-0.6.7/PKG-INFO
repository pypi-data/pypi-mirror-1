        Singing is a Zope 3 library for sending notifications and newsletters.
        
        You can find the development version of collective.singing in the
        `Subversion repository
        <http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/collective.singing/trunk#egg=collective.singing-dev>`_.
        
        History
        =======
        
        Version 0.6.7 - 2008-12-03
        --------------------------
        
        - Part of Czech translation.
        [naro]
        
        - Some refactoring in order to allow for more customized subscription forms.
        [nouri]
        
        - Added french translation.
        
        Version 0.6.6 - 2008-11-13
        --------------------------
        
        - Add the subscriber languages to subscription metadata at
        subscription time.  [nouri]
        
        Version 0.6.5 - 2008-11-05
        --------------------------
        
        - Used ``i18ndude`` to find all untranslated msgid's. Some line-numbers were
        corrected, but nothing changed in ``collective.singing``.  There were some
        updates in collective.dancing, so all guy's please help updating
        collective.dancing's po files.  [saily]
        
        - Add ``async`` module that allows to queue jobs for asynchronous
        execution.  Creating this was necessary because ``zc.async`` is not
        available for all Zope versions that ``collective.dancing`` aims to
        work with.  :-( [nouri]
        
        - Allow for more finer grained control of cue in
        ``IMessageAssemble.render_message``.  This allows a preview function
        to request the cue to be used but not to be set when rendering a
        preview. [nouri]
        
        Version 0.6.4 - 2008-10-29
        --------------------------
        
        - Added optional checking for channel attr 'sendable' to
        channel_lookup. Sending of a content item from the
        sendnewsletter view in dancing uses this feature, to be able
        to supress some channels. Also added vocabularies that contain
        only sendable or only subscribeable channels.
        [tmog]
        
        - Relabelled buttons on the stats page to use the term 'clear' rather
        than 'flush'. Also renamed related handlers and method. [russf]
        
        
        Version 0.6.3 - 2008-09-11
        --------------------------
        
        - Register the SubscriptionSearchableText adapter so that the fulltext
        index is actually populated. [nouri]
        
        Version 0.6.2 - 2008-09-03
        --------------------------
        
        - Add 'headers' argument to ``mail.create_html_mail`` to allow the
        injection of more e-mail headers. [nouri]
        
        Version 0.6.1 - 2008-08-28
        --------------------------
        
        - Add zope.sendmail as a dependency so that we get the latest and
        greates release. [nouri]
        
        - IMailDelivery expects ``toaddrs`` to be a list of addresses. [nouri]
        
        - Use DumbWriters word wrapping to ensure that no text line
        is longer than plain_text_maxcols characters. [saily]
        
        - Using HTMLParser.anchorlist to append all links found in
        a message at the bottom of the text/plain message. [saily]
        
        Version 0.6.0 - 2008-08-21
        --------------------------
        
        - Moved 'singing.scheduler.assemble_messages' and 'render_message'
        into their own IMessageAssemble adapter (on channel).  This allows
        for easier hooking into these policy-riddled functions to make them
        work differently for different types of channels.  Also, added a
        small flag that allows to ignore the subscriber's 'cue' completely.
        [nouri]
        
        Version 0.5.0 - 2008-07-29
        --------------------------
        
        - Start depending on plone.z3cform>=0.3dev
        [nouri]
        
        Version 0.4 - 2008-07-23
        ------------------------
        
        - Added optional checking for channel attr 'subscribeable' to
        channel_lookup. Subscription validaton and the subscribe portlet use
        this feature.
        [tmog]
        
        - Bringing versioning in line with
        http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools
        [stonor]
        
        - Added full_schema used on the edit page for Filtered Collectors. Now
        we can re-edit these ;-)
        [tmog]
        
        - Make call of MessageQueues.flush() more flexible to get a handy
        method to flush also new messages. this doesnt change any current
        behaviour.
        [jensens]
        
        - Added Polish translation by Barbara Struk
        [naro]
        
        Version 0.3
        -----------
        
        - Use zc.lockfile instead of the excessive use of transaction.commit()
        to lock the queue processing.
        [nouri]
        
        - Use email.Header module for message header formatting
        Refactored mail.py to create messages MIMEMultipart based
        [naro]
        
        - added Czech translation
        [naro]
        
        Version 0.2
        -----------
        
        - Commit after pulling a message from the queue.
        [nouri]
        
        - ITransform is now an adapter on the content being transformed
        instead of a utility.  This allows us to use the content's URL
        when rewriting links.
        [tmog]
        
        - updated pot and danish translation
        [bartholdy]
        
        - Add button to subscribe form to "Send my subscription details",
        for when subscribers forgot their secret.
        [nouri]
        
        - Cleaned up a bit in a few templates. Needed to structure
        view/Desvription in wizard. Got rid of annoying label filters in
        wizard-step.
