Fudge Documentation
===================

Fudge is a Python module for using fake objects (mocks, stubs, etc) to test real ones.

The module is designed for two specific situations:

- Replace an object
  
  - Temporarily return a canned value for a 
    method or allow a method to be called without affect.

- Ensure an object is used correctly

  - Declare expectations about what methods should be 
    called and what arguments should be sent.

Fudge was inspired by `Mocha <http://mocha.rubyforge.org/>`_ (Ruby) which is a simpler version of `jMock <http://www.jmock.org/>`_ (Java).
