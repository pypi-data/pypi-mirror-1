===================
Fudge Documentation
===================

Fudge is a Python module for using fake objects (mocks, stubs, etc) to test real ones.

This module is designed for two specific situations:

- Replace an object
  
  - Temporarily return a canned value for a 
    method or allow a method to be called without affect.

- Ensure an object is used correctly

  - Declare expectations about what methods should be 
    called and what arguments should be sent.

Fudge was inspired by `Mocha <http://mocha.rubyforge.org/>`_ which is a simpler version of `jMock <http://www.jmock.org/>`_.  But unlike Mocha, Fudge does not automatically hijack real objects; you explicitly :ref:`patch them <fudge.patcher>` in your test setup.  And unlike jMock, Fudge is only as strict about expectations as you want it to be.  If you just want to expect a method call without worrying about its arguments or the type of the arguments then you can.

Download / Install
==================

Just type::

    $ sudo easy_install fudge

If you don't have ``easy_install`` for Python you can get it like this::

    $ wget http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py
    $ sudo python ez_setup.py

Fudge requires Python 2.4 or higher and is developed primarily against 2.5 and 2.6.

Changelog
=========

- 0.9.4
  
  - Fixed bug where __init__ would always return the Fake instance of itself.  
    Now you can return a custom object if you want.

- 0.9.3
  
  - Added ``with_args()`` to :ref:`JavaScript Fudge <javascript-fudge>`.
  - Fixed bug where argument values that overloaded __eq__ might cause declared expectations to fail (patch from Michael Williamson, Issue 9)
  - Fixed bug where :func:`fudge.Fake.raises` obscured :func:`fudge.Fake.with_args` (Issue 6)
  - Fixed ``returns_fake()`` in JavaScript Fudge.

- 0.9.2
  
  - **Changed**: values in failed comparisons are no longer shortened when too long.
  - **Changed**: :func:`fudge.Fake.calls` no longer trumps expectations 
    (i.e. :func:`fudge.Fake.with_args`)
  - **Changed**: :func:`fudge.Fake.with_args` is more strict.  You will now see an error 
    when arguments are not expected yet keyword arguments were expected and vice versa.  
    This was technically a bug but is listed under 
    changes in case you need to update your code.  Note that you can work 
    with arguments more expressively using the new :mod:`fudge.inspector` functions.
  - Added :mod:`fudge.inspector` for :ref:`working-with-arguments`.
  - Added :func:`fudge.Fake.remember_order` so that order of expected calls can be verified.
  - Added :func:`fudge.Fake.raises` for simulating exceptions
  - Added keyword :func:`fudge.Fake.next_call(for_method="other_call") <fudge.Fake.next_call>` 
    so that arbitrary methods can be modified (not just the last one).
  - Fixed: error is raised if you declare multiple :func:`fudge.Fake.provides` for the same Fake. 
    This also applies to :func:`fudge.Fake.expects`
  - Fixed bug where :func:`fudge.Fake.returns` did not work if you had replaced a call with :func:`fudge.Fake.calls`
  - Fixed bug in :func:`fudge.Fake.next_call` so that this now works: ``Fake(callable=True).next_call().returns(...)``
  - Fixed: Improved Python 2.4 compatibility.
  - Fixed bug where ``from fudge import *`` did not import proper objects.

- 0.9.1
  
  - **DEPRECATED** fudge.start() in favor of :func:`fudge.clear_calls`
  - **DEPRECATED** fudge.stop() in favor of :func:`fudge.verify`
  - Added context manager :func:`fudge.patcher.patched_context` so the with statement can be used for 
    patching (contributed by Cristian Esquivias)
  - Added :func:`fudge.Fake.times_called` to expect a certain call count (contributed by Cristian Esquivias)
  - Added :class:`Fake(expect_call=True) <fudge.Fake>` to indicate an expected callable.  Unlike 
    :class:`Fake(callable=True) <fudge.Fake>` the former will raise an error if not called.
  
- 0.9.0
  
  - first release
