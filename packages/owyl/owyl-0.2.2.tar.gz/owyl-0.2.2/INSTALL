=================
 Installing Owyl
=================

Install Owyl using the standard distutils method:

  $ python setup.py install

Owyl can also be installed with easy_install:

  $ easy_install owyl


Egenix mxBase
=============

Owyl will use mx.Stack if it is available. Otherwise, it uses a
regular list to emulate a stack. mx.Stack should offer a small
performance boost.

Egenix mxBase can be found and downloaded at
<http://www.egenix.com/products/python/mxBase/>.


Development and Testing
=======================

To develop and test Owyl, use buildout to set up your environment:

  $ python bootstrap.py
  $ ./bin/buildout
  $ ./bin/nosetests -vxd

Everything's a little easier if you use `Vellum
<https://launchpad.net/vellum/>`_.

  $ vellum test

Note: If you want to use vellum, the various 'clean' targets require
remove.py, which you will find in the root distribution folder. Copy
it somewhere on your PYTHON_PATH, and vellum won't complain.


Thanks
======

Thanks for trying out Owyl. Hopefully, you'll find Owyl easy to work
with and adapt. Please visit the discussion board at
<http://groups.google.com/group/owyl-discuss/> if you run into any
trouble.
