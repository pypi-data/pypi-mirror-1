=================
 Welcome to Owyl!
=================

You have Pyglet. You've got Rabbyt. But who do your sprites go to for
advice? Owyl, of course.

The goal of Owyl: provide a fast and flexible Behavior Tree library
implemented in python. For more information on Behavior Trees, see
the articles at <http://aigamedev.com/hierarchical-logic>.

Owyl has been tested on python 2.5. It will probably work on 2.4 and
2.6. Please let me know if you have any trouble with it.

Installation
============

Install Owyl using the standard distutils method:

  $ python setup.py install

Owyl can also be installed with easy_install:

 $ easy_install owyl


Documentation
=============

API documentation can be found at <http://worlds.eykd.net/owyl/api/>.

For more information about Owyl, please visit the project site at
<http://code.google.com/p/owyl/>.


Development and Testing
=======================

To develop and test Owyl, use buildout to set up your environment:

  $ python bootstrap.py
  $ ./bin/buildout
  $ ./bin/nosetests -vxd

Everything's a little easier if you use `Vellum
<https://launchpad.net/vellum/>`_.

  $ vellum test

Hopefully, you'll find Owyl easy to work with and adapt.
