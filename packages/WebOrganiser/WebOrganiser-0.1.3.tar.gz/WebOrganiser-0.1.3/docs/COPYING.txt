Notes on Icons and Images
-------------------------

The inclusion of icons can be configured by the packager, but where such icons
have been included there are from the following sources:

Everaldo's "Crystal SVG" icon theme for KDE
  - see COPYING-CrystalSVG.txt for copyright and licensing information

Everaldo's "Crystal Clear" icon theme for KDE
  - see COPYING-CrystalClear.txt for copyright and licensing information from
    the Debian repackaging of that work

Tango Icon Theme
  - see COPYING-Tango.txt and AUTHORS-Tango.txt for copyright and licensing
    information from the original source package

In the tools/patches directory, a patch against one of the Tango icons has
been included. Whilst this only removes text from the original icon, it is
hereby acknowledged that the included text originates from the Tango icon
named in the patch.

The presence of ICONS.txt files indicates supplied icons in those locations
where such icons reside.
