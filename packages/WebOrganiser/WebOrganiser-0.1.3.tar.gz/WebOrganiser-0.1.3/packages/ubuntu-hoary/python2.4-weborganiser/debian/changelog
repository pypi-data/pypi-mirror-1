weborganiser (0.1.2-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Improved handling of imported resources, returning more
    accurate (or more conformant) status codes.
  * Simplified person searching in event and to-do item
    editing; added person details to the retrieved person
    items by merging in their contact details.
  * Added event, to-do item and card creation in the
    calendar view (fixing redirects in the item list view).
  * Added a check to prevent cards being created without
    some kind of URIRef being defined. Other item types are
    also likely to have similar restrictions applied.
  * Changed the identifier scheme so that URI references for
    items belonging to a store have unprefixed identifiers,
    and all other items have prefixed identifiers of some
    kind.
  * Introduced URIRef-based property values, requiring
    various changes in the filtering mechanisms (such as
    "related-to" and "person").
  * Provided translations for various screens.
  * Added images to the various summary screens, adjusting
    the layout and moving table headers to the "controls"
    section where possible, and also moving/adding links to
    other item types to the "controls" section.
  * Moved calendar cell marking logic from the event
    template to a special transformation used in the editor
    resource. Added marking of cells to the items calendar
    view.
  * Fixed POST request direction to viewers where filtering
    is in use.
  * Fixed hCalendar information in the item list view, and
    added such information to the item calendar view.
  * Changed calendar month navigation in the event editor
    view, requiring the reselection of dates where month
    navigation occurs, since this makes the behaviour of the
    application somewhat more predictable.
