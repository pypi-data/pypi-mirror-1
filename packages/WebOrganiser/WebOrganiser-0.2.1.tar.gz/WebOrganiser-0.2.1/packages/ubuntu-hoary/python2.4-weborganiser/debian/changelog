weborganiser (0.2.1-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

    TopLevelSelector class.

weborganiser (0.2-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Moved RDFAccess to the new WebOrganiser package.
  * Reduced dependencies on RDFCalendar, specifically
    changing RDFAccess to use a generic store (with certain
    conveniences) and specially registered handlers, of
    which RDFCalendar is one.
  * Added WebCalendarPortal - an alternative presentation of
    calendar data.
  * Fixed URL-encoding of / and # characters.
  * Fixed PROPFIND responses, particularly those for
    collection export resources, leaf resources and paths
    employed in the root template.
  * Made /date/year redirect to /date/year/.
  * Added free/busy information export.
  * Reverted date marking (next day values) in the event
    editing mechanisms in order to simplify date
    verification and to prevent the introduction of invalid
    dates.
  * Changed much of the querying to use RDFFormats
    mechanisms.
  * Introduced a "root" URL setting to make images available
    from a common location, thus improving efficiency and
    performance.

weborganiser (0.1.4-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Added options to change the application server's
    address.
  * Rearranged the URL namespace so that filtering must be
    combined with type-related path components, thus
    permitting the viewing of different item types in
    conjunction with filters along, with the creation of new
    items conforming to the filter criteria (currently only
    related-to criteria).
  * Introduced created, dtstamp and related-to information
    into new items, adding the missing related-to element to
    events.
  * Added checks to new event and to-do item creation,
    ensuring that they employ URIRef rather than BNode
    objects, since such items may be referenced by other
    items.
  * Added a new "continued" image, used in the item calendar
    view to more easily distinguish continued events from
    other items.
  * Fixed the WebDAV views to show proposed filtering items,
    resulting filtered information, and other navigation
    criteria correctly, according to the revised URL
    namespace.
  * Changed timestamps to use UTC.
  * Added journal support.
  * Introduced sqltriples-based querying for filter
    operations.
  * Added navigation between list and calendar views.
  * Improved translations in various screens.
  * Made resource selection stricter, causing HTTP 404
    responses for inappropriate URLs.
  * Improved month navigation in the event (and journal)
    editors, also providing a visual indication of the day
    today.

weborganiser (0.1.2-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Improved handling of imported resources, returning more
    accurate (or more conformant) status codes.
  * Simplified person searching in event and to-do item
    editing; added person details to the retrieved person
    items by merging in their contact details.
  * Added event, to-do item and card creation in the
    calendar view (fixing redirects in the item list view).
  * Added a check to prevent cards being created without
    some kind of URIRef being defined. Other item types are
    also likely to have similar restrictions applied.
  * Changed the identifier scheme so that URI references for
    items belonging to a store have unprefixed identifiers,
    and all other items have prefixed identifiers of some
    kind.
  * Introduced URIRef-based property values, requiring
    various changes in the filtering mechanisms (such as
    "related-to" and "person").
  * Provided translations for various screens.
  * Added images to the various summary screens, adjusting
    the layout and moving table headers to the "controls"
    section where possible, and also moving/adding links to
    other item types to the "controls" section.
  * Moved calendar cell marking logic from the event
    template to a special transformation used in the editor
    resource. Added marking of cells to the items calendar
    view.
  * Fixed POST request direction to viewers where filtering
    is in use.
  * Fixed hCalendar information in the item list view, and
    added such information to the item calendar view.
  * Changed calendar month navigation in the event editor
    view, requiring the reselection of dates where month
    navigation occurs, since this makes the behaviour of the
    application somewhat more predictable.
