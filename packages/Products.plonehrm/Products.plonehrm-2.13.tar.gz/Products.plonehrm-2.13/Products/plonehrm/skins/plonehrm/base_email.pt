This page defines macros for mails sent by Plone HRM.

We define 3 macros:
- plonehrm_mail which is the wrapper for the mail. It defines two
slots, 'title' and 'content'.
title is not the subject of the mail, just a sentence that can be
displayed on top of the mail. It is not displayed by default, but we
keep it for eventual HTML mail templates that can use it as headers.

- plonehrm_link: it needs two variables (link_href and link_text) and
transforms it into a link.

- plonehrm_p: it defines a slot 'content' and can be used to
produce "p" tags inside your mails.
