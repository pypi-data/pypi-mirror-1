Description: Plone HRM basic product
        =======================
        
        `plonehrm` is a product that aims to be an extensible basis for simple
        HRM applications. Small firms, possibly divided into a couple of
        worklocations or other business units. Each with a couple of
        employees.
        
        The actual functionality like address data, contracts, financial
        information and so must be provided by separate so-called **employee
        modules**.
        
        It runs on Plone 3.0.
        
        
        What plonehrm provides
        ----------------------
        
        - The basic content types "worklocation" and "employee".
        
        - An interface to which employee modules must conform.
        
        - The content types have the capability to visualise themselves using
        the available employee modules.
        
        - A portal_tool you can use: to register employee modules; to get a
        list of those employee modules; to get a list of all employees.
        
        
        Upgrade information
        -------------------
        
        Between version 1.0 and 2.0 the plonehrm.personaldata module was
        merged into Products.plonehrm.  You need to run some upgrade steps for
        this.  With Plone 3.3 you can do this from the Add/Remove products
        panel.  In earlier Plone versions, go to the Zope Management
        interface, then portal_setup, then the Upgrades tab, choose the
        Products.plonehrm:default profile and run the upgrade steps.
        
        
        History of Products.plonehrm
        ============================
        
        2.1.5 (2009-05-29)
        ------------------
        
        - Depend on plonehrm.absence>=1.0b5 and plonehrm.contracts>=2.0.4.
        [maurits]
        
        - Added contract_expirydate to substitution parameters.
        [maurits]
        
        - Added previous_contract_start_date to substitution parameters.
        [maurits]
        
        - Added migration for the change in the gender and civilStatus
        vocabularies.  We can only make this an example migration that
        happens to work with the Dutch values we filled in in the
        personaldata_properties sheet.  [maurits]
        
        - Made the gender field of an Employee just use strings and a
        DisplayList that can be translated, instead of reading from the
        personaldata_properties.  Substitution view is fixed for that.
        Same for the civil status field (which is not used in substitution btw).
        [maurits]
        
        - Added notedays class to plonehrm.css. [mike]
        
        - Added the possibility to upload files directly from the employee
        view. KSS rules are used to display a form instead of the file
        list. [vincent]
        
        - Added a plonehrm_tool_workflow for our three tools (ChecklistTool,
        ContractTool, JobPerformanceTool).  [maurits]
        
        - Now, the File viewlet shows icon, size and date of the files. The
        files are now sorted (most recent first). The file_list() in the
        method has been changed to return brains instead of
        objects. [vincent]
        
        - removed  css hack absence viewlet (gave problems, wasn't needed),
        removed fixed width .notedate. [laurens]
        
        2.1.4 (2009-05-26)
        ------------------
        
        - Absence viewlet css for edit cel, and min-width for viewlet. [laurens]
        
        - Absenceview css for layout display. [laurens]
        
        - Files viewlet title is now 'Files', instead of 'Add new file'
        [vincent]
        
        - We depend on plonehrm.absence (bigger than or equal to 1.0b4) again
        as that has seen its big refactoring.  Needs a new plonehrm.absence
        release.  [maurits]
        
        - Do not use a workflow for the types defined in plonehrm.absence.
        [maurits]
        
        - Fixed substitution when the context is not a direct child of an
        Employee but is a bit further down.  [maurits+vincent]
        
        - Explicitly load some css and javascript in employee.pt so the kss
        calendar when adding an absence (if plonehrm.absence is used) works.
        [maurits]
        
        - Added xm.theme print.css styles. [laurens]
        
        - Added clean print.css. [laurens]
        
        
        2.1.3 (2009-05-15)
        ------------------
        
        - Do not depend on plonehrm.absence anymore, as that will be changed
        radically.  [maurits]
        
        - During substitution, we substitute None with an ellipsis instead of
        'None'.  [maurits+mike]
        
        - Added icon and link to delete files. [mark + vincent]
        
        - Added icon images (doc, excel, pdf) and metadata. [laurens]
        
        - Renamed substitution parameters so all employee related parameters
        start with '_employee', etc.  [maurits]
        
        - Work Location: added fields for company (or main office) address;
        changed label/description of the current address fields to mean the
        visiting address of the actual work location.  [maurits]
        
        - Removed .mo files from locales.  This means those translations will
        not be visible in the old Plone 3.0.  [maurits]
        
        - Changed label of Title field of Work location into Trade Name.
        [maurits]
        
        
        2.1.2 (2009-05-06)
        ------------------
        
        - Added in_worklocation and all_worklocations methods to worklocation
        state view. [mark]
        
        - Added worklocation state view. [mark]
        
        - Added margin-top to #absencelist .context buttons. [laurens]
        
        - Removed margins .plone_jscalenader. [laurens]
        (didns't traverse in kantoor-ladage theme). [laurens]
        
        - Changed message id for closing_absence (alt & title). [laurens]
        
        - Increased margin-bottom for calendar in viewlet absencelist. [laurens]
        
        - Added class context to button notes and checklist templates. [laurens]
        
        
        2.1.1 (2009-04-22)
        ------------------
        
        - Nothing changed yet.
        
        
        2.1.0 (2009-04-22)
        ------------------
        
        - Added plonehrm.absence in the list of employee details viewlets.
        [maurits+mike]
        
        - Added plonehrm.absence dependency in setup.py. [maurits]
        
        
        2.0 (2009-04-20)
        ----------------
        
        - Nothing changed yet.
        
        
        2.0rc2 (2009-04-16)
        -------------------
        
        - Avoid throwing errors when the 'Migrate personal data' upgrade step
        tries to migrate employees that are already migrated and have no
        personal object anymore.  [maurits]
        
        - Removed the code that ran the upgrade steps automatically when
        (re)installing Products.plonehrm.  It is not what I would expected
        (though I added it myself last year and it does work).  [maurits]
        
        
        2.0rc1 (2009-04-16)
        -------------------
        
        - Require plonehrm.contracts 2.0 or higher.  [maurits]
        
        - Require plonehrm.personaldata 2.0 or higher.  [maurits]
        
        - Catch ValueError in the updateEmployee function when we try to add
        an instance of a content type that does not exist.  [maurits+mike]
        
        - Moved GenericSetup stuff from configure.zcml to the new
        profiles.zcml.  [maurits+mike]
        
        - Added an upgrade step to remove old import step from
        plonehrm.personaldata.  [maurits+mike]
        
        - Added an upgrade step to remove remove 'PersonalData,personal' from
        the portal_types_to_create property.  [maurits+mike]
        
        - In the upgrade step remove the 'personal' object from all
        Employees.  [maurits+mike]
        
        - migrated plonehrm.personaldata.notifications from
        plonehrm.personaldata.notifications to
        Products.plonehrm.notifications [maurits+mike]
        
        - Removed PersonalData from the types that we create in each Employee.
        [maurits, jladage]
        
        - added migration code for the merge of personaldata objects
        into the employee objects.  [maurits+mike]
        
        - If there is no contract workStartDate will still give a date whitch
        calculates te years a employee works at the company.
        
        - In the Plonehrm.contracts added the years and months the employee is
        at the company. When the workStartDate is filled in in personal edit
        that is the date the employee started working at the company.[mike]
        
        - added validator.py with DateValidator,AgeValidator to
        Products.plonehrm\Products\plonehrm witch will check the date when
        adding new employees birthday, workStartDate to not be in the future.
        And will check employees workStartDate to not be too young.[mike]
        
        - workStartDate is added to employee.py in content so you can see when
        the employee stared working at a company.[mike]
        
        - employeeNumber is added to employee.py in content so the employees
        now have numbers in front of their name.[mike]
        
        - Many files of Plonehrm.personal were copyed too Products.plonehrm,
        such as the content types and browser templates.[mike]
        
        - Depend on the new collective.autopermission from Martin Aspeli for
        defining new permissions, getting rid of a hack we needed to do.
        [maurits]
        
        
        1.0.4 (2009-02-16)
        ------------------
        
        - Bug fix: load plone.app.portlets zcml in browser/configure.zcml
        before defining a portlet.  Gave startup problems otherwise for some
        people.  [maurits]
        
        
        1.0.3 (2008-11-21)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed possible unicode error in the substituter.  [maurits]
        
        - Fixed possible unicode error when rendering the title or official
        name of an employee.  [maurits]
        
        
        1.0.2 (2008-10-20)
        ------------------
        
        - Setting plonehrm as placeful workflow for all existing WorkLocations
        is now a GenericSetup upgrade step, which is run by reinstalling.
        [maurits]
        
        - In the plonehrm placeful workflow, explicitly give Files and Images
        the Default workflow.  Otherwise they will still be
        visible/searchable.  [maurits]
        
        - Added placeful workflow 'plonehrm'.  This is set when creating a
        WorkLocation.  Using this gives every content item the
        worklocation_workflow, except Employees who get the
        employee_workflow.  Upon reinstall this policy is set in all
        WorkLocations.  [maurits]
        
        
        1.0.1 (2008-10-10)
        ------------------
        
        - Bug fix: load plone.app.portlets zcml before loading our zcml to avoid
        Zope startup error on some computers.  Thanks to davideilmore for
        finding this.  [maurits]
        
        - End-of-line and svn:ignore fixes.  [maurits]
        
        
        1.0 (2008-10-02)
        ----------------
        
        - Added notification control panel.  [maurits]
        
        - Added profiles/default/metadata.xml.  [maurits]
        
        
        1.0 beta 4 (2008-09-02)
        -----------------------
        
        - Eggified: now available as Products.plonehrm on the python cheese
        shop.  [maurits]
        
        - Fixed the email_adresses_of_local_managers function in utils.py so
        it correctly gets email addresses and full names of members.  [maurits]
        
        
        1.0 beta 3 (2008-07-28)
        -----------------------
        
        - Only test setup + pep8/pyflakes changes. [reinout]
        
        
        1.0 beta
        --------
        
        
        - Make Employee searchable and add its title to the searchable text.
        [maurits]
        
        - Added substitution parameters 'trial_period' and
        'contract_duration'.  [maurits]
        
        - Added tests for the workflows.  [reinout]
        
        - Added first workflow: active/inactive for employee. This also adds
        the roles hrm_manager, worklocation_manager and
        worklocation_employee. Still old-fashioned 2.5 workflow code,
        though.  [reinout]
        
        - First version of working worklocation view with rendering of
        employee modules.  [reinout]
        
        - Removed interface.
        Using configuration now to handle the title/url/template/etc for use
        in the employee_view, instead of relying on methods in the employee
        modules. Should get rid of some serious amount of code.  [reinout]
        
        - Added a few fields that can come in handy for contracts: official
        name of the worklocation, address.  [reinout]
        
        - Removed dependency on utility, the view now grabs objects that can
        be adapted to IEmployeeModule and filters out employee modules in
        that way. Later on, some caching is probably needed: objectValues()!
        [reinout]
        
        - Moved Description to the end of the fields and added
        initials. And.... started this changelog :-) [reinout]
