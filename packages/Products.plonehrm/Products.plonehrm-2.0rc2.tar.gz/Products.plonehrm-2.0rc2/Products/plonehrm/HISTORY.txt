History of Products.plonehrm
============================

2.0rc2 (2009-04-16)
-------------------

- Avoid throwing errors when the 'Migrate personal data' upgrade step
  tries to migrate employees that are already migrated and have no
  personal object anymore.  [maurits]

- Removed the code that ran the upgrade steps automatically when
  (re)installing Products.plonehrm.  It is not what I would expected
  (though I added it myself last year and it does work).  [maurits]


2.0rc1 (2009-04-16)
-------------------

- Require plonehrm.contracts 2.0 or higher.  [maurits]

- Require plonehrm.personaldata 2.0 or higher.  [maurits]

- Catch ValueError in the updateEmployee function when we try to add
  an instance of a content type that does not exist.  [maurits+mike]

- Moved GenericSetup stuff from configure.zcml to the new
  profiles.zcml.  [maurits+mike]

- Added an upgrade step to remove old import step from
  plonehrm.personaldata.  [maurits+mike]

- Added an upgrade step to remove remove 'PersonalData,personal' from
  the portal_types_to_create property.  [maurits+mike]

- In the upgrade step remove the 'personal' object from all
  Employees.  [maurits+mike]

- migrated plonehrm.personaldata.notifications from 
  plonehrm.personaldata.notifications to 
  Products.plonehrm.notifications [maurits+mike]
	
- Removed PersonalData from the types that we create in each Employee.
  [maurits, jladage]

- added migration code for the merge of personaldata objects
  into the employee objects.  [maurits+mike]

- If there is no contract workStartDate will still give a date whitch
  calculates te years a employee works at the company.

- In the Plonehrm.contracts added the years and months the employee is 
  at the company. When the workStartDate is filled in in personal edit
  that is the date the employee started working at the company.[mike]

- added validator.py with DateValidator,AgeValidator to 
  Products.plonehrm\Products\plonehrm witch will check the date when 
  adding new employees birthday, workStartDate to not be in the future.
  And will check employees workStartDate to not be too young.[mike]  

- workStartDate is added to employee.py in content so you can see when
  the employee stared working at a company.[mike]

- employeeNumber is added to employee.py in content so the employees 
  now have numbers in front of their name.[mike]

- Many files of Plonehrm.personal were copyed too Products.plonehrm, 
  such as the content types and browser templates.[mike]

- Depend on the new collective.autopermission from Martin Aspeli for
  defining new permissions, getting rid of a hack we needed to do.
  [maurits]


1.0.4 (2009-02-16)
------------------

- Bug fix: load plone.app.portlets zcml in browser/configure.zcml
  before defining a portlet.  Gave startup problems otherwise for some
  people.  [maurits]


1.0.3 (2008-11-21)
------------------

- Fixed possible unicode error in the substituter.  [maurits]

- Fixed possible unicode error when rendering the title or official
  name of an employee.  [maurits]


1.0.2 (2008-10-20)
------------------

- Setting plonehrm as placeful workflow for all existing WorkLocations
  is now a GenericSetup upgrade step, which is run by reinstalling.
  [maurits]

- In the plonehrm placeful workflow, explicitly give Files and Images
  the Default workflow.  Otherwise they will still be
  visible/searchable.  [maurits]

- Added placeful workflow 'plonehrm'.  This is set when creating a
  WorkLocation.  Using this gives every content item the
  worklocation_workflow, except Employees who get the
  employee_workflow.  Upon reinstall this policy is set in all
  WorkLocations.  [maurits]


1.0.1 (2008-10-10)
------------------

- Bug fix: load plone.app.portlets zcml before loading our zcml to avoid
  Zope startup error on some computers.  Thanks to davideilmore for
  finding this.  [maurits]

- End-of-line and svn:ignore fixes.  [maurits]


1.0 (2008-10-02)
----------------

- Added notification control panel.  [maurits]

- Added profiles/default/metadata.xml.  [maurits]


1.0 beta 4 (2008-09-02)
-----------------------

- Eggified: now available as Products.plonehrm on the python cheese
  shop.  [maurits]

- Fixed the email_adresses_of_local_managers function in utils.py so
  it correctly gets email addresses and full names of members.  [maurits]


1.0 beta 3 (2008-07-28)
-----------------------

- Only test setup + pep8/pyflakes changes. [reinout]


1.0 beta
--------


- Make Employee searchable and add its title to the searchable text.
  [maurits]

- Added substitution parameters 'trial_period' and
  'contract_duration'.  [maurits]

- Added tests for the workflows.  [reinout]

- Added first workflow: active/inactive for employee. This also adds
  the roles hrm_manager, worklocation_manager and
  worklocation_employee. Still old-fashioned 2.5 workflow code,
  though.  [reinout]

- First version of working worklocation view with rendering of
  employee modules.  [reinout]

- Removed interface.
  Using configuration now to handle the title/url/template/etc for use
  in the employee_view, instead of relying on methods in the employee
  modules. Should get rid of some serious amount of code.  [reinout]

- Added a few fields that can come in handy for contracts: official
  name of the worklocation, address.  [reinout]

- Removed dependency on utility, the view now grabs objects that can
  be adapted to IEmployeeModule and filters out employee modules in
  that way. Later on, some caching is probably needed: objectValues()!
  [reinout]

- Moved Description to the end of the fields and added
  initials. And.... started this changelog :-) [reinout]
