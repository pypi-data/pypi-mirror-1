Description: Plone HRM basic product
        =======================
        
        `plonehrm` is a product that aims to be an extensible basis for simple
        HRM applications. Small firms, possibly divided into a couple of
        worklocations or other business units. Each with a couple of
        employees.
        
        The actual functionality like address data, contracts, financial
        information and so must be provided by separate so-called **employee
        modules**.
        
        It runs on Plone 3.0.
        
        
        What plonehrm provides
        ----------------------
        
        - The basic content types "worklocation" and "employee".
        
        - An interface to which employee modules must conform.
        
        - The content types have the capability to visualise themselves using
        the available employee modules.
        
        - A portal_tool you can use: to register employee modules; to get a
        list of those employee modules; to get a list of all employees.
        
        
        Upgrade information
        -------------------
        
        Between version 1.0 and 2.0 the plonehrm.personaldata module was
        merged into Products.plonehrm.  You need to run some upgrade steps for
        this.  With Plone 3.3 you can do this from the Add/Remove products
        panel.  In earlier Plone versions, go to the Zope Management
        interface, then portal_setup, then the Upgrades tab, choose the
        Products.plonehrm:default profile and run the upgrade steps.

        employees. [vincent]
        
        - Added base_edit class, which provides some help to create edit form

        - Hidden Workflow menu for employees. [vincent]

        - Changed release number (issues fixing release). [vincent]
        
        
        2.8 (2009-09-02)
        ----------------
        
        - In the worklocation/absence view, the number of days absent is now
        computed more efficiently for Arbo managers. [vincent]
        
        - Code refactoring to compute absence length for Arbo
        managers. [vincent]
        
        - Added CSV export for absences from worklocation/absence
        view. [vincent]
        
        - In the checker for nearing birth days, do not warn about unknown
        birth days, but log it as a debug message.
        [maurits]
        
        - changes some dutch translations into proper dutch. [mirella]
        
        - Bugfix: it is now possible to upload file with Safari. [vincent]
        
        - Added new way to compute absence days/percentage in worklocation

        provided by the users, but uses calendar and how hours are spread in
        the contracts and letter. [vincent]
        
        - Added ArboManager role and 'plonehrm: manage Arbo content'
        permission. For the moment, this permission only allows to spread
        hours more efficiently in contracts. [vincent]
        
        
        2.7 (2009-08-26)

        - Added a new column in worklocation absences view that displays
        number of absences for the current year. [vincent]
        
        - Added function apply_template_of_tool in utils.py.  This will be
        called by other packages to set the text (of e.g. a job performance
        interview) based on the chosen template, without needing a
        setTemplate method that can have unwanted side effects.
        [maurits]
        
        
        2.6.3 (2009-08-24)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed the validator for Dutch social security numbers.
        [maurits]
        
        - Removed properties.xml as it was still adding the old style
        portlet_parameters portlet in the right slots on the root of the
        site.  (To do: turn this into a proper new style portlet.)
        [maurits]
        
        
        2.6.2 (2009-08-17)
        ------------------
        
        - Moved the properties show_state, show_country,
        civil_status_vocabulary and id_type_vocabulary from
        propertiestool.xml to config.py and setuphandlers.py.  Reinstalling
        should not override user changes.  [maurits]
        
        
        2.6.1 (2009-08-14)
        ------------------
        
        - Let the Template content type use the portal factory.
        [maurits]
        
        
        2.6 (2009-08-13)
        ----------------
        
        - Added 'Contact person' in worklocation archetype, and
        [worklocation_contactperson] template field which fetches
        it. [vincent]
        
        - Added [first_contract_startdate] template field. [vincent]
        
        - Updated [employee_initials] template field. It now automatically
        computes initials from employee's first name. [vincent]
        
        - When adding an end employment date to an employee, default end
        employment items are copied in his checklist. [vincent]
        
        - Added annotations to store reason and date of employment
        end.[vincent]
        
        - Updated CSS for portal_checklist managment page. [vincent]
        
        
        2.5.1 (2009-08-05)
        ------------------
        
        - bugfix in employeesOverview migration. [vincent]
        
        
        2.5 (2009-08-05)
        ----------------
        
        - CSS file for jQuery UI calendar picker is not mergeable anymore,
        which makes images to change month visible again. [vincent]
        
        - Updated default view of a worklocation. Now the checklist column is
        not visible anymore and three more columns have been added (address,
        zipcode and city). You need to run the upgrade step to see the
        changes. [vincent]
        
        - Added insurance information for the worklocation. [vincent]
        
        - Added the 'checklist' page. This page display tasks for all
        employees the user has access to, depending on the context. If the
        page is called inside a worklocation, only tasks of employee in this
        worklocation will be displayed. This page also allows to change date
        of tasks and to check them. [vincent]
        
        
        2.4.1 (2009-07-29)
        ------------------
        
        - Bug fix: absences workflow did not work with third party tool using
        ploneHRM. Corrected mapping in
        profiles/default/workflows.xml. [jladage+vincent]
        
        
        2.4 (2009-07-29)
        ----------------
        
        - Added two-state workflow for absences. An absence can now be
        'opened' or 'closed'. When closed, only the manager (not HRM
        manager) can edit an absence. The absence state automattically
        changes when the user sets an end date using the absence viewlet.
        A migration step has also been added to set the right state for
        absences which have an end date. [vincent]
        
        - A status message is displayed when a file is uploaded from the
        employee view. [vincent]
        
        - Added BSN validator, and used it on the BSN field of employees. [vincent]
        
        - Updated translations [jladage]
        
        
        2.3.1 (2009-07-24)
        ------------------
        
        - Added css for checklist notelist. [laurens]
        
        - bug fix: solved weird cases in worklocation absence view. Now we can
        not have more than 100% of absence during the year and the
        computation of absences days only starts on the first day covered by
        the contract. [vincent]
        
        - Added headers in checklist notelist, including translations and css. [laurens]
        
        
        2.3 (2009-07-22)
        ----------------
        
        - Added 'manage HRM content' permission. [mark+vincent]
        
        - Updated substitution system to deal with the new portal_absence. So
        now, when providing the parameters, it does not only check that
        'portal_jobperformance' is not in the context URL, but checks that
        the context is a contract or a letter. Also added a verification on
        the dictionary access in the 'substitute' method to avoid raising
        exceptions. [vincent]
        
        - Added a migration step to remove old Documents templates and creates
        new ones with the right Archetype. [vincent]
        
        - Added the 'Template' archetype, that will be use to manage every
        type of template (contracts, letter, job performance and absence
        evaluation) used in ploneHRM. [vincent]
        
        
        2.2.9 (2009-07-10)
        ------------------
        
        - Added '1 week' to the pay period options of a work location.
        [maurits]
        
        
        2.2.8 (2009-07-07)
        ------------------
        
        - Reverted changes from 2.2.7: having three names is just too silly.
        [maurits]
        
        
        2.2.7 (2009-07-07)
        ------------------
        
        - Added tradeName field to Worklocation.  The title field is now used
        as the name of the work location.  Then we still have the legal
        name; apparently one name is not enough...  [maurits]
        
        
        2.2.6 (2009-07-07)
        ------------------
        
        - Added upgrade step to replace old substitution parameters within the
        tools templates.  [maurits+markvl]
        
        - Added field payPeriod to WorkLocation.  Vocabulary: month or 4
        weeks.  Added substitution parameter worklocation_pay_period.
        [maurits]
        
        - Substitution: added employee_first_name and employee_full_name.
        [maurits+markvl]
        
        - Substitution: renamed company_official_name to company_legal_name.
        [maurits+markvl]
        
        - Disabled floats for the elements inside the fields for editing the profile
        image of an employee. [laurens]
        
        - Don't use the plural "days" if the employee is sick for just one
        day. [markvl]
        
        - The percentage of absence for an employee is now displayed in the
        absence view of the worklocation, instead of the absence viewlet in
        the employee view. [vincent]
        
        - Added a new upgrade step that reindex all employees. This allows to
        display the facebook, as this one uses metadata that were not
        indexed previously. [vincent]
        
        - Added a facebook. Each employee has a portrait that can be set with
        his personal data. This portrait is displayed in the Employee
        viewlet and a special view has been created in the WorkLocation
        view, allowing to display portraits of all active employees. [vincent]
        
        
        2.2.5 (2009-06-23)
        ------------------
        
        - Updated translations and remove link to folder_contents. [jladage]
        
        
        2.2.4 (2009-06-16)
        ------------------
        
        - Removed the brachets that where used in absencelist overview for
        the dates. [laurens]
        
        
        2.2.3 (2009-06-15)
        ------------------
        
        - Avoid possible ZeroDevisionError in absence list per work location.
        [maurits]
        
        
        2.2.2 (2009-06-15)
        ------------------
        
        - Transparancy fix bullet image.  [laurens]
        
        
        2.2.1 (2009-06-15)
        ------------------
        
        - Removed the bracets for the dates. [laurens]
        
        - Added calculation for sickness per month.  [maurits]
        
        - Added bullet image for use in non-list modules, modified the css
        to display the change correctly. [laurens]
        
        - ccs fix content .notelist, css portlet-parameters. [laurens]
        
        - Changed h2 to h3 in checklisttools_view. [laurens]
        
        - Added the skeleton for the Absence listing at the worklocation level.
        to be continued. [jladage]
        
        - Restructured layout contract viewlet. [jean-paul, laurens]
        
        - Call the method to update an employee only when the object has been
        initialized, not everytime it is modified.  Do not use
        events.employeeModified anymore (removed that) but just use the
        utils.updateEmployee method directly (which now accepts an optional
        event argument and happily ignores it).  Mostly this gets rid of
        Checklist that ended up in the portal_catalog with as parent an
        Employee that was still in the portal_factory.
        [maurits]
        
        - Pagetemplate and css modifications for viewlets file, jobpreformance,
        contract. [laurens]
        
        - Catch AttributeErrors and KeyErrors thrown by brain.getObject().
        [maurits]
        
        
        2.2 (2009-06-12)
        ----------------
        
        - css checklist viewlet. [laurens]
        
        - Removed red color from contract letter, restructured the file viewlet. [laurens]
        
        
        2.1.10 (2009-06-11)
        -------------------
        
        - Restructured the layout of absence_viewlet. [laurens]
        
        
        2.1.9 (2009-06-09)
        ------------------
        
        - Do not allow adding Files to a worklocation and do not show
        non-Employee items there.  [maurits+jladage]
        
        - Removed reference to ManagementFile.  [maurits+jladage]
        
        - Disallow adding the PersonalData content type in an Employee, as
        that is deprecated.  [maurits]
        
        
        2.1.8 (2009-06-04)
        ------------------
        
        - Improved the migration for genders again.  [maurits]
        
        - Changed birthdate requirement to not required.[mike]
        
        - In utils.py changed age method if check to return a None.
        [mike]
        
        - Fixed the substitution for work location and company address as
        those are just strings now instead of lines.
        [maurits]
        
        - Changed viewlets display in the employee view. Now, the viewlets are
        not floating anymore, but displayed inside two columns. [vincent]
        
        - Removed gender vocabulary from personaldata_properties.
        [maurits]
        
        - Reverted the change in 2.1.5 to the civilStatus field of an
        Employee: use personaldata_properties again.  With migration.
        [maurits]
        
        - Changed order of viewlets again.  [maurits]
        
        - Removed variables from the worklocation workflow so the state dropdown is
        not displayed. [jladage]
        
        
        2.1.7 (2009-06-03)
        ------------------
        
        - Catch Unauthorized exception during adding a WorkLocation when the
        current user does not have the right to get or set the placeful
        workflow policy.  Just use the default then.  [maurits+vincent]
        
        - The WorkLocation type now inheritates from BaseFolder instead of
        ATFolder. This allows to remove dynamic view, and so the 'Display'
        tab. [vincent + fred]
        
        - Moved 'Legal company name' in the worklocation type. Worklocation's
        address and company's address are now StringField. In order to get
        proper values for these fields, you have to run the upgrade
        tool. [vincent + fred]
        
        
        2.1.6 (2009-06-02)
        ------------------
        
        - Removed several other properties from the propertiestool.xml that
        were already in config.py so they only get set once, instead of each
        time the profile is applied.  [maurits+markvl]
        
        - Removed the setting of the viewlets in the plonehrm_properties to
        the setuphandlers in Products.plonehrm, where we only set the order
        once.  [maurits+markvl]
        
        
        2.1.5 (2009-05-29)
        ------------------
        
        - Depend on plonehrm.absence>=1.0b5 and plonehrm.contracts>=2.0.4.
        [maurits]
        
        - Added contract_expirydate to substitution parameters.
        [maurits]
        
        - Added previous_contract_start_date to substitution parameters.
        [maurits]
        
        - Added migration for the change in the gender and civilStatus
        vocabularies.  We can only make this an example migration that
        happens to work with the Dutch values we filled in in the
        personaldata_properties sheet.  [maurits]
        
        - Made the gender field of an Employee just use strings and a
        DisplayList that can be translated, instead of reading from the
        personaldata_properties.  Substitution view is fixed for that.
        Same for the civil status field (which is not used in substitution btw).
        [maurits]
        
        - Added notedays class to plonehrm.css. [mike]
        
        - Added the possibility to upload files directly from the employee
        view. KSS rules are used to display a form instead of the file
        list. [vincent]
        
        - Added a plonehrm_tool_workflow for our three tools (ChecklistTool,
        ContractTool, JobPerformanceTool).  [maurits]
        
        - Now, the File viewlet shows icon, size and date of the files. The
        files are now sorted (most recent first). The file_list() in the
        method has been changed to return brains instead of
        objects. [vincent]
        
        - removed  css hack absence viewlet (gave problems, wasn't needed),
        removed fixed width .notedate. [laurens]
        
        2.1.4 (2009-05-26)
        ------------------
        
        - Absence viewlet css for edit cel, and min-width for viewlet. [laurens]
        
        - Absenceview css for layout display. [laurens]
        
        - Files viewlet title is now 'Files', instead of 'Add new file'
        [vincent]
        
        - We depend on plonehrm.absence (bigger than or equal to 1.0b4) again
        as that has seen its big refactoring.  Needs a new plonehrm.absence
        release.  [maurits]
        
        - Do not use a workflow for the types defined in plonehrm.absence.
        [maurits]
        
        - Fixed substitution when the context is not a direct child of an
        Employee but is a bit further down.  [maurits+vincent]
        
        - Explicitly load some css and javascript in employee.pt so the kss
        calendar when adding an absence (if plonehrm.absence is used) works.
        [maurits]
        
        - Added xm.theme print.css styles. [laurens]
        
        - Added clean print.css. [laurens]
        
        
        2.1.3 (2009-05-15)
        ------------------
        
        - Do not depend on plonehrm.absence anymore, as that will be changed
        radically.  [maurits]
        
        - During substitution, we substitute None with an ellipsis instead of
        'None'.  [maurits+mike]
        
        - Added icon and link to delete files. [mark + vincent]
        
        - Added icon images (doc, excel, pdf) and metadata. [laurens]
        
        - Renamed substitution parameters so all employee related parameters
        start with '_employee', etc.  [maurits]
        
        - Work Location: added fields for company (or main office) address;
        changed label/description of the current address fields to mean the
        visiting address of the actual work location.  [maurits]
        
        - Removed .mo files from locales.  This means those translations will
        not be visible in the old Plone 3.0.  [maurits]
        
        - Changed label of Title field of Work location into Trade Name.
        [maurits]
        
        
        2.1.2 (2009-05-06)
        ------------------
        
        - Added in_worklocation and all_worklocations methods to worklocation
        state view. [mark]
        
        - Added worklocation state view. [mark]
        
        - Added margin-top to #absencelist .context buttons. [laurens]
        
        - Removed margins .plone_jscalenader. [laurens]
        (didns't traverse in kantoor-ladage theme). [laurens]
        
        - Changed message id for closing_absence (alt & title). [laurens]
        
        - Increased margin-bottom for calendar in viewlet absencelist. [laurens]
        
        - Added class context to button notes and checklist templates. [laurens]
        
        
        2.1.1 (2009-04-22)
        ------------------
        
        - Nothing changed yet.
        
        
        2.1.0 (2009-04-22)
        ------------------
        
        - Added plonehrm.absence in the list of employee details viewlets.
        [maurits+mike]
        
        - Added plonehrm.absence dependency in setup.py. [maurits]
        
        
        2.0 (2009-04-20)
        ----------------
        
        - Nothing changed yet.
        
        
        2.0rc2 (2009-04-16)
        -------------------
        
        - Avoid throwing errors when the 'Migrate personal data' upgrade step
        tries to migrate employees that are already migrated and have no
        personal object anymore.  [maurits]
        
        - Removed the code that ran the upgrade steps automatically when
        (re)installing Products.plonehrm.  It is not what I would expected
        (though I added it myself last year and it does work).  [maurits]
        
        
        2.0rc1 (2009-04-16)
        -------------------
        
        - Require plonehrm.contracts 2.0 or higher.  [maurits]
        
        - Require plonehrm.personaldata 2.0 or higher.  [maurits]
        
        - Catch ValueError in the updateEmployee function when we try to add
        an instance of a content type that does not exist.  [maurits+mike]
        
        - Moved GenericSetup stuff from configure.zcml to the new
        profiles.zcml.  [maurits+mike]
        
        - Added an upgrade step to remove old import step from
        plonehrm.personaldata.  [maurits+mike]
        
        - Added an upgrade step to remove remove 'PersonalData,personal' from
        the portal_types_to_create property.  [maurits+mike]
        
        - In the upgrade step remove the 'personal' object from all
        Employees.  [maurits+mike]
        
        - migrated plonehrm.personaldata.notifications from
        plonehrm.personaldata.notifications to
        Products.plonehrm.notifications [maurits+mike]
        
        - Removed PersonalData from the types that we create in each Employee.
        [maurits, jladage]
        
        - added migration code for the merge of personaldata objects
        into the employee objects.  [maurits+mike]
        
        - If there is no contract workStartDate will still give a date whitch
        calculates te years a employee works at the company.
        
        - In the Plonehrm.contracts added the years and months the employee is
        at the company. When the workStartDate is filled in in personal edit
        that is the date the employee started working at the company.[mike]
        
        - added validator.py with DateValidator,AgeValidator to
        Products.plonehrm\Products\plonehrm witch will check the date when
        adding new employees birthday, workStartDate to not be in the future.
        And will check employees workStartDate to not be too young.[mike]
        
        - workStartDate is added to employee.py in content so you can see when
        the employee stared working at a company.[mike]
        
        - employeeNumber is added to employee.py in content so the employees
        now have numbers in front of their name.[mike]
        
        - Many files of Plonehrm.personal were copyed too Products.plonehrm,
        such as the content types and browser templates.[mike]
        
        - Depend on the new collective.autopermission from Martin Aspeli for
        defining new permissions, getting rid of a hack we needed to do.
        [maurits]
        
        
        1.0.4 (2009-02-16)
        ------------------
        
        - Bug fix: load plone.app.portlets zcml in browser/configure.zcml
        before defining a portlet.  Gave startup problems otherwise for some
        people.  [maurits]
        
        
        1.0.3 (2008-11-21)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed possible unicode error in the substituter.  [maurits]
        
        - Fixed possible unicode error when rendering the title or official
        name of an employee.  [maurits]
        
        
        1.0.2 (2008-10-20)
        ------------------
        
        - Setting plonehrm as placeful workflow for all existing WorkLocations
        is now a GenericSetup upgrade step, which is run by reinstalling.
        [maurits]
        
        - In the plonehrm placeful workflow, explicitly give Files and Images
        the Default workflow.  Otherwise they will still be
        visible/searchable.  [maurits]
        
        - Added placeful workflow 'plonehrm'.  This is set when creating a
        WorkLocation.  Using this gives every content item the
        worklocation_workflow, except Employees who get the
        employee_workflow.  Upon reinstall this policy is set in all
        WorkLocations.  [maurits]
        
        
        1.0.1 (2008-10-10)
        ------------------
        
        - Bug fix: load plone.app.portlets zcml before loading our zcml to avoid
        Zope startup error on some computers.  Thanks to davideilmore for
        finding this.  [maurits]
        
        - End-of-line and svn:ignore fixes.  [maurits]
        
        
        1.0 (2008-10-02)
        ----------------
        
        - Added notification control panel.  [maurits]
        
        - Added profiles/default/metadata.xml.  [maurits]
        
        
        1.0 beta 4 (2008-09-02)
        -----------------------
        
        - Eggified: now available as Products.plonehrm on the python cheese
        shop.  [maurits]
        
        - Fixed the email_adresses_of_local_managers function in utils.py so
        it correctly gets email addresses and full names of members.  [maurits]
        
        
        1.0 beta 3 (2008-07-28)
        -----------------------
        
        - Only test setup + pep8/pyflakes changes. [reinout]
        
        
        1.0 beta
        --------
        
        
        - Make Employee searchable and add its title to the searchable text.
        [maurits]
        
        - Added substitution parameters 'trial_period' and
        'contract_duration'.  [maurits]
        
        - Added tests for the workflows.  [reinout]
        
        - Added first workflow: active/inactive for employee. This also adds
        the roles hrm_manager, worklocation_manager and
        worklocation_employee. Still old-fashioned 2.5 workflow code,
        though.  [reinout]
        
        - First version of working worklocation view with rendering of
        employee modules.  [reinout]
        
        - Removed interface.
        Using configuration now to handle the title/url/template/etc for use
        in the employee_view, instead of relying on methods in the employee
        modules. Should get rid of some serious amount of code.  [reinout]
        
        - Added a few fields that can come in handy for contracts: official
        name of the worklocation, address.  [reinout]
        
        - Removed dependency on utility, the view now grabs objects that can
        be adapted to IEmployeeModule and filters out employee modules in
        that way. Later on, some caching is probably needed: objectValues()!
        [reinout]
        
        - Moved Description to the end of the fields and added
        initials. And.... started this changelog :-) [reinout]
