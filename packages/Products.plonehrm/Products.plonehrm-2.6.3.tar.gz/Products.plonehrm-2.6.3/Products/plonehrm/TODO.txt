* completely get rid of plonehrm.personaldata

* Get rid of update_employees in setuphandlers.py.  On each reinstall
  we wake all employees to make sure they have all modules
  (plonehrm_properties.portal_types_to_create).  An upgrade step when
  we add something there is better.  That should then be available for
  third party programmers in an easy way too, so they do not need to
  reinvent the wheel.

* Turn the portlet_parameters portlet into a proper new style portlet.
