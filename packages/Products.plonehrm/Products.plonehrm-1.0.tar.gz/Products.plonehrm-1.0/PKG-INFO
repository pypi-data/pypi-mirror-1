Description: Plone HRM basic product
        =======================
        
        `plonehrm` is a product that aims to be an extensible basis for simple
        HRM applications. Small firms, possibly divided into a couple of
        worklocations or other business units. Each with a couple of
        employees.
        
        The actual functionality like address data, contracts, financial
        information and so must be provided by separate so-called **employee
        modules**.
        
        It runs on Plone 3.0.
        
        
        What plonehrm provides
        ----------------------
        
        - The basic content types "worklocation" and "employee".
        
        - An interface to which employee modules must conform.
        
        - The content types have the capability to visualise themselves using
        the available employee modules.
        
        - A portal_tool you can use: to register employee modules; to get a
        list of those employee modules; to get a list of all employees.
        
        
        History of Products.plonehrm
        ============================
        
        1.0 (2008-10-02)
        ----------------
        
        - Added notification control panel.  [maurits]
        
        - Added profiles/default/metadata.xml.  [maurits]
        
        
        1.0 beta 4 (2008-09-02)
        -----------------------
        
        - Eggified: now available as Products.plonehrm on the python cheese
        shop.  [maurits]
        
        - Fixed the email_adresses_of_local_managers function in utils.py so
        it correctly gets email addresses and full names of members.  [maurits]
        
        
        1.0 beta 3 (2008-07-28)
        -----------------------
        
        - Only test setup + pep8/pyflakes changes. [reinout]
        
        
        1.0 beta
        --------
        
        
        - Make Employee searchable and add its title to the searchable text.
        [maurits]
        
        - Added substitution parameters 'trial_period' and
        'contract_duration'.  [maurits]
        
        - Added tests for the workflows.  [reinout]
        
        - Added first workflow: active/inactive for employee. This also adds
        the roles hrm_manager, worklocation_manager and
        worklocation_employee. Still old-fashioned 2.5 workflow code,
        though.  [reinout]
        
        - First version of working worklocation view with rendering of
        employee modules.  [reinout]
        
        - Removed interface.
        Using configuration now to handle the title/url/template/etc for use
        in the employee_view, instead of relying on methods in the employee
        modules. Should get rid of some serious amount of code.  [reinout]
        
        - Added a few fields that can come in handy for contracts: official
        name of the worklocation, address.  [reinout]
        
        - Removed dependency on utility, the view now grabs objects that can
        be adapted to IEmployeeModule and filters out employee modules in
        that way. Later on, some caching is probably needed: objectValues()!
        [reinout]
        
        - Moved Description to the end of the fields and added
        initials. And.... started this changelog :-) [reinout]
