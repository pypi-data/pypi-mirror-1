History of Products.plonehrm
============================

1.0.4 (2009-02-16)
------------------

- Bug fix: load plone.app.portlets zcml in browser/configure.zcml
  before defining a portlet.  Gave startup problems otherwise for some
  people.  [maurits]


1.0.3 (2008-11-21)
------------------

- Fixed possible unicode error in the substituter.  [maurits]

- Fixed possible unicode error when rendering the title or official
  name of an employee.  [maurits]


1.0.2 (2008-10-20)
------------------

- Setting plonehrm as placeful workflow for all existing WorkLocations
  is now a GenericSetup upgrade step, which is run by reinstalling.
  [maurits]

- In the plonehrm placeful workflow, explicitly give Files and Images
  the Default workflow.  Otherwise they will still be
  visible/searchable.  [maurits]

- Added placeful workflow 'plonehrm'.  This is set when creating a
  WorkLocation.  Using this gives every content item the
  worklocation_workflow, except Employees who get the
  employee_workflow.  Upon reinstall this policy is set in all
  WorkLocations.  [maurits]


1.0.1 (2008-10-10)
------------------

- Bug fix: load plone.app.portlets zcml before loading our zcml to avoid
  Zope startup error on some computers.  Thanks to davideilmore for
  finding this.  [maurits]

- End-of-line and svn:ignore fixes.  [maurits]


1.0 (2008-10-02)
----------------

- Added notification control panel.  [maurits]

- Added profiles/default/metadata.xml.  [maurits]


1.0 beta 4 (2008-09-02)
-----------------------

- Eggified: now available as Products.plonehrm on the python cheese
  shop.  [maurits]

- Fixed the email_adresses_of_local_managers function in utils.py so
  it correctly gets email addresses and full names of members.  [maurits]


1.0 beta 3 (2008-07-28)
-----------------------

- Only test setup + pep8/pyflakes changes. [reinout]


1.0 beta
--------


- Make Employee searchable and add its title to the searchable text.
  [maurits]

- Added substitution parameters 'trial_period' and
  'contract_duration'.  [maurits]

- Added tests for the workflows.  [reinout]

- Added first workflow: active/inactive for employee. This also adds
  the roles hrm_manager, worklocation_manager and
  worklocation_employee. Still old-fashioned 2.5 workflow code,
  though.  [reinout]

- First version of working worklocation view with rendering of
  employee modules.  [reinout]

- Removed interface.
  Using configuration now to handle the title/url/template/etc for use
  in the employee_view, instead of relying on methods in the employee
  modules. Should get rid of some serious amount of code.  [reinout]

- Added a few fields that can come in handy for contracts: official
  name of the worklocation, address.  [reinout]

- Removed dependency on utility, the view now grabs objects that can
  be adapted to IEmployeeModule and filters out employee modules in
  that way. Later on, some caching is probably needed: objectValues()!
  [reinout]

- Moved Description to the end of the fields and added
  initials. And.... started this changelog :-) [reinout]
