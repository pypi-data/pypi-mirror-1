* completely get rid of plonehrm.personaldata

* Get rid of update_employees in setuphandlers.py.  On each reinstall
  we wake all employees to make sure they have all modules
  (plonehrm_properties.portal_types_to_create).  An upgrade step when
  we add something there is better.  That should then be available for
  third party programmers in an easy way too, so they do not need to
  reinvent the wheel.

* The social security number validator is geared towards the Dutch
  situation.  We may want to let this work for other countries as
  well.
