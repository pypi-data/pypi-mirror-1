To localize your help file, create a directory here using the two letter code,
for example France would be 'fr' (It should be the same as the code used in
the locale folder.)
Then copy the files (and the README files) from en into there.
Then edit the files as you want to. Original SVG dev-files will be available on request.
Fonty should now pick your language up and use your help file.
Send us what you have done!
:)
