Description: Manage your fonts on Gnu/Linux.
        NEWS : We now support TTF, OTF, Type1 (PFB, PFA)
        and TTC fonts.
        
        Many designers have collections of font files in big
        directory structures or on other media. Fonty Python
        will let you gather your fonts and structure them
        into collections -- or what I call "Pogs" -- a place
        to keep tyPOGraphy. Well, why not?
        
        Your fonts never move from where they are
        (so don't worry). All that happens is that you select
        fonts visually and place their names into a Pog,
        then you install or uninstall Pogs as you need them.
        No copies of your fonts are made, only links to the
        original files are used to install the fonts.
        
        For example, you might have a Pog called "logos"
        into which you place all the fonts you have of
        company logos. After that, when you need to work
        with those logos, you simply install the 'logos' Pog
        and start your design app!
        
        FP is also great for just looking at fonts wherever
        they are on your computer, without having to install
        them system-wide.
