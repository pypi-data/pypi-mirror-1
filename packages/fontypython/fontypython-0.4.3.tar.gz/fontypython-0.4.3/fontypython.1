.SH NAME
fontypython \- Find, view and manage font files of all kinds.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fontypython
[\fIOPTIONS\fR]... [\fIVIEW\fR]... [\fITARGET\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B fontypython
is a GUI utility written in Python and WxPython that will help you do font stuff on GNU/Linux system. 
You can quickly view and filter arbitrary* TTF, TTC, OTF or Type1 font files and then gather them together into 'Pogs' which can be installed or removed as needed. In this way you control which fonts are installed on a per-project basis.

If you have 
.B gucharmap
or
.B kfontview
installed, (there is an option in Settings to choose which one) you can view any font's character maps etc.

*Arbitrary means you can use 
.B any fonts
in a local directory (or a mount). They 
.B do not need
to be installed on your system.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB VIEW
A place where fonts are. A Pog or a folder someplace.
.TP
\fB TARGET
A "Pog". A place to keep those fonts (just references to them).
.TP
\fB OPTIONS
Below are the various command-line options. You don't need to use them, but they are handy. The program will run as a GUI if you only invoke 'fontypython'. 
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-examples\fR
Show some %$@#$ examples!
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-list\fR
List the names of all the Pogs.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR Pog, \fB\-\-install\fR=\fIPog\fR
Install the fonts in this Pog to your fonts folder.
.TP
\fB\-u\fR Pog, \fB\-\-uninstall\fR=\fIPog\fR
Uninstall the fonts in this Pog.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR Pog, \fB\-\-purge\fR=\fIPog\fR
Purge the Pog of ttf files that are no longer really there.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR "text", \fB\-\-text\fR=\fI"text"\fR
Set a new default sample text. Eg, "This is an ex-parrot".
Be sure to use the quotes.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR num, \fB\-\-size\fR=\fInum\fR
Set a new default point size.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR num, \fB\-\-number\fR=\fInum\fR
Set a new default for how many fonts to view at one go. Don't overdo this.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR folder \fB\-\-check\fR=\fIfolder\fR
Check for bad fonts that crash the program. It will recurse through sub-folders. This will build a file: ~/.fontypython/segfonts After using this tool you should be able to browse safely. (The reason it's not done by default is that it's very slow.)
NOTE: The fonts that crash the program are probably still perfectly good and can be used in other apps.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR folder Pog, \fB\-\-all\fR=\fIfolder Pog\fR
Puts all fonts in this folder into the Pog. If the Pog already exists, it will
add only *new* fonts, this means fonts are not repeated in that Pog.
.TP
\fB\-A\fR folder Pog, \fB\-\-all\-recurse=\fIfolder Pog\fR
Puts all fonts in this folder and *all* sub-folders into the Pog. Rest same as
\-a.
.TP
\fB\-z\fR Pog, \fB\-\-zip=\fIPog\fR
All the fonts inside Pog will be zipped and the zipfile will be named after the
Pog. The file will be placed in the current directory.
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
Show program's version number and exit.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Show help message and exit.
