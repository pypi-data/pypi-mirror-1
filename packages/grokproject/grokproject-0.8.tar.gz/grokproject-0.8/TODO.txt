* zc.buildout has a logging initialization bug (it doesn't tear down
  the logging handler, so subsequent logging calls are multiplied).
  See https://bugs.launchpad.net/zc.buildout/+bug/125729.

* Allow creating projects with dotted names.
  See https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/223560

* Make a template for megrok.something

* WSGI integration (add some lines to buildout.cfg)

* When running the grokproject tests, also run the bin/test of a
  generated project.

* Remove find-links from generated buildout.cfg when grok 0.13 goes
  live.  0.12 depends on find-links to get zope.tal 3.4.0b1 which was
  never released on the cheeseshop.
