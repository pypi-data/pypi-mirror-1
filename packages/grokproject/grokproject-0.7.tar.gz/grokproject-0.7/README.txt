grokproject provides an easy way to get started with a `grok
<http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/grok>`_ web application.  Simply
install ``grokproject``::

  $ easy_install grokproject

and run the ``grokproject`` script with the name of the project you'd
like to create as an argument::

  $ grokproject MammothHerd
  ... many lines of output here

This will not only create a project area for you to work in, it will
also download and install grok and Zope 3 (the application server grok
is built on).

After the project area has been created successfully, you will find an
empty Python package in the ``src`` directory in which you can place
the code for your web application.  To start the Zope server, execute
``bin/zopectl fg``.
