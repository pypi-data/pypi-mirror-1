Changes
=======

0.7 (2008-04-22)
------------------

* Each of the interactive questions can now be set with an commandline
  option.

* No longer ask for the name of the module that will contain the
  grok.Application subclass.  It's 'app.py' by default now, a rename
  is easy enough to do later on.

* Fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/161947: The buildout.cfg
  template contained the [data] section twice.

* Generate ``<includeDependencies package="." />`` statement by default. If
  new dependencies are added to ``setup.py`` that need ZCML, the ZCML
  will be automatically loaded. (Depends on a new release of Grok with
  z3c.autoinclude)


0.6 (2007-10-10)
----------------

* Added include package directive to ftesting.zcml_tmpl to enable functional
  testing of the generated application.

* Updated template for site.zcml, no annoying warning at start.

* Added buildout support for i18n (thanks to lovely.recipe.i18n).

* The buildout.cfg that is created now has an extends directive that points
  to URL of the version.cfg of the current Grok release. This URL can be
  overridden with the --version-info-url commandline option.

  See http://grok.zope.org/releaseinfo/readme.html for more information.

0.5.1 (2007-07-14)
------------------

* Use the new 'application' recipe from zc.zope3recipes so that we can
  get rid of the dead chicken [zope3] section in buildout.cfg.

0.5 (2007-07-14)
----------------

* The bin/instance script has been renamed to bin/zopectl for better
  recognizability.

* grokproject is much quieter by default (by quieting down
  PasteScript, easy_install and zc.buildout).  Use the -v option for
  verbose mode.

* Fixed https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/119805:
  A new project created with grokproject can't be called 'grok' or 'zope'.

* By default, zc.buildout will now be told to place eggs in a
  user-specified shared eggs directory.  Also, it will not look for
  newer versions of existing eggs by default.

0.4 (2007-07-12)
----------------

* As grok now depends on Zope 3.4 eggs, use zc.zope3recipes
  application and instance recipes.

* Don't spawn processes to bootstrap and run the buildout.  Instead,
  try to simply import zc.buildout.  If that doesn't work, call the
  setuptools API to install it and then simply import it.

* Fixed https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/113103:
  Default index template was missing closing html tag.

0.1 thru 0.3
------------

Initial development versions, supporting Zope 3.3.
