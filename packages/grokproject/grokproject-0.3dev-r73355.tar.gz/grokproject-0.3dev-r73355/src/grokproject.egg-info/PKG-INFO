Description: grokproject provides an easy way to get started with a `grok
        <http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/grok>`_ web application.  Simply
        install ``grokproject``::
        
        $ easy_install grokproject
        
        and run the ``grokproject`` script with the name of the project you'd
        like to create as an argument::
        
        $ grokproject MammothHerd
        ... many lines of output here
        
        This will not only create a project area for you to work in, it will
        also download and install grok and Zope 3 (the application server grok
        is built on).
        
        After the project area has been created successfully, you will find an
        empty Python package in the ``src`` directory in which you can place
        the code for your web application.  To start the Zope server, execute
        ``parts/instance/bin/runzope``.
