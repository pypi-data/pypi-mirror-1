Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package allows one to perform various debugging and development actions
        on a running Zope instance.  In order to perform an action one must:
        
        1. Insert a command into a special control file.  To determine which file
        to look in, mr.freeze will take the Zope pid file and replace the
        extension with '.freeze'.  So in a typical buildout the control file
        would be var/instance.freeze
        2. Send a *USR1* signal to the Zope instance.
        
        This pattern is intended to support integration with editors like TextMate
        and emacs, but that hasn't been implemented yet.
        
        
        Commands
        ========
        
        The following commands are currently supported in both debug and non-debug mode.
        
        stack
        Will dump a stack backtrace for all threads to the console.
        (Default command if unable to read freeze file.)
        
        pony
        Will dump a pony to the console.
        
        
        The following commands are supported in debug mode only.
        
        freeze
        Will drop Zope to a pdb debug prompt.
        
        freeze [file] [line #]
        Will set a pdb breakpoint on the specified line.
        
        
        The following commands are planned.
        
        reload code
        Will reload code that has been modified.
        
        reload zcml
        Will reload code and ZCML that has been modified.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.0a2 (2009-03-19)
        ------------------
        
        * Be a little more careful about patching ZPublisher's call_object,
        so that we can coexist with PDBDebugMode.
        
        * Use canonical path of files passed to the freeze command.
        
        * Fixes for TextMate integration script.
