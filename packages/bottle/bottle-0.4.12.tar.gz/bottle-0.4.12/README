Bottle Web Framework
====================

Bottle is a fast and simple mirco-framework for small web-applications. It
offers request dispatching with url parameter support, templates, key/value
databases, a build-in HTTP server and adapters for many third party
WSGI/HTTP-server and template engines. All in a single file and with no
dependencies other than the Python Standard Library.

You can install bottle with `easy_install bottle` or just download bottle.py
and place it in your project directory. There are no (hard) dependencies other
than the Python Standard Library. For news, bugs and documentation
visit my [GitHub repository][www] or the [bottle.py wiki][wiki].

Features
--------

  * Request dispatching: Map requests to handler-callables using URL-routes
    * URL parameters: Use regular expressions `/object/(?P<id>[0-9]+)` or simplified syntax `/object/:id` to extract data out of URLs
  * WSGI abstraction: Don't worry about cgi and wsgi internals
    * Input: `request.GET['parameter']` or `request.POST['form-field']`
    * HTTP header: `response.header['Content-Type'] = 'text/html'`
    * Cookie Management: `response.COOKIES['session'] = 'new_key'`
    * Static files: `send_file('movie.flv', '/downloads/')` with automatic mime-type guessing
    * Errors: Throw HTTP errors using `abort(404, 'Not here')` or subclass `HTTPError` and use custom error handlers
  * Databases: Build in persistent key/value databases with fast memory caching.
    * Use `db.db_name.key_name` or `db[db_name][key_name]` to access stored values. Missing databases are created on demand. Missing keys raise KeyError.
    * Values are automatically pickled and saved at the end of the request live cycle.
  * Templates: Integrated template language
    * Plain simple: Execute python code with `%...` or use the inline syntax `{{...}}` for one-line expressions
    * No IndentationErrors: You donâ€™t have to worry about indentions. Blocks are closed by `%end`.
    * Extremely fast: Parses and renders templates 5 to 10 times faster than [mako][]
    * Optional support for [Mako-Templates][mako] (requires [mako][])
  * HTTP Server: Build in WSGI/HTTP Gateway server (for development and production mode)
    * Currently supports wsgiref.simple_server (default), [cherrypy][], [flup][], [paste][] and [fapws3][]
  * Speed optimisations:
    * Sendfile: Support for platform-specific high-performance file-transmission facilities, such as the Unix sendfile()
      * Depends on `wsgi.file_wrapper` provided by your WSGI-Server implementation.
    * Self optimising routes: Frequently used routes are tested first (optional)
    * Fast static routes (single dict lookup)
  
Bottle does **not** include:

  * Models and ORMs: Choose your own (SQLAlchemy, Elixr)
  * HTML-Helper, Session, Identification and Authentication: Do it yourself
  * Scaffolding: No, sorry

Example
-------

    from bottle import route, run, request, response, send_file, abort, template

    @route('/')
    def hello_world():
        return 'Hello World!'

    @route('/hello/:name')
    def hello_name(name):
        return 'Hello %s!' % name

    @route('/hello', method='POST')
    def hello_post():
        name = request.POST['name']
        return 'Hello %s!' % name

    @route('/static/:filename#.*#')
    def static_file(filename):
        send_file(filename, root='/path/to/static/files/')

    @route('/template/test')
    def template_test():
        return template('template_name', title='Template Test', items=[1,2,3,'fly'])
        
    run(host='localhost', port=8080)

Template example:

    %message = 'Hello world!'
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>{{title.title()}}</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>{{title.title()}}</h1>
        <p>{{message}}</p>
        <p>Items in list: {{len(items)}}</p>
        <ul>
        %for item in items:
          <li>
          %if isinstance(item, int):
            Zahl: {{item}}
          %else:
            %try:
              Other type: ({{type(item).__name__}}) {{repr(item)}}
            %except:
              Error: Item has no string representation.
            %end try-block (yes, you may add comments here)
          %end
          </li>
        %end
        </ul>
      </body>
    </html>
