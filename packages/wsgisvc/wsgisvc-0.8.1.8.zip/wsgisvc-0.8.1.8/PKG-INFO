        =======
        
        There are many deployment scenarios with Python web applications. Without diving into all the options I'll suppose part of your deployment is utilizing Paste Deployment (http://pythonpaste.org/deploy/) . To test and develop your application you use "paster serve some_name.ini". Now to setup the application so that it runs after log off or restart you need a customized Windows service.
        
        There are a couple of recipes around to achieve this but, you have to copy and paste some code and hardcode the name and config file into it. I've put together a little tool which helps creating windows services, based on arbitrary configuration parameters.
        
        1. install the tool
        -------------------
        ::
        
        easy_install wsgisvc
        
        This adds the wsgisvc.exe into your scripts directory.
        
        2. Extend your \*.ini file
        ---------------------------
        
        with a [winservice] section. The list of options you can use:
        
        - svc_name
        - svc_display_name
        - svc_description
        - virtual_env
        
        Only the svc_name option is mandatory. If you don't use svc_display_name or svc_decription sensible default will be made up. The minimal configuration you need to add looks like this::
        
        [winservice]
        svc_name = svc1
        
        3. Install the service
        ----------------------
        ::
        
        wsgisvc -c some_name.ini install
        
        This adds the service "svc1" to your system. You can check it out under display name "svc1 Paste Service" through Administrative Tools -> Services. To start the service you can either use that or command line::
        
        wsgisvc -c some_name.ini start
        
        And the last thing, to list display names of all installed Paste services::
        
        wsgisvc list
