Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        kupu.mashups extends kupu with a new set of tools that enables you to relate
        the content of your documents with additional information from different sources,
        that are integrated in your document view.
        
        
        FEATURES
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        - Information sources: Google Search, Google Maps, Wikipedia.
        - The information is got through Ajax calls and shown in popups.
        
        
        INSTALL
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        Add this to your buildout.cfg::
        
        eggs =
        ${buildout:eggs}
        ${plone:eggs}
        kupu.mashups
        
        zcml =
        kupu.mashups
        
        and then install it with the quickinstaller.
        
        
        CONFIGURATION
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        To use the Google Maps mashup you will need to have an API key
        (see http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html). Once you have a key you
        need to set it in the jsapi.js file located in the skins/kupumashups directory
        of the product.
        You can also change the Wikipedia language version by modifying the variable
        WIKIPEDIA_URL in the config.py in the root of the product (by default, it is
        set to 'http://en.wikipedia.org').
        
        
        NOTE:
        This package overwrites kupu_wysiwyg_support.html to add the new toolbar
        buttons and drawers to KUPU.
