unittest-xml-reporting
----------------------

unittest-xml-reporting is a Python unittest-based test runner that can export
test results to JUnit[1] like XML reports.

The usefulness of such a thing becomes clear when we consider the use of
Continous Integration servers (like Cruise Control[2] and Hudson[3]) to
control the build cycle of our applications.

Since most CI servers are able to parse those JUnit XML reports to know
whether a build fails (and display fancy graphics and statistics, of course),
it would be nice if such features could work for regular Python unittest
TestCases.


Installation and usage
----------------------

Just drop the 'xmlrunner.py' file somewhere inside your PYTHONPATH and you are
ready to go.

To learn how to use the XMLTestRunner please take a look at the scripts
inside the 'examples' folder.
