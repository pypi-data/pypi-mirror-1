Changelog for plone.app.content

    (name of developer listed in brackets)

plone.app.content - 1.1.1

    - Improved the batch disabling action so that it only shows up
      when there is a batch.
      [jvloothuis]

    - Made the reviewlist more powerful by making the folder contents
      selection features available for it as well.
      [jvloothuis]

    - Changed the replacement command to actually replace the div, not
      just its inner content. This fixes a problem with browsers like
      Internet Explorer which did not apply the drag and drop script
      after updating.
      [jvloothuis]

    - Fixed i18n markup in table.pt.

plone.app.content - 1.1.0

    - Made it possible to show all the items in the folder contents at
      once (no batching). This can be used to drag items across batch
      boundaries and makes it easier to move an item from the end of
      the folder to the beginning.
      [jvloothuis]

    - Update the folder_factories view to add the FTI id to the output of 
      of addable_types. This makes it possible for callers to manipulate its
      results.

    - Fixed the 'id' attribute of CMFAdding class. By default, it is an
      empty string, which confuses absolute_url() and causes the <base />
      tag to be set incorrectly. This in turn confuses KSS, and probably
      other things.

plone.app.content - 1.0

    - Fixed missing i18n markup on the folder contents view.
