Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Have you ever feel the need to give to normal (AKA non-manager) Plone member the power to manage a group?
        
        Right now in Plone you can make this possible playin with the **Manage users** and **Manage Groups**
        permissions of the portal (also for Plone 2.5).
        
        What is (obviously) impossible is to limit the group on which a member can add.
        
        This products make something very dangerous: with a minimal configuration a member of the Plone portal
        (or all members in a group) will be able to manage the users of a group overriding the portal security.
        
        The utility also react to the **Add portal members** permission. If the current user has this permission
        you will be able to add new portal members.
        
        Be aware!
        ---------
        
        This products override all normal Plone permissions noted above!
        This can create **security black-holes** in your portal!
