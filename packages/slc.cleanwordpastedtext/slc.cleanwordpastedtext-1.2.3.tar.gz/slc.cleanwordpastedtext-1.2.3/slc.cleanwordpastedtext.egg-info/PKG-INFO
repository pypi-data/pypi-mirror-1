Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This product provides an event subscriber for BaseContent Archetypes objects that will
        clean up the HTML of all the RichText fields for each object.
        
        This is especially a problem when users copy and paste from MSWord into
        FCKEditor.
        
        The operation runs automatically every time an object is created or edited and
        can be disabled/enabled in the Settings fieldset of the object's normal 'edit'
        view.
        
        The cleaning and sanitizing of the HTML code is mainly done by using the lxml library:
        http://codespeak.net/lxml/lxmlhtml.html
        
        
        This Product does not have to be installed via quick_installer or the plone
        control panel.
