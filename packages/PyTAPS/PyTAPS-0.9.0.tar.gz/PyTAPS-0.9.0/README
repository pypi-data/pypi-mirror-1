PyTAPS

Revision 0.9.0, Jan 25, 2010

== Installation ==

PyTAPS requires the following to be installed on your system:
 * Python (2.5+)
 * Numpy
 * At least one of...
   * MOAB (or other iMesh interface)
   * CGM (or other iGeom interface)
   * Lasso (or other iRel interface)

If the include files and libraries are in the default paths for your C 
compiler, then typing `python setup.py install' should be sufficient. PyTAPS
will attempt to deduce the appropriate files to include during compilation by
checking the iXxx-Defs.inc file for each ITAPS interface. If this doesn't work,
you can create a file named `setup.cfg' and enter the appropriate paths and
libraries manually, like so:

----- Begin setup.cfg -----

[build_ext]
include_dirs = folder1:folder2
library_dirs = folder3:folder4
libraries    = lib1:lib2

----- End setup.cfg -----


== Usage ==

For usage examples, consult the files in test/*. For help with using the
interfaces, run `help(itaps.iMesh)' (or similar) from the Python interpreter,
or consult the documentation provided (requires Sphinx to compile them).


== Testing ==

Basic tests of the interfaces are located in test/. To run all tests, run
`python setup.py test'.
