Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package allows developers to define functions and apply them to sets of objects through a zope3 view. The sets of objects can be subtrees of the ZODB, or can be defined by a query to portal_catalog.
        
        To use it, you just have to add two lines to your buildout, one to add yaco.applyfun to the eggs section of the main part ([buildout]), and one in the zcml section of the instance part that has to have the view.
        
        Then, you have de @@applyfun view available on any content.
        
        To add functions, you can define them in the walker_funcs.py module of the product, or you can define them in any other module with the same structure (functions plus a "functions" dict) and plug it in through the config.py module of the product. The docstring of the functions will be available as help in the view.
