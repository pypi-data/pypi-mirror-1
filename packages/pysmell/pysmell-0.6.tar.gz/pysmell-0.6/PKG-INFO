Description: PySmell is a python IDE completion helper.
        
        It tries to statically analyze Python source code, without executing it,
        and generates information about a project's structure that IDE tools can
        use.
        
        The first target is Vim, because that's what I'm using and because its
        completion mechanism is very straightforward, but it's not limited to it.
