rdfcalendar (0.2.4-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Fixed line parsing where CR characters were causing
    textual data to be incorrectly split into lines which
    could not then be correctly parsed.
  * Added a DebugStore for testing purposes.

rdfcalendar (0.2.3-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Updated the RDFFormats dependency to fix the deep
    removal issue properly.

rdfcalendar (0.2.2-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Added "organizer" and "attendee" to the list of
    connector labels, preventing deep removal of related
    resources.

rdfcalendar (0.2.1-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Exclude free/busy items in the calculation of free/busy
    information (RDFCalendar.Writers).

rdfcalendar (0.2-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Introduced a dependency on RDFFormats which provides
    more general support for store-like functionality useful
    for parsers and writers. As a consequence, the interface
    to store functionality is more explicit for parsing
    operations, store-level convenience methods are removed,
    and various "handler" methods are exposed that are
    useful for querying the store about the kinds of nodes
    and namespaces it supports, as well as for performing
    parsing and serialisation operations.
  * Added free/busy export support, along with a simple
    store-like class for the acquisition of free/busy
    request information, and a special writer function for
    writing response information to a stream.
  * Added the rdfcalendar namespace text to the top-level
    RDFCalendar module.
  * Fixed/improved multivalue support, also adding period
    value support.
  * Dropped rdflib support.

rdfcalendar (0.1.4-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Changed make_uid to return supplied "general" URIs as
    usable unique identifiers for the data store. Since the
    returned unique identifiers are otherwise full URIs
    themselves, it is desirable to treat "general" URIs
    equivalently.
  * Fixed the iCalendar import/export tool to work with
    sqltriples 0.2.x.
  * Added a test to prevent (failed) serialisation of
    non-calendar resources.
  * Fixed handling of "end of file" lines without newline
    characters.

rdfcalendar (0.1.3-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Added RDFCalendar.Format.uriref_labels and made certain
    property values URIRef objects rather than Literal
    objects.
  * Changed the RDFCalendar.Store.open convenience function
    to pass on received keyword parameters to sqltriples.

rdfcalendar (0.1.2-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Empty values for related-to properties are no longer
    recorded in the data store.

 -- Paul Boddie <paul@boddie.org.uk>  Sun, 12 Mar 2006 23:10:49 +0100

rdfcalendar (0.1.1-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Added checks for duplicate resources in the parsers,
    raising an exception if an attempt is made to parse a
    resource using an URIRef which is already known to the
    store.

 -- Paul Boddie <paul@boddie.org.uk>  Sun, 12 Mar 2006 22:38:09 +0100

rdfcalendar (0.1-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
