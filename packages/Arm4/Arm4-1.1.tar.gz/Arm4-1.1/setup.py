Python language bindings for the Application Response Measurement (ARM) Version 4.0 standard.

This module provides a Python language implementation of the ARM 4.0
standard. At it's simplest, it's a straight exposure of the C language
bindings with enough concessions to make it fit the Python language.

Usage:

  import arm4

  # Register
  app_id = arm4.register_application ("Python test")
  tran_id = arm4.register_transaction (app_id, "Python hello world")

  # Start our application and transaction measurements
  app_handle = arm4.start_application (app_id, "Example")
  tran_handle = arm4.start_transaction (app_handle, tran_id)

  # Do our work
  print 'Hello, world!'

  # Stop our measurements
  arm4.stop_transaction (tran_handle) # Default status is arm4.ARM_STATUS_GOOD
  arm4.stop_application (app_handle)

  # Finish up
  arm4.destroy_application (app_id)

This is a simple example that doesn't make use of ARM's advanced
correlators or metrics. More examples can be found at http://www.arm4.org

This module is based on the ARM Issue 4.0, Version 2 - C Binding standard. More information
can be found at http://www.opengroup.org/management/arm.htm
