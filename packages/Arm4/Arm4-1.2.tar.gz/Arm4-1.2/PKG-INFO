Description: 
        Python language bindings for the Application Response Measurement (ARM) Version 4.0 standard.
        
        This module provides a Python language implementation of the ARM 4.0
        standard. At it's simplest, it's a straight exposure of the C language
        bindings with enough concessions to make it fit the Python language.
        
        Usage:
        
        import arm4
        
        # Register
        app_id = arm4.register_application ("Python test")
        tran_id = arm4.register_transaction (app_id, "Python hello world")
        
        # Start our application and transaction measurements
        app_handle = arm4.start_application (app_id, "Example")
        tran_handle = arm4.start_transaction (app_handle, tran_id)
        
        # Do our work
        print 'Hello, world!'
        
        # Stop our measurements
        arm4.stop_transaction (tran_handle) # Default status is arm4.ARM_STATUS_GOOD
        arm4.stop_application (app_handle)
        
        # Finish up
        arm4.destroy_application (app_id)
        
        This is a simple example that doesn't make use of ARM's advanced
        correlators or metrics. More examples can be found at http://www.arm4.org
        
        This module is based on the ARM Issue 4.0, Version 2 - C Binding standard. More information
