Description: 
        
        threading2:  like the standard threading module, but awesomer.
        
        This module is designed as a drop-in replacement and extension for the default
        "threading" module.  It has two main objectives:
        
        * implement primitives using native platform functionality where possible
        * expose more sophisticated functionality where if can be done uniformly
        
        The following extensions are currently implemented:
        
        * ability to set (advisory) thread priority
        * thread groups for simultaneous management of multiple threads
        
        The following API niceties are also included:
        
        * all blocking methods take a "timeout" argument and return a success code
        * all exposed objects are actual classes and can be safely subclassed
        
        Planned extensions include:
        
        * ability to set (advisory) thread affinities
        * native events, semaphores and timed waits on win32
        * native conditions and timed waits on pthreads platforms
