Python Page
===========

Python Page provides the user with a content object that interprets
Python in content space.  To save typing and useless messing with
output, any free-standing string and print statement are considered
for output; see the example below.


Example
-------

Create a new content type called "Python Page" and enter the following
code example::

  '''
  <html>
    <body>
      <ul>
  '''

  import time
  print time.asctime()

  '''
      </ul>
    </body>
  </html>
  '''
