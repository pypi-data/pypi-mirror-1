CONFIGURATION TIPS
==================

Q: But I only want content type X or Y (i.e. Event objects) to be configured as RSVP-aware...

A: To limit which content types the user can easily configure as RSVP-aware, the 
condition_expr for the "allowRSVPs" and "disableRSVPs" actions, could be changed to something 
like (replace 'Event' with the name(s) of your preferred content type below):

 condition_expr="python:not object.restrictedTraverse('@@rsvp-configuration').isRSVPEnabled() and object.portal_type in ('Event',) "


Q. Other tips will be added as needed...
