    The 'unittest' directory provided in the original source tarball and in the 
    upstream repository contain all the unit tests needed to prove that the 
    package is working correctly after applying some changes to the code.

    To run all the tests:
        1. Set execute rights on unittest/run_tests.py
                cd unittest
                chmod +x ./run_tests.py
        2. Run run_tests.py
                ./run_tests.py
