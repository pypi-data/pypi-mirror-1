Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package is a bridge between `z3c.caching`_ and `CacheSetup`_: it takes
        rulesets configured via z3c.caching and looks for a rule with the same id
        in your current CacheSetup configuration. That rule is then used to set the
        caching headers for the response.
        
        This makes it possible to cache content which CacheSetup itself can
        not handle (such as browser views).
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        To use ``five.caching`` you need only need to load its zcml.
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        The only thing you need to do to enable five.caching to do its work is loads
        its zcml.
        
        A common problem you might notice is that CacheSetup rules often use
        ``python:object.modified()`` as expression, which does not work with
        all objects supported by `z3c.caching` and `five.caching`. As an alternative
        this package provides a ``lastmodified`` browser view which returns the same
        information. You can use it by configuring ``object/@@lastmodified`` as
        expression in your CacheSetup rules.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.0 - 2009-05-20
        ----------------
        
        * Handle anonymous traffic correctly. CacheFu needs to be passed None and not
        a special user object to use the anonymous rules.
        [hannosch]
        
        * Corrected the `configure.zcml` to include the `plone.postpublicationhook`
        configuration.

        1.0b2 - October 21, 2008
        ------------------------
        
        * Handle instance methods as well. This makes it possible to define cache rules
        for CMF skin objects.
        [wichert]
        
        * Add @@lastmodified helper view.

        ------------------------
