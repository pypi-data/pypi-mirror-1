Installation
------------

Amara requires Python 2.5 or 2.6.  It supports setuptools and easy_install,
so you can just do the following:

easy_install amara

If this does not work you are probably not set up for easy_install and I
suggest you follow the simple instructions at

http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall

If you prefer not to use easy_install, install the Amara package using the usual:

python setup.py install

Or a Windows installer, or other method.

Documentation
-------------

Eventually most distributions/binary packages will allow you to install documentation,
but for now consult the wiki, starting at
