To do
=====

Bindery:
--------

* Add ability to bind from DOM node as well as via SAX
* Beef up XSLT support
* Add system to generate binding rules from RELAX NG
* Catalog support
* streaming c14n support

Scimitar:
---------

* Implement a means for selecting phases
* Versa query hooks for framework
* Fix setup.py so that the module is not duplicated to the script location
  (a minor inconvenience currently)
* Add hook/implementaion for Jeni Tennison's DTLL ( http://www.jenitennison.com/datatypes/ )

It's a tricky question.  The right way to compare XML documents is c14n
[1].  I've long wanted to add c14n to Amara, but I decided to put it off
post 1.0.  I think I should wait to implement such smart comparison
until then.
