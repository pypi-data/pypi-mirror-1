Description: This application enables simple Flash cross-domain access policies for
        Django sites. For example, the following URL pattern is all you'd need
        to set up cross-domain access for Flash files served from your media
        server::
        
        url(r'^crossdomain.xml$',
        'flashpolicies.views.simple',
        { 'domains': ['media.yoursite.com'] }),
        
        Various other views are included, handling other common and
        not-so-common cases.
        
        Also present is a class -- ``flashpolicies.policies.Policy`` -- which
        provides a simple Python API for creating and manipulating
        cross-domain policies, as well as serializing them to the correct
        XML. This class is designed to be useful regardless of whether Django
        is present or used, and depends only on modules available in the
        Python standard library.
        
        Full documentation for all functionality is also included, as well as
        an ever-growing test suite.
