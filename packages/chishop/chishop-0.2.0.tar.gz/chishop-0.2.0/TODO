* Make it possible to register users via distutils.
  (There should be a setting to turn this feature on/off).
* Add a pretty, user-friendly web site interface in addition to
  the API interface.
* Maybe add a permission "can upload new release", so more than one
  user can change the same project.
* Should a project have co-owners?
