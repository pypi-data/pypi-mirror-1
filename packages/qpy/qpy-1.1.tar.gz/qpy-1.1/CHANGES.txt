Version 1.1: 2 November 2005
    
    Replaced Pyrex-generated version of c8.c with a hand-written version using
    portions of Quixote's _c_htmltext.c.  This seems to make operations roughly
    4 times faster than before.  
    
    The 1.0 c8.py module was written in an unconventional way to accommodate 
    Pyrex.  It was revised in this release to be more direct.
    
    Added stringify() and html_escape_string() utility functions.

Version 1.0: 20 October 2005
    
    First release.
