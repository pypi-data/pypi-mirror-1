Changelog
=========

1.0 - April 19, 2008
--------------------

- The protect decorator had a serious design flaw which broke it. Added
  proper tests for it and fixed the problems.

1.0rc1 - March 28, 2008
-----------------------

- Rename plone.app.protect to plone.protect: there is nothing Plone-specific
  about the functionality in this package and it really should be used outside
  of Plone as well.
  [wichert]

- Made utils.protect work with Zope >= 2.11.

1.0b1 - March 7, 2008
---------------------

- Refactor the code to offer a generic protect decorator for methods
  which takes a list of checkers as options. Add checkers for both the
  authenticator verification and HTTP POST-only.
