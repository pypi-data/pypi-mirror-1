   list is managed for PyUtilib, but otherwise the main Acro mailing lists
   are used to manage the development of this software:

THIRD PARTY SOFTARE
===================

PyUtilib depends on several Python packages.  Python packages that are lightweight, and not likely to be installed are included in the pyutilib/tpl directory.  Testing PyUtilib depends on the 'nose' and 'coverage' packages.

PyUtilib does not rely on any third-party libraries.
