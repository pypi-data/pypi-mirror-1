        PyUtilib is a Python package that includes a wide variety of utilities, including a well-developed plugin framework. PyUtilib has been developed to support several Python projects under development at Sandia National Laboratories, including Acro_, Coopr_ and FAST_.
        
        PyUtilib includes utilities such as:
        
        * A classes to manipulate Excel spreadsheets
        * Utilities for using PLY parsers
        * Utilies for generating cross-products of sets
        * Functions to redirect IO
        * A generic Factory utility
        * Functions for standardizing floating point IO between 32-bit and 64-bit platforms
        * A utility for conveniently importing modules
        * Functions for performing an exact comparison of files
        * Classes for singleton/unity objects
        
        The _PyUtilib plugin framework_ is the most developed element of PyUtilib. This
        framework is derived from the Trac plugin framework, and it
        provides
        
        * Support for both singleton and non-singleton plugin instances
        * Utilities for managing plugins within namespaces
        * A self-contained core that can be independently used from the PyUtilib plugins
        * Commonly use plugins, including
        
        * A config-file reader/writer based on ConfigParser
        * Loading utilities for eggs and modules
        * A file manager for temporary files
