Testing PyUtilib Plugins
========================

This directory is used to test the PyUtilib libraries that relate to the
plugin package.  This package is provided separately from the 'test'
directory because these test muck with the import of pyutilib.  Consequently, they cannot be executed together within 'nose'.

See the pyutilib/test/README.txt for details of how to perform tests.
