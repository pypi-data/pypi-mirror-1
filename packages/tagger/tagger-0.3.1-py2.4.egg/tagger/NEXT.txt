tag verbs/preposition
=====================

* verb: a prefix that dispatches some code on a tag addition and then
  is removed

* preposition: (for:, of:, etc) a prefix that dispatches the addition
  of additional triples on add.

  similar to network tags in delicious(ie for:some_user) in delicious but extensible.
