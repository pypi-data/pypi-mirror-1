"tag:: A stylized signature, normally done in one color. The simplest
    and most prevalent type of graffiti, a tag is often done in a
    color that contrasts sharply with its background. Tag can also be
    used as a verb meaning "to sign". Writers often tag on or beside
    their pieces, following the practice of traditional artists who
    sign their artwork. "

Introduction
============

tagger is a python package for rdflib driven taxonomy/folksonomy tools,
based around the use of annotations to describe "tags".  It utilizes
existing namespaces(FOAF, Annotea) to create a system for managing and
applying tags in building folksonomies.
