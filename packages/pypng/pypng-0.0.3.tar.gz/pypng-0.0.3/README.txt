README for PyPNG
drj@pobox.com

PyPNG provides Python code for encoding/decoding PNG files.  In
particular png.py is a Python module written entirely in Python.


INSTALLATION

PyPNG requires Python version 2.3 (and that's all), or any compatible
higher version.

PyPNG comes with a setup.py script to use with distutils.  After
unpacking the distribution, cd into the directory and execute the
command:

python setup.py install

The png module will be installed; "import png" will allow you to use it
from your Python programs.

Alternatively, you can copy code/png.py wherever you like.  It's intended
that you can copy png.py into your application and distribute it.


GETTING STARTED

"import png" then "help(png)" should be a good place to start.  Also,
lickable HTML documentation appears in the html/ directory.  If HTML is
no good then you could try the ReST sources in the man/ directory.
