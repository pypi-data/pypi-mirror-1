        * added functional test to warehouse [walteralini]
        * Made the viewlet for creating shipments update correctly when adding a
        shipment, this means remove the object from the list [horacio.duran]
        * Fixed bug that prevents the handler from changing the on hand quantity
        since it checks only if the event.destination was not checking among
        shippable workflow states but only among buyable ones [horacio.duran]
        * [svn refactor] moving getpaid.warehouse up one level [lucielejard]
