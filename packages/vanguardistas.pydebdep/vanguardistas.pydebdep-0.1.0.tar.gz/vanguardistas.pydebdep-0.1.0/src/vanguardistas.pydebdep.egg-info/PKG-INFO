Description: PyDebDep
        ========
        
        Tools for introspecting egg dependency information and providing the resulting
        data to Debian packaging tools.
        
        This package provides a script ``pydebdep`` which introspects an installed
        .egg-info to extract egg dependency information. The package names are
        converted to their debian equivilant and the dependency information is printed
        in the format of a dpkg "Depends:" line.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        To extract the dependency info of this package, one can::
        
        $ python2.4 setup.py build
        $ PYTHONPATH=./src python2.4 pydebdep --depends --egg_info src/vanguardistas.pydebdep.egg-info
        python-setuptools, python-vanguardistas
        
        This information is then used in a debian/rules file. Included in this package
        (in the rules directory) are debian/rules files for simple situations. They are
        generic, and work for a lot of packages. But if they don't work for yours, make
        your own.
        
        They can be used in a debian/rules file as follows::
        
        #!/usr/bin/make -f
        
        EGG_NAME=vanguardistas.pydebdep
        PACKAGE=python-vanguardistas.pydebdep
        DEB_SETUPTOOLS=pydebdep
        
        include /usr/lib/python-vanguardistas.pydebdep/rules/rules.1
        
        Future Development
        ------------------
        
        Er, there shouldn't be much, unless someone finds something big.
        
        Mostly what should change is the mapping of setuptools names to debian package
        names as more are added.
