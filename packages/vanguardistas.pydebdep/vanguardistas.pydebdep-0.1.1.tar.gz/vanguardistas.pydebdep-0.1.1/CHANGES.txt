0.1.1 (27-11-2008)
------------------

* Add regression tests for Paste name translation (surprisingly they already pass):
    src/vanguardistas/pydebdep/tests/translations.txt    
* Make sure we don't include .pyc files in packages (changes included debian/rules file).
  Seems to happen with namespace packages at the top level rather than in an src directory.

0.1.0 (13-04-2008)
------------------

* Add a venguardistas.pydebdep.translator.egg_to_deb function that converts egg
  versions to debian versions maintaining their sort order.
* Hook above function into the deb/egg version compare function.
* Produce dependeny lines that contain dpkg-ized version rather than egg versions.

NOTE: The tests of the above changes fail with the setuptools 0.6c3, but pass with 0.6c8.
      This is because of the way that "dev" sorts specially in later setuptools versions.

0.0.3 (10-04-2008)
------------------

* Add ZPL text to all files and source tree.
* Make moving the -nspkg.pth file conditional on one actually existing. Extends the rules.1 file to work with non-namespace eggs.
* Add dependency mappings for PILwoTk, Reportlab and pytz.
* Add mappings from ZODB3 to python-zodb and zodb.
* Guess only lower case names for Debian packages.
* Add README.txt and CHANGES.txt
* Imported into svn.zope.org.
