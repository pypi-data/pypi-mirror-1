Description: zopyx.multieventcalendar
        ------------------------
        
        zopyx.multieventcalendar extends the standard Plone 'Event' type with five
        supplementary date fields. The purpose of this extender is to support events
        with multiple dates associated. E.g. a conference takes place at a particular
        date but often has additional associated dates like for a call-for-papers or a
        registration deadline.  Instead of having multiple unassociated events within
        Plone, you can manage all that with one event instance.
        
        In addition zopyx.multieventcalendar provides a week and month calendar
        supporting this event extender. The implementation also supports
        export/subscription with iCal.

        To do
