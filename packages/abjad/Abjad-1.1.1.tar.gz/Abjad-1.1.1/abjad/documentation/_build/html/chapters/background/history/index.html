<h1>From Trevor and Víctor<a class="headerlink" href="#from-trevor-and-v-ctor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>We are composers <a class="reference external" href="http://www.trevorbaca.com">Trevor Bača</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.victoradan.net">Víctor Adán</a>, creators of Abjad,
and our earliest collaborative work dates back to shared
undergraduate years in Austin.
It was the mid- to late-90s and we found ourselves interested
in ways of building up ever larger sets of musical materials
in our scores, with ever greater amounts of musical information.</p>
<p>Our work then began with pitch formalization, creating materials in C
and then writing the results as MIDI to hear what we&#8217;d created.
Turns out that this is a fairly common gateway into materials
generation for many composers, and so it was for us.
Probably this was, and is, due to the ever present availability
of MIDI and, to a lesser extent, CSound.
But even back then it was clear to us to finding ways to embody
other aspects of the musical score &#8211; from nested rhythms to the
different approaches to the musical measure to the arbitrarily
complex structures possible with overlapping musical voices &#8211;
would require a wholly different level of consideration,
and different development techniques as well.</p>
<p>As an example, consider flat lists of floating-point values.
This basic data structure, together with the constant need some type
of quantification or rounding, feeds much of most composers&#8217; work
with CSound, pd and the like.
It is a good thing, therefore, that essentially all
modern programming languages include tools for manipulating
flat lists of floats out of the box, or in the standard library.
But what happens when you want to think of pitch as something
much more than integers for core values with, perhaps, floats for microtones?
What if you want to work with pitches as fully-fledged objects?
Objects capable of carrying arbitrarily large sets of attributes and values?
Objects that might group together, first into sets, and then
into larger assemblages, and then into still larger complexes of pitch
information loaded, or even overloaded, with cross-relationships or
textural implications?
Carrying this surplus of information about pitch, or the
potential uses of pitch, in data structures limited to, or centered around,
the list-of-floats paradigm then becomes a burden.</p>
<p>And what of working with rhythms not only as offset values, as implied
by the list-of-floats approach, but as arbitrarily nested,
stretched, compressed and stacked sets of values,
as allowed by the tupleting and measure structures of conventional
score?
A different approach is needed.</p>
<p>There was, and still is, no reason to believe that general purpose
programming languages and development tools should come readily supplied
with the objects and methods most suitable for composerly applications.
And this means that the attributes of a domain-specific language
that will best meet the needs of composes interested in working
formally with the full complement of capabilities in traditional
score remains an open question.</p>
<p>We continued our work in score formalization independenly until 2005,
Trevor in a system that would come to be
called Lascaux, and Víctor in a system dubbed Cuepatlahto.
We experimented with C, Mathematica and Matlab as the core
programming languages driving our systems before
settling independently on Python,
Víctor out of experiece at MIT, where he was working on his masters
at the Media Lab with Berry Vercoe, and Trevor out of the working
necessities of a professional developer and engineer.</p>
<p>We passed through indepedent experiences using Finale, Sibelius,
Leland Smith&#8217;s SCORE, and even Adobe Illustrator as the notational
rendering engines for Lascaux and Cuepatlahto.
Through all of this, both systems were designed to tackle
a shared set of problems. These included:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The difficulty involved in transcribing larger scale and highly
parameterized gestures and textures into traditional Western notation.</li>
<li>The general inflexbility of closed, commercial music notation
software packages.</li>
<li>The relative inability of objects on the printed page in conventional
score to point to each other — or, indeed, to other objects or
ideas outside the printed page — in ways rich enough to help capture,
model and develop long-range, nonlocal relationships throughout our scores.</li>
</ol>
<p>Afer collaborating on a joint paper describing the two systems,
and after discussing collaborative design and implementation at length,
both online and in weekends&#8217; long review of our respective codebases,
we decided to combine our efforts into a single, unified project.
That project is now Abjad.</p>
<p>In our work on Abjad we strive to develop a powerful and flexible symbolic
system. We picked the phrase &#8216;formalized score control&#8217;, or FSC,
as a nod to Xenakis, who was so far ahead in so many ways,
and also to highlight our primary project goal:
to bring the full power of modern programming languages, and
tools in mathematics,
text processing, pattern recognition, and modular, iterative and incremental
development to bear on all parts of the compositional process.</p>
