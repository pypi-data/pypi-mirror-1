Description: 
        Rusty is a collection of `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx.pocoo.org>`_
        extensions - namely roles and directives.
        
        At the moment, the Rusty contains following extensions:
        
        **rolelist**
        Generates list from the selected set of role entires,
        written into document. This might come handy for example
        with release notes where bug entries (marked with role syntax)
        are listed automatically.
        
        **includesh**
        Includesh (or include shell) extends the basic functionality of
        ``include`` directive: instead of just including the contents of the
        file into document, the includesh transforms the shell comments into
        documents and commands into literal blocks.
