        Python System Information
        -------------------------
        
        ``psi`` is a Python module providing direct access to real-time system
        and process information.  It is made of of several sub-modules.
        
        The ``arch`` module gives some information about the system such as
        the sytem name and version, the machine architecture etc.  It has a
        class representing each system and a factory function that will return
        an instance of the class which ``psi`` is running on currently.
        
        The ``process`` module provides an interface to information about
        processes currently running on the system.  Each process is
        represented as an instance of the ``Process`` class and additionally
        there is a ``ProcessTable`` class which is a dictionary of all running
        processes.  To know exactly what attributes are available and what
        they mean you should look at the docstrings and examples in the
        ``REAME`` file and ``examples/`` directory, but important to note is
        that all the information is collected at instatiation time.  So the
        contents of ``ProcessTable`` and ``Process`` instances are really
        snapshots and will still contain all information even after the actual
        process has gone.
        
        Lastly there are some general functions available directly under the
        ``psi`` namespace such as ``loadavg()``, ``getzoneid()`` etc.  Once
        more see the docstrings for detailed information.
        
        Some information may not be available on all platforms, rather then
        trying to emulate this information these parts of the API just don't
        exist on those platforms.  Examples of these are:
        ``psi.process.Process.pcpu`` which is not available on Linux,
        ``psi.getzoneid()`` which is only available on SunOS 10 and above etc.
        
        
        Supported Platforms
        ===================
        
        Python: 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 and 3.0.
        
        Linux: kernels from 2.4.0 up to 2.6.29.
        
        SunOS: Solaris 8, 9 & 10 and OpenSolaris (SunOS 11).

        Darwin: 10.3 and above.
        
        
        Documentation
        =============
        
        Care is taken to provide complete and accurate docstrings, so use
        Python's ``pydoc`` tool and the interactive prompt should get you on
        your way.
        
        We also have a wiki (http://www.psychofx.com/psi/trac) and a mailing
        list (http://groups.google.com/group/psi-discuss
        psi-discuss@googlegroups.com).  Don't hesitate to ask questions or
        give feedback.

        Extra setup.py features
        =======================
        
        New ``build_ext`` option: ``--devel``.  This uses ``-Werror`` and
        enables many more warnings as well as disables optimisation.
        
        Using ``--undef PYMALLOC`` or ``-U PYMALLOC`` to ``build_ext`` will
        use libc's memory heap for allocation instead of Python's.
        
        
        The ``test`` command will run the testsuite.  It has a ``--all``
        option that will also run tests that will use ``sudo`` or ``su -c`` to
        run some extra tests as root (these are required if you want to test
        detecting priorities of processes etc).
        
        
        The ``valgrind`` command does run the testsuite under the valgrind
        memory checker.  For this you need to have a specially compiled
        python::
        
        ./configure --with-pydebug --without-pymalloc --prefix=/opt/pydebug
        make
        make install
        
        
        The ``tags`` command will build an emacs TAGS file using ``grind``
        (which is a binary of the python grin_ package).
