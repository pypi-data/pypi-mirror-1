HATE: the High Availability Terminal Emulator.

Gnome Terminal crashes all the *god damned* time.

Xterminal doesn't work properly with 'screen' because it ignores its own 'ASCII
Del' preference setting.

Other terminals look awful on my desktop.

This is a simple replacement terminal that should do everything I need.
