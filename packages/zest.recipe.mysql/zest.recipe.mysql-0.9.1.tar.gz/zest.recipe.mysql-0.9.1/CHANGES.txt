0.9.1 (2008-10-20)
==================

- README update.


0.9 (2008-10-15)
================

- Better conditional downloading/extracting of the zipfiles. [reinout]

- Changing update method to check for existance of /parts/mysql. If you've
  removed that parts directory the full install will be run. Handy for
  updating old installs. [reinout]


0.8 (2008-10-10)
================

- Changed mysql-python egg handling: it no longer installs an egg in your
  global egg cache (which gives errors when you have two buildouts that use
  it). Instead it installs the egg locally as a development egg. This means
  you have to include it in your instance's egg list as ${mysql:eggs}.
  [reinout]

- Added example parts to the buildout config so that it can be tested that
  way. There are no real other tests. [reinout]


0.4.0 (2008-03-16)
==================

 - Created recipe with ZopeSkel [Jean-Paul Ladage].

 - Learned from the varnish recipe and wrote the build recipe which
   downloads, compiles and install MySQL and created wrapper scripts
   in the bin folder of the buildout.
