Recipe to install Mysql
=======================

Code repository: https://svn.zestsoftware.nl/svn/zest/zest.recipe.mysql


It can be a problem getting both mysql and mysql's python binding to install
reliably on everyone's development machine. Problems we encountered were
mostly on the mac, as mysql gets installed into different locations by the
official mysql distribution, macports and fink. And on the mac, the python
binding needs a patch.

One solution: fix the underlying stuff and make mysql and mysql-python a
dependency that has to be handled by the OS. Alternative solution: this
'zest.recipe.mysql' recipe. **Warning: rough edges**. It is not a properly
documented and tested package as it originally was a quick
need-to-get-something-working-now job.

Here's a quick piece of buildout to get you started if you want to test
it::

 [buildout]
 parts =
     mysql
     ...

 [mysql]
 recipe = zest.recipe.mysql
 mysql-url = http://downloads.mysql.com/archives/mysql-5.0/mysql-5.0.51a.tar.gz
 mysql-python-url = http://switch.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/mysql-python/MySQL-python-1.2.2.tar.gz

 [plone]
 ...
 eggs =
     ...
     ${mysql:eggs}

* This ought to download and install mysql and mysql-python.

* Mysql and mysql-python end up in '.../parts/mysql'.

* mysql-python is installed as a development egg by buildout.

* The socket and the database are in '.../var/mysql'.
