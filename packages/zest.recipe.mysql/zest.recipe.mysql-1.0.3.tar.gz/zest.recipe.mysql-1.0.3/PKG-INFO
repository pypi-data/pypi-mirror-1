Description: Recipe to install Mysql
        =======================
        
        Code repository:
        http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/buildout/zest.recipe.mysql
        
        
        It can be a problem getting both mysql and mysql's python binding to install
        reliably on everyone's development machine. Problems we encountered were
        mostly on the mac, as mysql gets installed into different locations by the
        official mysql distribution, macports and fink. And on the mac, the python
        binding needs a patch.
        
        One solution: fix the underlying stuff and make mysql and mysql-python a
        dependency that has to be handled by the OS. Alternative solution: this
        'zest.recipe.mysql' recipe. **Warning: rough edges**. It is not a properly
        documented and tested package as it originally was a quick
        need-to-get-something-working-now job.
        
        Here's a quick piece of buildout to get you started if you want to test
        it::
        
        [buildout]
        parts =
        mysql
        ...
        
        [mysql]
        recipe = zest.recipe.mysql
        mysql-url = http://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/MySQL-5.0/mysql-5.0.86.tar.gz/from/http://mysql.proserve.nl/
        mysql-python-url = http://surfnet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/mysql-python/MySQL-python-1.2.2.tar.gz
        
        [plone]
        ...
        eggs =
        ...
        ${mysql:eggs}
        
        * This ought to download and install mysql and mysql-python.
        
        * Mysql and mysql-python end up in '.../parts/mysql'.
        
        * mysql-python is installed as a development egg by buildout.
        
        * The socket and the database are in '.../var/mysql'.
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        
        1.0.3 (2009-10-19)
        ------------------
        
        - Add a recipe option, ``config-skeleton``:  if passed, points to a file
        used as a template for generating an instance-local ``my.cnf`` file.
        Ensure that the generated wrapper scripts use this file, if generated;
        if not, ensure that the wrappers disable "standard" config file lookups.
        
        - Document existing recipe options in class docstring.
        
        - Delegate command line arguments from wrapper script to the real mysqld_safe,
        just as with other wrappers.
        
        
        1.0.2 (2009-10-14)
        ------------------
        
        - Unchanged rerelease of 1.0.1 due to fix packaging error.
        [maurits]
        
        
        1.0.1 (2009-10-13)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix support for newer MySQL releases, thanks to a patch send in by
        Tres Seaver. [jladage]
        
        
        1.0 (2009-10-09)
        ----------------
        
        - Nothing changed yet.
        
        1.0beta (2008-10-21)
        --------------------
        
        - Added bin/stop-mysql script. [reinout]
        
        
        0.9.1 (2008-10-20)
        ------------------
        
        - README update.
        
        
        0.9 (2008-10-15)
        ----------------
        
        - Better conditional downloading/extracting of the zipfiles. [reinout]
        
        - Changing update method to check for existance of /parts/mysql. If you've
        removed that parts directory the full install will be run. Handy for
        updating old installs. [reinout]
        
        
        0.8 (2008-10-10)
        ----------------
        
        - Changed mysql-python egg handling: it no longer installs an egg in your
        global egg cache (which gives errors when you have two buildouts that use
        it). Instead it installs the egg locally as a development egg. This means
        you have to include it in your instance's egg list as ${mysql:eggs}.
        [reinout]
        
        - Added example parts to the buildout config so that it can be tested that
        way. There are no real other tests. [reinout]
        
        
        0.4.0 (2008-03-16)
        ------------------
        
        - Created recipe with ZopeSkel [Jean-Paul Ladage].
        
        - Learned from the varnish recipe and wrote the build recipe which
        downloads, compiles and install MySQL and created wrapper scripts
        in the bin folder of the buildout.
