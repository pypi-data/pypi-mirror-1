Changelog
=========


1.0.3 (2009-10-19)
------------------

- Add a recipe option, ``config-skeleton``:  if passed, points to a file
  used as a template for generating an instance-local ``my.cnf`` file.
  Ensure that the generated wrapper scripts use this file, if generated;
  if not, ensure that the wrappers disable "standard" config file lookups.

- Document existing recipe options in class docstring.

- Delegate command line arguments from wrapper script to the real mysqld_safe,
  just as with other wrappers.


1.0.2 (2009-10-14)
------------------

- Unchanged rerelease of 1.0.1 due to fix packaging error.
  [maurits]


1.0.1 (2009-10-13)
------------------
  
- Fix support for newer MySQL releases, thanks to a patch send in by
  Tres Seaver. [jladage]


1.0 (2009-10-09)
----------------

- Nothing changed yet.

1.0beta (2008-10-21)
--------------------

- Added bin/stop-mysql script. [reinout]


0.9.1 (2008-10-20)
------------------

- README update.


0.9 (2008-10-15)
----------------

- Better conditional downloading/extracting of the zipfiles. [reinout]

- Changing update method to check for existance of /parts/mysql. If you've
  removed that parts directory the full install will be run. Handy for
  updating old installs. [reinout]


0.8 (2008-10-10)
----------------

- Changed mysql-python egg handling: it no longer installs an egg in your
  global egg cache (which gives errors when you have two buildouts that use
  it). Instead it installs the egg locally as a development egg. This means
  you have to include it in your instance's egg list as ${mysql:eggs}.
  [reinout]

- Added example parts to the buildout config so that it can be tested that
  way. There are no real other tests. [reinout]


0.4.0 (2008-03-16)
------------------

 - Created recipe with ZopeSkel [Jean-Paul Ladage].

 - Learned from the varnish recipe and wrote the build recipe which
   downloads, compiles and install MySQL and created wrapper scripts
   in the bin folder of the buildout.
