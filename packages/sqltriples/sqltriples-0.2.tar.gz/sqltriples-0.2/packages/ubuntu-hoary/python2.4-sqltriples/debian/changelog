sqltriples (0.2-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Changed the querying mechanisms to use the SQL "exists"
    keyword with subqueries/subselects, rather than testing
    for the presence of result tuples in subqueries.
  * Moved the test code into a separate program.
  * Added support for pysqlite2, introducing adapters for
    database systems.
  * Added support for filtering functions, exposed only in
    the objects method, currently.
  * Changed the open function to require either a database
    name and a module name or an adapter object, created
    using the provided adapter classes. Where a
    configuration is not supported, NotSupportedError
    exceptions are raised.
