sqltriples (0.3.1-0ubuntu0) hoary; urgency=low

  * Fixed handling of empty list values in patterns: these
    should inhibit result production.

sqltriples (0.3-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Made sqltriples a proper Python package.
  * Made significant changes to query construction,
    introducing additional features (eg. tuples) and store
    methods (such as those for conjunction, disjunction and
    negation). Added partial retrieval (where queries
    involving n-tuples may return shorter tuples) and
    subject ordering support.
  * Added various node classes as attributes to the store,
    along with other conveniences.
  * Added index creation in the database for potential
    performance improvements.

sqltriples (0.2.1-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Changed the Namespace class to inherit from URIRef.
  * Introduced helper classes for expressions, along with
    classes to describe conjunctions, disjunctions, unions
    and intersections.
  * Fixed subquery membership in cases where functions are
    applied to object values.
  * Added a pattern parameter to the subjects and predicates
    methods in order to expose more advanced querying.
  * Added support for testing against lists of predicates.
  * Added support for negated queries, the presence of
    values in triples (and other results), and for
    particular object types in expressions.

sqltriples (0.2-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Changed the querying mechanisms to use the SQL "exists"
    keyword with subqueries/subselects, rather than testing
    for the presence of result tuples in subqueries.
  * Moved the test code into a separate program.
  * Added support for pysqlite2, introducing adapters for
    database systems.
  * Added support for filtering functions, exposed only in
    the objects method, currently.
  * Changed the open function to require either a database
    name and a module name or an adapter object, created
    using the provided adapter classes. Where a
    configuration is not supported, NotSupportedError
    exceptions are raised.
