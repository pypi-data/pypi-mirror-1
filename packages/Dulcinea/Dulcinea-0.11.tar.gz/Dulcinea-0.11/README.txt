Dulcinea
========

Dulcinea is a collection of modules useful for developing applications
with Quixote and the Durus.


Documentation
=============

No detailed documentation has been written yet.  The Toboso
distribution is intended to serve as an example of an application
using Dulcinea, so that might also be useful to look at.


Requirements
============

Dulcinea is developed using Python 2.4.  

You'll need to install Sancho, our unit test framework
(http://www.mems-exchange.org/software/sancho/), to run the test
suites.

The bin/opendb script assumes that Python was compiled with the
readline module.  If Michael Hudson's pyrepl
(http://pyrepl.codespeak.net/) is installed, it will be used to
provide command-editing features.

Installation
============

To install Dulcinea, simply run:

    python setup.py install

The dulcinea package and its subpackages will be copied into the
appropriate directory for site-specific packages.
