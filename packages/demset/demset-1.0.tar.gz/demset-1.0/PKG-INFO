Description: This module provides an implementation of the 'set' and 'frozenset' types which
        were introduced in Python 2.4, but which work under older versions (Python 2.2
        or 2.3).  It is a standalone module written entirely in Python, and can easily
        be used as a substitute for the built-in types when runing under older Pythons.
        Care was taken to try to provide nearly 100% compatibility with Python 2.4's
        behavior.
