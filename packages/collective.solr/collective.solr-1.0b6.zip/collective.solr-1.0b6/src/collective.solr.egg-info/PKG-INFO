Description: 
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        `collective.solr`_ is an approach to integrate the `Solr`_ search engine with
        `Plone`_.  It provides an indexing processor for use with
        `collective.indexing`_ as well as a search API similar to the standard portal
        catalog.  `GenericSetup`_ profiles can be applied to set up content indexing
        in `Solr`_ and use it as a backend for `Plone`_'s site and live search
        facilities.

        Current Status
        --------------
        
        The implementation is considered to be nearly finished. The package can be
        installed in a `Plone`_ 3.x site to enable indexing operations as well as
        searching (site and live search) using `Solr`_. Doing so will not only
        significantly improve search performance |---| especially for a large number
        of indexed objects, but also reduce the memory footprint of your `Plone`_
        instance by allowing to remove the ``SearchableText`` index from the portal
        catalog |---| at least for most sites. A sample buildout_ is provided for your
        convenience.

        The code was written with emphasis on minimalism, clarity and maintainability.
        It comes with extensive tests covering the code base. The package is currently
        in use in production and considered stable.
        
        .. at more than 95%.  XXX: make coverage run pick up all modules!
        
        For outstanding issues and features remaining to be implemented please see the
        `to-do list`__ included in the package as well as it's `issue tracker`__.

        FAQs / Troubleshooting
        ----------------------
        
        **"AssertionError: cannot use multiple direct indexers; please enable queueing"**
        
        Symptom
        When installing additional packages or applying a GenericSetup profile
        you're getting the following error::
        
        AssertionError: cannot use multiple direct indexers; please enable queueing
        Problem
        Early versions of the package used a persistent local utility, which is
        still present in your ZODB.  This utility has meanwhile been replaced so
        that there are currently two instances present.  However, without queued
        indexing being enabled, only one such indexer is allowed at a time.
        Solution
        Please simply re-install the package via Plone's control panel or the
        quick-installer.  Alternatively you can also use the ZMI "Components" tab
        on your site root object, typically located at
        http://localhost:8080/plone/manage_components, to remove the broken
        utilities from the XML.  Search for "broken".

        This code was inspired by `enfold.solr`_ by `Enfold Systems`_ as well as `work
        done at the snowsprint'08`__.  The `solr.py` module is based on the original
        python integration package from `Solr`_ itself.
