Description: 
        NonMockObjects
        ==============
        
        NonMockObjects aims to make it easy to create complicated structures
        representing more realistic test data, thus allowing you to write
        tests against your *real* code, not mock objects. This allows you to
        write high-level integration tests almost as easily as small-scale
        unit tests, once you build up your library of creation functions.
        
        **How to tell if you need this module**: You want to run automated
        tests on your code, but you have a relatively complicated data model,
        perhaps a nicely normalized database. The bulk of your tests consist
        of setting up this relatively complicated data model, and the tests
        all break whenever you change your model. Constructing the data has
        become so difficult (and breaks so often) that you've just stopped
        testing entirely.
        
        (Note that as this is a pure-Python module, the "source" distribution
        is all there is.)
