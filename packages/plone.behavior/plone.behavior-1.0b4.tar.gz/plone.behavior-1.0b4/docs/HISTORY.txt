1.0b4 - 2009-06-07
------------------

* Allow a marker-interface-only behavior to be set by using the 'provides'
  attribute (previously 'interface') in the <plone:behavior /> directive
  without a 'factory' attribute. The 'marker' attribute (previously known as
  'subtype') is now only required if there is a marker used in addition to
  a behavior adapter with a separate interface ('provides') and factory.

* Rename the 'interface' attribute of <plone:behavior /> to 'provides' to
  be more consistent with the <adapter /> directive. This is a backwards
  incompatible change!
  [optilude]

* Rename the 'subtype' attribute of <plone:behavior /> to 'marker' to
  be more explicit about its purpose. This is a backwards
  incompatible change!
