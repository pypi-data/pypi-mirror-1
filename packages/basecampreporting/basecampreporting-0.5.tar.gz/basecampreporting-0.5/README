## basecampreporting  
Python read-only interface to Basecamp projects, with support for Scrum concepts like sprints and backlogs.  

It's being developed for use in the django-baseboard project: http://github.com/cmheisel/django-baseboard/tree/master

Future plans include adding write capability and refactoring the Scrum-y stuff into seperate classes.
