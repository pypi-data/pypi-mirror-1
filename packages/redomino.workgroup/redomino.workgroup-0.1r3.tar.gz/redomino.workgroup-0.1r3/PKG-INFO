Description: ==================
        redomino.workgroup
        ==================
        
        redomino.workgroup is a product for Plone. It will install automatically all his dependencies.
        
        redomino.workgroup is based on membrane/remember and you'll be able to create easily workgroup sections and restricted
        areas with local Members and with local search capabilities.
        redomino.workgroup doesn't introduce new folderish content types (you can enable or disable each existing plone folders).
        
        redomino.workgroup may be used also with redomino.autodelete, so we'll be able to create a folder with local member types that will be
        deleted automatically once expired.
