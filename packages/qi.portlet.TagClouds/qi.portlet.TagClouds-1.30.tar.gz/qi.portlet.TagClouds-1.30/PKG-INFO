Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        qi.portlet.TagClouds is a plone product that adds tag cloud portlet support. The following parameters of the portlet are configurable through the web:
        
        * portlet title
        * number of different tag sizes
        * maximum tags to show
        * content types searched (optionally)
        * tags (subjects) searched (optionally)
        * section of the site to be searched
        * workflow states searched
        * filtering by keywords so that a tag cloud of all keywords that are combined
        with the filter keywords is shown
        
        qi.portlet.TagClouds also comes with a simple caching mechanism. Cache takes
        into account the user, the portlet parameters and remains valid for a time
        interval that can be set in the portlet settings.

        =========
        
        1.30
        ----
        * The product is now accompanied with proper tests. [ggozad]
        * Added filtering by keyword. Thanks to lzdych for the idea and
        discussions. [ggozad]
        * All important parameters (workflow states, portal types and search path)
        are now present in the search links. [ggozad]
        * Moved vocabularies. [ggozad]
        * Removed the settings shouldRestrictBySubject and shouldRestrictByTypes.
        Now just using sane defaults. [ggozad]
        * Modified the caching mechanism, so that it takes into account the portlet
        settings. This ensures separate caching for separate portlets. [ggozad]
        * Added the member in the portlet cache key. This will increase the
        calculations necessary, but is important as it was possible to cache private
        objects as well. [ggozad]
        * Added the number of items found under the tag in the *title* of the links.
