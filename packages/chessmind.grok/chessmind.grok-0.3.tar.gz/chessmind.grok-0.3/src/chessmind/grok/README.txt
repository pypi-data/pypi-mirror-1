Me Grok play chess!
===================


Introduction
------------

This is a Grok project.  Grok makes it easier to get started with a
Zope 3 web application.  In this case I am building a chess
application.  I thought it would be nice to be able to play this in a
web browser.  That at least saves me some trouble in coming up with a
user interface.


ChessMind
---------

The chess program itself is in the chessmind.core package.  It should
not depend on Grok at all.  You can go to that package and run the
tests by executing ./__init__.py.  If that does not return any text,
all tests pass.  Me Grok good programmer!
