Images
------

The chess pieces have been taken from http://www.openclipart.org/
Specifically, when installing the Ubuntu Debian openclipart package,
/usr/share/openclipart/png/recreation/games/chess/ contains
chess_set_symbols_igor_k_01.png which I split into individual 40x40
png files.  Those images are in the public domain.  Thanks, Igor K.!
