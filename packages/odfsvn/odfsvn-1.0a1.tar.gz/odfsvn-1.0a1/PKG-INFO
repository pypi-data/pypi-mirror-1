        Introduction
        ============
        
        ODFSVN is a set of tools that allow you to manage ODF_ documents in
        a subversion_ repository. There are several reasons that make this a
        very useful thing to do:
        
        * it allows you to use all features of a version control system: all
        changes are archived along with change notes, making it possible
        to roll back to previous versions, see who made what changes and why,
        etc.
        
        * it makes it possible to have multiple people sharing their changes
        to a document through a shared repository. That means that you
        can always see all changes from all editors, update your version
        to the latest revision and submit your changes. No matter where you
        are, with or without access to your email, you will always be
        able to share your work.
        
        For now this can be done through the ``odfsvn`` command line tool. In the
        (near) future this will also be possible through a plugin for
        `OpenOffice.org`_.

        Quick example
        =============
        
        Suppose you are working on a proposal with a group of people. The proposal
        is stored in a file called ``proposal.odt`` which you have just created.
        The first thing that you need to do is import this file into an existing
        repository::
        
        $ odfsvn import -m "Simplon proposal for odf RFP" proposal.odt \
        http://code.simplon.biz/proposals/odf.odt
        Commited revision 22
        
        This will have added your file to the repository. The ``-m`` parameter
        was used to set the commit message for this change.
        
        You can now use the *info* command to check the repository information
        inside your file::
        
        $ odfsvn info proposal.odt
        Path: proposal.odt
        Type: svn
        URL: http://code.simplon.biz/proposals/odf.odt
        Repository UUID: 1a87ecf8-a9bc-47a4-9dc9-5f45153203cc
        Revision: 22
        
        If one of your co-editors wants to work on this proposal he must first
        retrieve the document using the *checkout* command::
        
        $ odfsvn checkout http://code.simplon.biz/proposals/odf.odt
        Checked out revision 22
        
        He can now edit the ``odf.odt`` file using his normal editors. After
        making any changes he can commit them using the *commit* command::
        
        $ odfsvn commit -m "Added estimates and initial planning" odf.odt
        Changes committed.
        
        You can now update your local copy using the *update* command::
        
        $ odfsvn update proposal.dt
        Updated to revision 23
        
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        odfsvn requires the subversion_ command line tool ``svn``, python_
        and setuptools_ to be installed.
        
        After installing those requirements you can install odfsvn using the
        ``easy_install`` command::
        
        easy_install odfsvn
        
        This will install the odfsvn command and the associated python package. If
        you are using a UNIX shell you may need to refresh the command cache from your
        shell after doing this (``hash -r`` or ``rehash`` generally).
