        Compatibility
        -------------
        
        Plone 3.1

        About
        -----
        
        Collage is a product for aggregating and displaying multiple content items on
        a single page.
        
        It provides the following content-types:
        
        * Collage
        * Row
        * Column
        * Alias
        
        The first three are structural containers that provide basic layouting
        functionality. The premise is that a column fits inside a row which again
        fits inside a collage.
        
        The Alias-type is provided to allow displaying existing objects from the site
        inside the collage.
        
        Upgrading
        ---------
        
        Open in ZMI .../your-site/portal_setup and click the "Upgrades" tab.
        Select the "Products.Collage:default" profile and see if upgrades are
        available. Run them :D
        
        Javascript functionality
        ------------------------
        
        We use the jquery-library to facilitate easy scripting. Ajax is used to move
        content items, columns and rows around without reloading the page.
        
        Status
        ------
        
        Used in production.
        
        Support for add-on packages
        ---------------------------
        
        These should be added to the collective.collage package:
        
        * https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/collective.collage
        
        under ./browser/addons/<package name>
        
        Make sure collective.collage is in your python path if you want these views
        registered for use in Collage.

        Collage developer documentation
        ===============================
        
        The Collage product was built to be easily customizable.
        
        Content views
        -------------
        
        New content views can be added by registering a browser view with
        a browser:page-directive. Examples of this can be found in::
        
        ./browser/views.zcml
        
        A view for a standard document can be registered as follows::
        
        <browser:page
        name="my-view"
        for="Products.ATContentTypes.content.document.ATDocument"
        permission="zope.Public"
        template="my-view-template.pt"
        class=".document.MyDocumentView"
        layer="Products.Collage.interfaces.ICollageBrowserLayer"
        />
        
        To display a human-readable title, we associate the view with the
        following class, placed in a file document.py:::
        
        from Products.Five.browser import BrowserView
        
        class MyDocumentView(BrowserView):
        title = u'My view'
        
        
        Skins views
        -----------
        
        New skins views can be added by registering a named utility in::
        
        MySkin/browser/skins.zcml
        
        For example, a skin "Alert" for the view "my-view" can be registered
        as follows::
        
        <utility
        name="collage-my-view-alert"
        provides="Products.Collage.interfaces.IAlertSkin"
        factory=".skins.PortletSkin03"
        />
        
        To display a human-readable title, we associate the utility with the
        following class, placed in a skins.py::
        
        from Products.MySkin import MyMessageFactory as _
        
        class PortletSkin03(object):
        title = _(u"skin-03", default=u"My portlet skin")
        
        Add IAlertSkin in MySkin/interfaces.py::
        
        from zope import interface
        class IAlertSkin(interface.Interface):
        """Interface for alert skins views."""
        
        To associate this skin to a view, you must add the interfaces
        implemented by the skin::
        
        class MyDocumentView(BrowserView):
        title = u'My view'
        skinInterfaces = (IAlertSkin,)
        
        Note that you don't need this above stuff for portlets views
        that are already skinnable.
        
        Finally, add your CSS rules in a stylesheet::
        
        #collage .collage-my-view-alert {
        ...
        
        }
        
        Note that if you are using "Merge CSS composition" of CSS registry,
        your stylesheet must be after "collage.css" and use the same condition
        as the former::
        
        object/@@collage|nothing
        
        
        Content controls
        ----------------
        
        Content controls are registered as viewlets. See
        ./browser/viewlets.zcml for examples.

        this.
        [glenfant]
        
        * Using the MessageFactory for labels and descriptions in
        schemas. Code is more compact and i18ndude friendly.
        [glenfant]

        [glenfant]
        
        
        Collage 1.2.0 beta 2
        --------------------

        * Added a GenericSetup upgrade step to 1.2.0.
        [glenfant]

        Collage 1.2.0 beta 1
        --------------------
        
        https://svn.plone.org/collective/Collage/tags/1.2.0beta1
        
        * Added a skin demo for portlets
        [glenfant]
        
        * Code cleanup with pyflakes
        [glenfant]
        
        * Registering skin with ZCML
        [glenfant]
        
        * Version is now 3 digits (major.minor.bugfix) as most components.
        [glenfant]
        
        * Extensions/* (Install script) is now useless. Removed
        [glenfant]
        
        * Removed meta_type attr in GS profile when not creating
        objects. (potentially harmful according to MArtin Aspeli)
        [glenfant]
        
        * Defining "view" variables in templates is harmful. Renamed to
        kssview (generally)
        [glenfant]
        
        * For  reason I can't understand, templates macros for KSS editing
        only work when in a <span metal:define-macro ...> or a <div
        metal:define-macro ...>
        [glenfant]
        
        * We must set each fied in its own macro in the xx_portlet.pt views
        otherwise KSS screams.
        [glenfant]
        
        * Made portlets skinnable (reintroduced some of the zegor branch)
        [glenfant]
        
        * Fixed unicode error in clipboard's title (reintroduced fix from
        zegor branch).
        [glenfant]
        
        * I hate tabs for indenting (removed in every file I needed to change)
        [glenfant]
        
        * Some easy code refactorings: the trunk does not support Plone 2.x
        and older versions any more.
        [glenfant]
        
        * Added some markups for i18ndude in Python.
        [glenfant]
        
        * Moved (and added) tests to "tests" directory.
        [glenfant]
        
        * Making templates ready for i18ndude that found malformed stuffs when
        ZPT is more tolerant.
        [glenfant]
        
        * Made split- and expand-icons transparent
        [malthe]
        
        * Added clickable link view.
        
        * Simplified view class names.
        [malthe]
        
        * Removed annotations hack (we now expect content to be IAnnotatable).
        [malthe]
        
        * Image standard display now shows the actual image rather than its
        preview.  This caused issues with large images in a Collage being
        upscaled when displayed.  [rockdj]
