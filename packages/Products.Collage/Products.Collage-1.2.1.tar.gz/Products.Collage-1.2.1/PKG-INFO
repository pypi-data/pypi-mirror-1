        =======
        
        Compatibility
        -------------
        
        * Plone 3.1
        * Five 1.5
        
        About
        -----
        
        Collage is a product for aggregating and displaying multiple content items on a
        single page.
        
        It provides the following content-types:
        
        * Collage
        * Row
        * Column
        * Alias
        
        The first three are structural containers that provide basic layouting
        functionality. The premise is that a column fits inside a row which again fits
        inside a collage.
        
        The Alias-type is provided to allow displaying existing objects from the site
        inside the collage.
        
        Upgrading
        ---------
        
        If you upgraded Products.Collage in the file system, open in ZMI
        /your/plone/site/portal_setup and click the "Upgrades" tab.
        
        Select the "Products.Collage:default" profile and see if upgrades are
        available. Run them :D
        
        Javascript functionality
        ------------------------
        
        We use the jquery-library to facilitate easy scripting. Ajax is used to move
        content items, columns and rows around without reloading the page.
        
        Status
        ------
        
        Used in production.
        
        Support for add-on packages
        ---------------------------
        
        These should be added to the collective.collage package:
        
        * https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/collective.collage
        
        under ./browser/addons/<package name>
        
        Make sure collective.collage is in your python path if you want these views
        registered for use in Collage.
        
        See DEVELOPER.txt to add support for custom content types and themings.

        Collage developer documentation
        ===============================
        
        The Collage product was built to be easily customizable.
        
        Content views
        -------------
        
        New content views can be added by registering a browser view with a
        browser:page-directive. Examples of this can be found in::
        
        ./browser/views.zcml
        
        A view for a standard document can be registered as follows::
        
        <browser:page
        name="my-view"
        for="Products.ATContentTypes.content.document.ATDocument"
        permission="zope.Public"
        template="my-view-template.pt"
        class=".document.MyDocumentView"
        layer="Products.Collage.interfaces.ICollageBrowserLayer"
        />
        
        To display a human-readable title, we associate the view with the following
        class, placed in a file document.py:::
        
        from Products.Five.browser import BrowserView
        
        class MyDocumentView(BrowserView):
        title = u'My view'
        
        
        Skins views
        -----------
        
        New skins views can be added by registering a named utility in::
        
        MySkin/browser/skins.zcml
        
        For example, a skin "Alert" for the view "my-view" can be registered as
        follows::
        
        <utility
        name="collage-my-view-alert"
        provides="Products.Collage.interfaces.IAlertSkin"
        factory=".skins.PortletSkin03"
        />
        
        To display a human-readable title, we associate the utility with the following
        class, placed in a skins.py::
        
        from Products.MySkin import MyMessageFactory as _
        
        class PortletSkin03(object):
        title = _(u"skin-03", default=u"My portlet skin")
        
        Add IAlertSkin in MySkin/interfaces.py::
        
        from zope import interface
        class IAlertSkin(interface.Interface):
        """Interface for alert skins views."""
        
        To associate this skin to a view, you must add the interfaces implemented by the
        skin::
        
        class MyDocumentView(BrowserView):
        title = u'My view'
        skinInterfaces = (IAlertSkin,)
        
        Note that you don't need this above stuff for portlets views that are already
        skinnable.
        
        Finally, add your CSS rules in a stylesheet::
        
        #collage .collage-my-view-alert {
        ...
        
        }
        
        Note that if you are using "Merge CSS composition" of CSS registry, your
        stylesheet must be after "collage.css" and use the same condition as the
        former::
        
        object/@@collage|nothing
        
        Products.Collage provides a minimal skinning demo. See the ``skindemo`` folder
        (start with ``skindemo/README.txt`` as usual).
        
        
        Content controls
        ----------------
        
        Content controls are registered as viewlets. See ./browser/viewlets.zcml for
        examples.
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        Collage 1.2.0 trunk (unreleased)
        --------------------------------
        
        https://svn.plone.org/collective/Products.Collage/trunk/
        
        * Moved event handlers in events.py module
        [glenfant]
        
        * Fixed bug on searching (spaces in type name or non ascii searchable
        text). Found items titles are colored according their workflow state as in
        folder_contents (...)
        [glenfant]
        
        * Use `folder_summary_view` instead of `folder_listing` in topic
        views. This fixes issue #43.
        [malthe]
        
        * Added Alias target search limit in config panel.
        [glenfant]
        
        * Optimizations of existing items view including link to target.
        [glenfant]
        
        * Removed code for old Plone (< 3.1) support since we can't be used in
        Plone 3.0 or older anymore
        [glenfant]
        
        * Memoizing where possible to speed up views (not sure to be exhaustive)
        [glenfant]
        
        * New translations due to the control panel, and added translations synch
        script.
        [glenfant]
        
        * Fixed bug on @@collage_helper
        [glenfant]
        
        * Added control panel for Collage inner content types whitelist.
        [glenfant]
        
        * Collage is now LinguaPlone compatible and therefore Collage elements
        are now translatable.
        [erral]
        
        * Renderer: if a layout is defined on a canonical object, but not
        on a translation, now the canonical version's layout setting
        is used for the translation rather than the default. (Language
        versions should look the same unless explicitly defined otherwise.)
        [thomasw]
        
        * Added Basque (eu) and Spanish (es) translations.
        [erral]
        
        * Added safety belt to GenericSetup upgrade scripts.
        [glenfant]
        
        * Added translation entries for new boolean in Collage.
        [glenfant]
        
        * Collage subcontents indexing is now an option, since a Collage
        object may be irrelevant in search results (i.e: a Collage with
        only File contents).
        [glenfant]
        
        * Added utilities.getFSVersionTuple that may help Collage extension
        components (add skins, content type support, ...)
        [glenfant]
        
        * version.txt is major.minor.bugfix-[beta] to get synch with
        metadata.xml/version (when upgrade step required) and complying
        getFSVersionTuple above
        [glenfant]
        
        * Add missing event-related translation.
        [kdeldycke]
        
        Collage 1.2.0 beta 3 (2008-08-15)
        ---------------------------------
        
        https://svn.plone.org/collective/Products.Collage/tags/1.2b3
        
        * Packaged as a python egg and released on pypi.
        [davisagli]
        
        * Renamed builtin portlet skins and gave minimum CSS to them.
        [glenfant]
        
        * Re-using ATContentTypes.content.schemata.ATContentTypesSchema and
        removing copied/pasted portions of code in our schema definitions.
        [glenfant]
        
        * Removed CMF skins layer "Collage" and spreaded its stuffs in Zope 3
        style browser resources and pages (CSS). Added an upgrade step for
        this.
        [glenfant]
        
        * Using the MessageFactory for labels and descriptions in
        schemas. Code is more compact and i18ndude friendly.
        [glenfant]
        
        * Added unit tests for utilities.
        [glenfant]
        
        
        Collage 1.2.0 beta 2
        --------------------
        
        https://svn.plone.org/collective/Collage/tags/1.2.0beta2
        
        * Added a GenericSetup upgrade step to 1.2.0.
        [glenfant]
        
        * Removed useless Folder and Plone Site types setups.
        [glenfant]
        
        Collage 1.2.0 beta 1
        --------------------
        
        https://svn.plone.org/collective/Collage/tags/1.2.0beta1
        
        * Added a skin demo for portlets
        [glenfant]
        
        * Code cleanup with pyflakes
        [glenfant]
        
        * Registering skin with ZCML
        [glenfant]
        
        * Version is now 3 digits (major.minor.bugfix) as most components.
        [glenfant]
        
        * Extensions/* (Install script) is now useless. Removed
        [glenfant]
        
        * Removed meta_type attr in GS profile when not creating
        objects. (potentially harmful according to MArtin Aspeli)
        [glenfant]
        
        * Defining "view" variables in templates is harmful. Renamed to
        kssview (generally)
        [glenfant]
        
        * For  reason I can't understand, templates macros for KSS editing
        only work when in a <span metal:define-macro ...> or a <div
        metal:define-macro ...>
        [glenfant]
        
        * We must set each fied in its own macro in the xx_portlet.pt views
        otherwise KSS screams.
        [glenfant]
        
        * Made portlets skinnable (reintroduced some of the zegor branch)
        [glenfant]
        
        * Fixed unicode error in clipboard's title (reintroduced fix from
        zegor branch).
        [glenfant]
        
        * I hate tabs for indenting (removed in every file I needed to change)
        [glenfant]
        
        * Some easy code refactorings: the trunk does not support Plone 2.x
        and older versions any more.
        [glenfant]
        
        * Added some markups for i18ndude in Python.
        [glenfant]
        
        * Moved (and added) tests to "tests" directory.
        [glenfant]
        
        * Making templates ready for i18ndude that found malformed stuffs when
        ZPT is more tolerant.
        [glenfant]
        
        * Made split- and expand-icons transparent
        [malthe]
        
        * Added clickable link view.
        
        * Simplified view class names.
        [malthe]
        
        * Removed annotations hack (we now expect content to be IAnnotatable).
        [malthe]
        
        * Image standard display now shows the actual image rather than its
        preview.  This caused issues with large images in a Collage being
        upscaled when displayed.
