Pyreb is a wxPython GUI to the re python module; it will speed up the 
development of Python regular expression (similar to PCRE).
The GUI is simple and features 3 parts:
1) A text box where the text to be analyzed is displayed
2) A text box where the regular expression to be applied is displayed
3) A tree control where the results are displayed

When one of the two textboxes change the regex is compiled and applied. Errors
in the regex are shown in a statusbar.

Pyreb ships with a simple XMLRPC server that can be used to control pyreb
from an external application. It must be started using the 
Tools/Start XMLRPC Server
menu item. The XMLRPC server understands 4 methods:
Pyreb.setText(Txt)
Pyreb.getText()
Pyreb.setRegex(Txt)
Pyreb.getRegex()
The first two get/set the text in the uppermost section, the last two get/set
the regex in the medium section. Once the text/regex is set the match is 
recalculated and shown, as it would happen in interactive usage.
A sample session:
>>> import xmlrpclib
>>> a = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy("http://localhost:17787")
>>> a.system.listMethods()
['Pyreb.getRegex', 'Pyreb.getText', 'Pyreb.setRegex', 'Pyreb.setText', 'system.listMethods', 'system.methodHelp', 'system.methodSignature']
>>> a.Pyreb.setText("abc")
'setText'
>>> a.Pyreb.getText()
'abc'
>>> a.Pyreb.setRegex('a?(bc){1,}')
'setRegex'
These commands set the text 'abc' in the "Text to analyze" edit box, the regex
in the "Regex to apply" edit box and recomputes the match, shown in the
lower "Results" tree.

Pyreb is somewhat similar to Activestate RX Toolkit (part of Komodo IDE), but
is a completely different project.
