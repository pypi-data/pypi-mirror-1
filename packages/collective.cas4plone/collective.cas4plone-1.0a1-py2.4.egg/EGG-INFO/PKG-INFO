Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        collective.cas4plone is an implementation of the CAS single-sign-on for
        the Pluggable Authentication Service. It is a fork of the Products.CAS4PAS
        product. This fork became necessary, because we were not able to reach the
        package maintainer of Product.CAS4PAS for quite some time.
