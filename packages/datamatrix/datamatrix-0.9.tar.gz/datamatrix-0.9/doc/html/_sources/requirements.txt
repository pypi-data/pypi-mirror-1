Requirements and installation
#############################

DataMatrix requires Python, at least version 2.5. Python 2.6 is also known to work. Python 3.0 compatibility has not been tested. It makes no use ofi third-party modules so it should work on a standard Python install. Being a pure Python module, it will work reliably on Windows, Linux, BSD and OS X.

The latest version can be downloaded from

http://www.dennogumi.org/projects/datamatrix

both as a source distribution and a Windows installer. Windows users just need to run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. Other operating
system users should download the source distribution, unpack it (``tar xvzf filename``) and then install it by issuing::

	python setup.py install

as root.
