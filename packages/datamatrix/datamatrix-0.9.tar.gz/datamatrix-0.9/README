2. Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DataMatrix is a Python module that tries to emulate the behavior of the 
"data.frame" data structure of the R programming language. Data.frames are 
essentially tables that can be queried either by row or columns, or, in the 
presence of a header, even by column names. 

DataMatrix emulates this behavior by reading a text file (or file-like object) 
into a dictionary which in turn contains lists (the columns of the table).
For each row in the original text file, the columns contain a two item tuple, 
whose first item is the "row name" and the second the actual value for that 
row and column. 

Row names are a way to identify a row precisely (R uses it because some of its
operations return the names of the rows rather than their values) and are either
read from a specific column or a progressive numeric value otherwise.

DataMatrix objects can be queried with a dictionary-like syntax (e.g., 
matrix["column name"]), or by other methods.

Detailed documentation is available in the HTML and PDF manuals, which can be 
found in PREFIX/share/doc/datamatrix (Linux) or C:\Python\Data\datamatrix
 (Windows).
