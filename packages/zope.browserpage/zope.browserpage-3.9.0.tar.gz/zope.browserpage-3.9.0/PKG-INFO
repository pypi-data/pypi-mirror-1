Description: ========
        Overview
        ========
        
        *This package is at present not reusable without depending on a large
        chunk of the Zope Toolkit and its assumptions. It is maintained by the*
        `Zope Toolkit project <http://docs.zope.org/zopetoolkit/>`_.
        
        This package provides ZCML directives for configuring browser views.
        More specifically it defines the following ZCML directives:
        
        * browser:page
        * browser:pages
        * browser:view
        
        These directives also support menu item registration for pages, when
        ``zope.browsermenu`` package is installed. Otherwise, they simply ignore
        the menu attribute.
