Changelog for dataflake.ldapconnection
======================================

0.4 (2008-12-25)
----------------

- fakeldap bug: the modify_s method would expect changes of type MOD_DELETE
  to come with a list of specific attribute values to delete. Now the 
  attribute will be deleted as a whole if the expected list is None, this
  reflects actual python-ldap behavior better.

- now we are exercising the fakeldap doctests from within this package,
  they used to be run from Products.LDAPUserFolder, which was not cleaned
  up when the fakeldap module moved to dataflake.ldapconnection.

0.3 (2008-08-30)
----------------

- fakeldap: no longer override the LDAP exceptions, just get them from
  python-ldap.

----------------

- backport a fix applied to the LDAPUserFolder FakeLDAP module to handle
  BASE-scoped searches on a DN.


0.1 (2008-06-11)
----------------

- Initial release.
