|mathbench| is entirely written in Python_ and as such works on
 several platforms namely Linux, MacOSX and Windows.

There are several ways to install it, and we will mainly describe here
the most generic way to do it (ie the one that works whatever the
platfoms). We also provide some information about an easier way to
install it on MacOSX_.



Generic installation: the EasyInstall_ way
------------------------------------------


Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  1. Install Python_ (2.4 or later)

  2. Install setuptools_

  3. Install wxPython_ (2.8 or later)


MathBench installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  1. Download the .egg file of `MathBench from PyPI`_
  
  2. Run ``easy_install`` on it

  3. Relax, it's done !

.. hint:: 
   ``easy_install`` should be available on a Terminal in Linux or
   MacOSX. On windows you might have to look for it in your Python
   installation's Scripts directory (e.g. c:\Python25\Scripts)


Running it
~~~~~~~~~~

On Linux and MacOSX, you can type ``MathBench`` in a Terminal and the
application will be launched. Alternatively you can then create
shortcuts or desktop entries to make it easier.

On Windows, an executable script is installed in your Python
installation's Scripts directory (see `this explorer screenshot`_). Double click
on it to launch MathBench. Alternatively you can create a shortcut to
this script from anywhere on your desktop.
