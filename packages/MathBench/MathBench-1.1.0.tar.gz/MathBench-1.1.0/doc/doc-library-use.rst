A memory lapse ? Ask for help on the library desk !
---------------------------------------------------

|mathbench| tries to spare you hours of searching through internet
looking for basic documentation (like small code samples) by
providing you a pertinent information through its library desk.


The library desk is as easy to use as the easiest of all search
engines:

  - type a query in the library desk entry (at the bottom of the window)

  - browse the search results to find the info you need

  - ask an unlimited number of question on the library desk
