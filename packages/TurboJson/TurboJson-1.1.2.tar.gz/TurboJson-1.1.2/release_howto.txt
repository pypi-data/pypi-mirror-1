1) Make sure all tests pass and setup.py contains the desired
    version number.

2) create the eggs with the desired python version using the following
    command line. This command will ignore the version numbers and svn
    tagging put in the setup.cfg file:
    python setup.py egg_info -RDb "" sdist bdist_egg

3) upload the eggs to the cheeseshop:
    python setup.py egg_info -RDb "" sdist bdist_egg register upload

4) Announce at the ML, etc, etc...
