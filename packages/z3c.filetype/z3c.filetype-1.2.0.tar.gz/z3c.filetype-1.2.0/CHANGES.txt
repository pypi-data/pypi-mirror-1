=====

2009/01/19 1.2.0
================

 - added interfaces for Microsoft office files
   Note : with the current magic.mimes file it is not possible to reliably
          detect Microsoft Office files. All Office files are detected as
          application/msword. The only way for now is to use the filename to
          detect the type. (see README.txt)

2007/12/21 1.1.1
================

 - added an interface for BMP image files
 - make sure unknown formats are not recognized as a default format

 - Because tests failed and the author of the changes did not fixed them after
   a year I reverted trunk to version 82160.

2007/12/06 1.1.0
================

 - new mimetype interface IAudioMPEGType
 - mimetype extension for audio/mpeg layer 3
 - removed setup.cfg
 - added CHANGES.txt
