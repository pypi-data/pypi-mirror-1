Description: Nodes is yet another Pythonic AI library with NN-similar concept.
        Calculations are splitted into "nodes" - small objects with programmers-defined
        actions. Nodes are connected into digraph-like network. Every Node has as much
        input and output arcs as you want (actually, as its shape declares, but it is
        user-defined too). For information, see README.
        Editor, Twisted-matrix integration and full documentation may be available
        in future versions.
        It is highly recommended to use Python Syncronized Compiler (python-psyco)
        to accelerate speed.
