Description: 
        GinGin is a hybrid of WIKI and BLOG.  Users of GinGin can setup tags for
        their documents.  The documents will be hyper-linked, automatically, when
        tags are in the content of them.  In another word, GinGin will create
        cross-reference for documents by the tags specified by users.
        
        GinGin also has capability to tag URLs.  URLs are associated with tags
        and cross-referenced for documents.
