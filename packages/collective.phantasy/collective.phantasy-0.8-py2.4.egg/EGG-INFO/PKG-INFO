        Change the skin of your plone site, change the skin of any content on the site based on ATFolder, through a simple form.
        
        Just Upload images with the same name in the skin using a tgz or a zip,
        to overload standard plone skin images referenced in css.

        SVN UNRELEASED
        --------------
        
        0.8
        ---
        
        * fix permission for phantasy viewlet
        zope.Public is more appropriate : avoid Unauthorized exceptions in some cases
        
        * fix version to 0.8
        
        * synchronize setup.py version with metadata.xml
        
        * fix doctests when using IPython
        
        * fix Manifest.in to avoid errors with docs folder in zip package
        
        0.7
        ---
        
        * avoid acquisition problems for css images when skin is created in portal_factory,
        in this case css_url = portal_url
        
        * fix css content type when uploading a tgz or zip file
        
        0.6
        ---
        
        * Manifest.in was missing at root : fix big problem with "python setup.py sdist"
        when using collective.releaser 0.6.1, only ".py" files were released
        
        * Fix ATContentTypes AutoOrderSupport import error with last ATContentTypes version
        
        * check_id script overload in PhantasySkinImage content type because we want to
        be able to overload portal_skins images when using the classical Plone edit forms
        
        0.5
        ---
        
        * Fix stupid syntax error in folderskinview.py
        Catalog reequest was broken
        
        * Fix strange plone behavior :
        portal_properties.site_properties.getProperty('myproperty')
        returns '\n' + property value + '\n'
        when myproperty is a string
        Perhaps we must do someting else ?
        
        * Tests were broken : a memoize decorator was missing in viewlet
        
        0.4
        ---
        
        * added a safe_hasattr to test 'getCssfile' attribute
        in viewlet.py (avoid errors in rare situations)
        
        * changes 'portal_type' catalog request for 'object_provides' to get
        portal dynmaic skin
        
        * phantasy css view uses a dtml file more readable than zpt
        
        * phantsy css view uses ResourceRegistries CSSPacker tool
        
        * fix error in atphantasy schema : plone-overloads fields were invisible
        
        * move plone-overloads fields at bottom in atphantasy schema
        
        * patch form_tabbing.js to get standard behavior in edit form when tabs > 6
        
        0.3
        ---
        
        * fix an error in path search term for catalog search
        
        * fix running doctests when config is patched by another product.
        
        
        0.2
        ---
        
        * added all dependencies in setup.py since SmartColorWidget is now an egg.
        
        * added plone products dependencies in metadata.xml profile
        
        * removed import-steps.xml, importSteps handler added in profile.zcml
        
        0.1
        ---
        
        * Initial release
        
        TODO
        ====
        
        
        * overrides logo viewlet to get Logo image from skin
        without using css background property (i don't like it but
        it's the new Plone behavior for Logo)
        
        * At this time all standard skin images are overloaded though css when
        these images are present in skin, excepted for portal_type icons,
        since generated.css is no more used in Plone.
        So we must patch getIcon method to get thes icons from phantasy skin
        if these icon exists.
