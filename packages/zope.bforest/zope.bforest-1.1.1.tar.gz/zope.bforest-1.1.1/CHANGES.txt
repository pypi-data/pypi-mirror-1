1.1.1 (2008-04-09)
------------------

Bugfix:

- periodic variant was pseudo-guaranteeing maximum period, not minimum
  period, contradicting documentation.  Changed implementation and test to
  match documentation (i.e., guarantees minimum period; maximum period is
  a bit fuzzy, as described in docs).

1.1 (2008-03-08)
----------------

Features: 

- added periodic variant

- added L-variants
