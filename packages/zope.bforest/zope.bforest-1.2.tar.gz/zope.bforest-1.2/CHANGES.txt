1.2 (2008-05-09)
----------------

Bugfixes:

- added omitted __ne__ implementation.

Features:

- added minKey, maxKey, like BTrees.

- gave itervalues, iteritems, and iterkeys same extra arguments as BTrees'
  values, items, and keys: min, max, excludemin, excludemax.

- changed implementation of iter[...] functions to try to only wake up buckets
  as needed.

Incompatible Changes:

- changed definition of __eq__: now compares contents *and* order.  Tries to
  only wake up buckets as needed.

1.1.1 (2008-04-09)
------------------

Bugfix:

- periodic variant was pseudo-guaranteeing maximum period, not minimum
  period, contradicting documentation.  Changed implementation and test to
  match documentation (i.e., guarantees minimum period; maximum period is
  a bit fuzzy, as described in docs).
