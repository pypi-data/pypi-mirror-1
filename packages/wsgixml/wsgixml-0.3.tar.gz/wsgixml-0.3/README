This package contains some WSGI components of particular interest to
those using XML in their Web applications in some way.  The components
included in this release are:

applyxslt - WSGI middleware for applying XSLT to an XML response body
            if needed (i.e. if the response is XML with a stylesheet PI
            and the browser is not known to support XSLT)

safexhtml - Middleware that checks for XHTML capability in the client
            and translates XHTML to HTML if the client can't handle it

Installation
------------

WSGI.xml requires Python 2.4 or more recent and 4Suite-XML 1.0.2 or more
recent.  The easiest way to install it is:

easy_install wsgixml

If this does not work you are probably not set up for easy_install and I
suggest you follow the simple instructions at

http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall

easy_install will automatically take care of installing dependencies for
you.  If you prefer not to use easy_install, then grab a 4Suite-XML 1.0.2
or more recent, and install that.  Then install WSGI.xml with the usual:

python setup.py install
