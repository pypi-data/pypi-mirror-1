1.0b1 - 2009-05-30
------------------

* Make z3c.blobfile (and blobs in general) a soft dependency. You'll need to
  separately depend on z3c.blobfile (and probably pin it to versio 0.1.2) to
  get the NamedBlobFile and NamedBlobImage fields. This means that
  plone.namedfile can be used with ZODB versions that do not support BLOBs.
  This policy will probably be revisited for a 2.0 release.
