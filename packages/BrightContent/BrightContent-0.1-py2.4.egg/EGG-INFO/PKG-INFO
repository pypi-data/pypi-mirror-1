Description: `Bright Content<http://brightcontent.net>`_ is Python Weblog software built from
        reusable components.
        It offers many of the usual features of Weblog engines, but it's basic
        opration and plug-in model is based on the WSGI standard for Python Web
        components.  Many existing WSGI components can be plugged sirectly into
        Bright Content in order to enhance its operation, and Bright Content
        also has a set of specialized components for common Weblog needs.
        
        Bright Content also builds on the `Atom Syntax, Atom
        Protocol<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_%28standard%29>`_, and
        an XML data flow.  XML is used modestly (e.g. not for configuration)
        and is intended as much as possible not to get in the way.  Built-in
        templates are XSLT for now, but using `Buffet
        plug-ins<http://projects.dowski.com/projects/buffet>`_ other
        templating systems can be easily added.
        
        The latest version is available in a `Subversion repository
        <http://svn.brightcontent.net/brightcontent/trunk#egg=brightcontent-dev>`_.
