Thanks for downloading django-shapes.

To install it, run the following command inside this directory::

    $ python setup.py install

If you have the Python ``easy_install`` utility available, you can
also type the following to download and install in one step::

    $ easy_install django-shapes

Or if you'd prefer you can simply place the included ``shapes``
directory somewhere on your Python path, or symlink to it from
somewhere on your Python path.
