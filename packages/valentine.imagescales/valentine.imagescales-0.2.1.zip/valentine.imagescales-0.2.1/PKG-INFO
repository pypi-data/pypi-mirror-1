Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Imagescales is a generic system for creating thumbnails/image representations
        for content types, both those provided by Plone, and custom ones. To make it
        work for a content type, three adapters need to be provided:
        
        1. ImageView that retrieves an image in the desired scale.
        2. ImageTag that returns the HTML tag for the image
        3. ImageLink that returns the HTML link to the image.
