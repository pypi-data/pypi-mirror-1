Features:

- Compatibility with Zope 3.2
- Command-line option to specify a htpasswd file name for protection
- Show persistent object attributes when hovering on a link
- Figure out if it's possible to show a list of transactions
- Help page in a javascripty-popup (lightbox-style)

Refactorings:

- Replace global getHistory/loadState with an IHistory adapter
- Standalone app: see if you can replace the zope publisher with something
  lightweight (WSGI?) so that you can inspect databases when their structure
  is broken (no site/unpickleable site objects)
- Unify URL generation logic in browser.py and object.py (maybe merge the
  two files since they're very closely related)

Tests:

- Complete test coverage
    - test ZEO ClientStorage integration (that ugly inspection hack)
    - tests for browser views
    - tests for javascript
- Buildbots for various python and zope versions
- make distcheck (python sdist; untar and run python sdist; compare the two)
