Description: Still a work in progress.
        This is a javascript library I've been developing to allow in place editions
        of arbitrary DOM objects. It doesn't do any AJAX by itself but allows
        the attachment of hooks that can do it.
        For the input fields it uses a javascript widget system that will allow
        complex ones to develop. Right now there are available the text field and
        single selector widgets.
        Uses Prototype right now, but I might do it "library" agnostic.
        Works with Opera and Firefox, fails with IE (I don't know when I'll fix it, it's
        far from being a priority on the project I'm currently working).
        Check the widget browser!
