# Release information about InPlace

version = "0.1a0"

description = "Wrapper for the InPlace javascript library"

long_description = """Still a work in progress.
This is a javascript library I've been developing to allow in place editions
of arbitrary DOM objects. It doesn't do any AJAX by itself but allows 
the attachment of hooks that can do it.
For the input fields it uses a javascript widget system that will allow
complex ones to develop. Right now there are available the text field and 
single selector widgets.
Uses Prototype right now, but I might do it "library" agnostic.
Works with Opera and Firefox, fails with IE (I don't know when I'll fix it, it's
far from being a priority on the project I'm currently working).
Check the widget browser!"""
