Pythius is a set of tools to assess the quality of Python code. This is
commonly done by applying different code metrics. Simple code metrics
are the ratio between comments and code lines, module and function size,
etc. The immediate goal of the project is to start implementing the
simple metrics, and discover more complex code metrics or adapt them
from other languages. 

The project's name has two origins: 

 1. In Greek mythology, Python was a serpent that dwelt in the caves of
    Mount Parnassus and was slain by Apollo. After that, Apollo bore the
    epithet of Pythius. The aim of this project is to contribute to the
    death of bad Python code, by recognizing said code. 

 2. The second origin is the Greek architect Pythius, who was said to have
    built The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, one of The Seven Wonders of the
    Ancient World, about 353 B.C. He also built the Temple of Athena Polias
    in the ancient city Priene. The temple was recognized in ancient times
    as the classic example of the pure Ionic style. Similarly, we want to
    enable developers to build pure Pythonic code that resembles the
    beautiful style of Greek architecture.

The project's homepage can be found at http://pythius.sourceforge.net/.
