# QUICK GUIDE #
###############

For the impatient, here are the minimal steps to install Pythius:

  * Get Python 2.2.1 or higher if you do not already have it. Pythius won't
    run with older versions.

  * Unpack the distribution archive (when you are reading this, you have
    probably already done that)

  * Run "python setup.py build"

  * Run "python setup.py install"

Done.
