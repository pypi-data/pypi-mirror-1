django-template-repl is a readline shell for the Django template language.
It is similar to a cpython shell but it interprets template code instead of
python. It can be invoked either as a management comment or within another
template for debugging.

To install, add 'template_repl' to your settings.INSTALLED_APPS.

The management command gives you quick access to the shell:
    python manage.py templateshell

Or, add this to your template and it will create a REPL that assumes the
context of the caller template. This is sort of like "PDB for templates":
    {% load repl %}{% repl %}
