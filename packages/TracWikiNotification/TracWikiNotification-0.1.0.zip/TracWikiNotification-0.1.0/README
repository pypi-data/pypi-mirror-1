==============================
 Trac Wiki Notification Plugin
==============================

Trac WikiNotification_ is a plugin that allows users(even anonymous,
as long as email is set) to select the wiki pages that they wish to
be notified(by email) when a change occurs on it.

**Note**: The user updating the wiki page won't be notified about his own
changes.

You can find more info on the trac WikiNotification_ site where bugs and new
feature requests should go to.

Enabling the Plugin
-------------------
It's as simple as::

   [components]
   wikinotification.* = enabled

And optionally::

   ctxtnavadd.* = enabled

Available Configuration Options
-------------------------------
These are the options available to include on your ``trac.ini`` under
``wiki-notification``.

=====================  ====================  ================================
 **Config Setting**     **Default Value**     **Explanation**
---------------------  --------------------  --------------------------------
*redirect_time*        5 (in seconds)        The default seconds a redirect
                                             should take when
                                             watching/un-watching a wiki page.
                                             This value is also definable per
                                             user, ie, user is able to
                                             configure this, of course for
                                             himself.
---------------------  --------------------  --------------------------------
*smtp_always_bcc*      *empty*               Email address(es) to always send
                                             notifications to, addresses do
                                             not appear publicly (Bcc:).
---------------------  --------------------  --------------------------------
*smtp_always_cc*       *empty*               Email address(es) to always send
                                             notifications to, addresses can
                                             be seen by all recipients (Cc:).
---------------------  --------------------  --------------------------------
*smtp_from*            trac.wiki\@localhost  Sender address to use in
                                             notification emails.
---------------------  --------------------  --------------------------------
*use_public_cc*        False                 Recipients can see email
                                             addresses of other CC'ed
                                             recipients. If this option is
                                             disabled(the default), recipients
                                             are put on BCC.
=====================  ====================  ================================

If you want to override these settings then you can include it like the
following example::

   [wiki-notification]
   redirect_time = 5
   smtp_always_bcc =
   smtp_always_cc =
   smtp_from = trac.wiki@localhost
   use_public_cc = false

Download and Installation
-------------------------

Trac WikiNotification can be installed with `Easy Install`_ by typing::

    > easy_install TracWikiNotification


Trac 0.11 support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As of time of this writing (Jan 5 2008), 0.11 support available only in trunk
version (svn). Which is natural, since Trac 0.11 is still in beta as well.
You won't need ``ctxnavadd`` no more.

To install this development version type::

   > easy_install http://wikinotification.ufsoft.org/svn/trunk

Aditional Notes(from user input)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``easy_install`` is run from the command line (on Linux) not from within
  Python.


* After installing any plugin for Trac you'll need to restart Apache to see
  it (not all changes to trac.ini require a restart but adding a plugin does).


* Make sure to add the new plugin to ``trac.ini`` ::

    [components]
    wikinotification.* = enabled    


* Also should be noted that the ``trac.ini`` configuration for the wiki
  notification should look something like::

    [wiki-notification]
    smtp_always_cc = someone@somedomain
    smtp_from = trac.wiki@localhost


* **Another note**: a user will never get a notice of his/her own wiki
  modification (which is a little tricky when testing the plugin :))
