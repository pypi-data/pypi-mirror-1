                <h2><a href="/docs/writing_a_state_storage.html">Writing A Lamson State Storage Backend</a></h2>

<p>	<p>Earlier versions of Lamson assumed that you would use SQLAlchemy, and
that you wouldn&#8217;t mind storing your state in the database using
SQLAlchemy.  Well, during the 0.9 redesign it became very easy to let
you store the state however and wherever you want.  In the new Lamson setup
there is a bit more work to create alternative storage, but Lamson comes with
two default stores that you can use to get started.</p></p>

<h2><a href="/docs/primary_vs_secondary_registration.html">Primary vs. Secondary Registration</a></h2>

<p>	<p>When you design a Lamson application the question of &#8220;registration&#8221;
comes up almost immediately.  The question is one of how you find out
who a person is so that you can interact with them.  In the web world
this involves a form of some kind asking for a login and password at a
minimum.  Some sites even go so far as to require a sign-up process
<strong>before</strong> they let you see anything about the site, or even their marketing
material.</p></p>

<h2><a href="/docs/lamson_virtual_env.html">Installing Lamson Into Virtualenv With Pip</a></h2>

<p>	<p>The best way to install Lamson in a virtualenv is using the 
<a href="http://pip.openplans.org/">pip tool</a> to install it. This will automatically fetch the 
code from bazaar, install it inside the virtualenv and fetch any 
missing dependencies.</p></p>

<h2><a href="/docs/lamson_commands.html">Available Lamson Commands</a></h2>

<p><p>The following is also available by running <b>lamson help</b> and you can get the
help for each individual command with <b>lamson help -for COMMAND</b> replacing
COMMAND with one of these listed below.</p></p>

<h2><a href="/docs/introduction_to_finite_state_machines.html">A Painless Introduction To Finite State Machines</a></h2>

<p>	<p>Lamson uses the concept of a Finite State Machine to do the internal
processing and keep track of what it should do next.  You don&#8217;t
necessarily need to know the details of how a <span class="caps">FSM</span> works, but it
helps you if you want to know enough about Lamson to do advanced work.
Most people could be blissfully unaware of state machines and still do 
plenty of work with Lamson.</p></p>

<h2><a href="/docs/getting_started.html">Getting Started With Lamson</a></h2>

<p>	<p>Lamson is designed to work like modern web application frameworks like Django, TurboGears,
<span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span>, Ruby on Rails, and whatever <span class="caps">PHP</span> is using these days.  At every design decision 
Lamson tries to emulate terminology and features found in these frameworks.  This Getting Started
document will help you get through that terminology, get you started running your first
lamson application, and walk you through the code you should read.</p></p>

<h2><a href="/docs/filtering_spam.html">Filtering Spam With Lamson</a></h2>

<p>	<p>Lamson supports initial use of the <a href="http://spambayes.sourceforge.net/">SpamBayes</a> spam filter
library for filtering spam.  What Lamson provides is a set of easy to use decorators that you
attach to your state functions which indicate that you want spam filtered.  It also uses the
default SpamBayes configuration files and database formats as you configure, so if you have
an existing SpamBayes setup you should be able to use it right away.</p></p>

<h2><a href="/docs/deploying_lamson.html">Deploying Lamson And OneShotBlog</a></h2>

<p>	<p>These instructions will teach you how to setup a completely clean Python 2.6 installation,
a virtualenv with lamson, and all the gear needed to run the <a href="http://oneshotblog.com/">oneshotblog.com</a>
software on your machine.  It then leads you through the nitty-gritty details of getting 
oneshotblog.com running on your machine and testing it.</p></p>

<h2><a href="/docs/deferred_processing_to_queues.html">Deferred Processing To Queues</a></h2>

<p>	<p>As of the 0.9.2 release there is preliminary support for deferring
handling of a mail message to a queue for another process to deal with
in a separate handler.  This support is rough at this time, but still
useful and not too difficult to configure.  As the feature gets more
use it will improve and hopefully turn into a generic &#8220;defer to queue&#8221;
system in Lamson.</p></p>
