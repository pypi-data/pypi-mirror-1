<p>	<p>I <strong>finally</strong> got off my ass and put the <a href="http://oneshotblog.com/">OneShotBlog</a> sample up.
This is the code (plus a few little tweaks) from the sample that is in the <a href="/releases/">Lamson source</a>
running on another server.  It&#8217;s using all the features of Lamson, include the new <a href="/docs/deferred_processing_to_queues.html">Queue Receiver</a>
functionality.  So far it&#8217;s working great considering I&#8217;ve just been hacking on it on the side to try
out the usability of the Lamson <a href="/docs/api/">APIs</a> and not really taken it seriously.</p>

	<p>The concept of the oneshotblog is a little weird:</p></p>

<h2><a href="/blog/2009-06-03.html">2009-06-03</a> : Lamson 0.9.1 Out, New Docs</h2>

<p>	<p>I released Lamson 0.9.1 today so please <a href="/download.html">grab it and test it</a> and shoot me feedback.</p>

	<p>The little changes are easier handling of attachments in MailRequest, a
small tweak to spam_filter, and then a bunch of test enhancements and extra
gear.  The big change is a redesign to lamson.args so that it infers the
command line arguments from the lamson.commands function keyword arguments.
It&#8217;s mostly an internal change since others can&#8217;t write their own commands
(yet).</p></p>

<h2><a href="/blog/2009-06-03-2.html">2009-06-03-2</a> : Lamson 0.9.2, Test Coverage 97%</h2>

<p>	<p>The 0.9.2 release is out and ready for everyone to easy_install.  I spent the
day getting rid of my tech debt by boosting the Lamson test coverage to a
whopping 97%.</p>

	<p>I also wrote new documentation on <a href="http://lamsonproject.org/docs/deferred_processing_to_queues.html">Running A Queue Receiver</a> in a separate process using Lamson.</p></p>

<h2><a href="/blog/2009-06-01.html">2009-06-01</a> : Lamson 0.9 Is Out, Find My Bugs!</h2>

<p>
I just pushed Lamson 0.9 up to PyPI for everyone to grab and break.  This release 
features a complete redesign of the routing, state handling, templating, and a full 
set of very complete documentation.  Everyone who was using 0.8.x series should be able 
to migrate to this version with some work, but it won&#8217;t be terribly painful (assuming
you have unit tests).

<h2><a href="/blog/2009-05-31.html">2009-05-31</a> : Lamson 0.9 Later Today</h2>

<p>	<p>I have been working hard on the documentation and scrubbing the code for Lamson and the 0.9 release
coming out soon.  The only things I feel I need to do before an official 0.9 release are:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Clean up the one-shot-blog demo application a bit more.</li>
		<li>Write a small set of instructions on writing your own <a href="http://lamsonproject.org/docs/api/lamson.routing.StateStorage-class.html">StateStorage.</a></li>
		<li>Do a last final code review to check for any obvious problems.</li>

<h2><a href="/blog/2009-05-28.html">2009-05-28</a> : 0.9-pre2 Up For Testing, Docs Too</h2>

<p>	<p>First off, my apologies to everyone if your <span class="caps">RSS</span> reader went crazy today.
I include documentation changes in the <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed so that people can
easily track updates to the Lamson docs.  However, that means when I&#8217;m
writing a lot of documentation it hits the feed repeatedly.</p>

	<p>The good news though is that you can now get at the 0.9-pre2 release of
Lamson from the <a href="/releases/">releases</a> page and you can read the great
new documentation I&#8217;ve got.</p></p>

<h2><a href="/blog/2009-05-24.html">2009-05-24</a> : Features For The 0.9 Release (Soon)</h2>

<p>
<p>I've been hard at work cooking up the very nice new routing system, and
I must say it is rather tasty.  I've gone and created a whole new
routing and state management design that uses decorators right in your
handler modules to indicate how each state will expect mail addresses.
</p>

<p>
For the 0.9 release happening tomorrow I've got a new Router setup,
spam filtering baked in nice and clean, improved test coverage, and 
indirect state storage for those who don't like SQLAlchemy.

<h2><a href="/blog/2009-05-19.html">2009-05-19</a> : New Site Look, Same Great Content</h2>

<p>	<p>This is just a quick update to say thanks to <a href="http://kenkeiter.com/">Ken Keiter</a>
for creating a new <a href="http://lamsonproject.org/">lamsonproject.org</a> site layout and
design.  The new site should be easier to read, have more breathing room, and look
easier on the eyes.  It&#8217;s even got a logo:</p>

<h2><a href="/blog/2009-05-18.html">2009-05-18</a> : Bug Fix 0.8.4, Mailing Lists, Spam Blocking</h2>

<p>	<p>A few announcements from my work on Lamson the last few days.  I managed to fix
a bug, put Lamson to work doing Lamson&#8217;s mailing lists, and use Lamson to do
some spam blocking on my own email account.</p>

	<p>Hopefully eating my own dogfood won&#8217;t be too painful.</p></p>

<h2><a href="/blog/2009-05-16.html">2009-05-16</a> : Lamson Project Site Launched</h2>

<p>	<p>Today I launched the Lamson Project site at
<a href="http://lamsonproject.org/">lamsonproject.org</a> and started filling in the
content.  Lamson is really turning into a fun and useful project, and hopefully
the site will get other people interested in it and using it.</p>

	<p>I took the design from one of the many free web design sites and reused the same Python blog script that I use on <a href="http://zedshaw.com/">my own site</a> so getting this up and running was cake.</p></p>
