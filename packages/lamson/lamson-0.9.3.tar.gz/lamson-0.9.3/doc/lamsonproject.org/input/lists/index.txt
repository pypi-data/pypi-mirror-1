Title: Lamson Project Mailing Lists

The Lamson mailing list is available at:

"lamson.users-subscribe@lists.lamsonproject.org":mailto:lamson.users-subscribe@lists.lamsonproject.org

The software running that mailing list is written in Lamson, and as of May 2009
is only beta level if that.  It'll be improved as more and more people use
it and I work out the kinks in it.

The mailing list software running at lists.lamsonproject.org is
an open mailing list system.  This means anyone is free to create a
mailing list by simply sending a subscribe message to it.  If it's not
available, then Lamson will create it for you.  You're free to use
it for now, but if this feature is abused then I'll turn it off.

There are currently no archives of the lamson.users mailing list,
and no list of available mailing lists on lists.lamsonproject.org.
I'll have those features written shortly.
