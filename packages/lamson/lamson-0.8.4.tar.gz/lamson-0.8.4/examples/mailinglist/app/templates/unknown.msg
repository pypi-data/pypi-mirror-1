You sent an email to ${address} but it's not formatted right.

Unlike other mailing list servers, this one uses a '.' in the 
list's name and a '-' to separate the commands.  That means
if you sent your email to:

  lamson-users@lists.zedshaw.com

Then that'll fail.  You need to use:

  lamson.users@lists.zedshaw.com

And then it will work.

Thanks!
