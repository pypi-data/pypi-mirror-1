Title: Lamson Releases

You can get the Lamson source in various ways:

* Download it from "the Launchpad project page":https://launchpad.net/lamson/+download
* Use "Bazaar":http://bazaar-vcs.org/ to get the code with *bzr branch lp:lamson*

If neither of those work for you, then you can get a probably out of date release 
from here:

"0.8.3 release":/releases/lamson-0.8.3.tar.gz

This release is only updated when there are major releases to distribute.
