Title: Getting Help With Lamson

Until there are "mailing lists":/lists/ available (running Lamson of course) the best way 
to get help with Lamson is to email me directly.  You can send mail to:

<pre>
zedshaw at zedshaw dot com
</pre>

If you send an email and I don't respond, simply send it again.  It sometimes takes me
a few days to respond, but I always do.
