Title: Lamson Releases

You can get the Lamson source in various ways:

* Download it from "the Launchpad project page":https://launchpad.net/lamson/+download
* Use "Bazaar":http://bazaar-vcs.org/ to get the code with *bzr branch lp:lamson*

And don't forget you can install it with easy_install as well:

<pre class="code>
sudo easy_install lamson
</pre>


h2. Releases

You can get the 0.9 release source from the this site as well:

"0.9 release tar.gz":/releases/lamson-0.9.tar.gz

This version has been tested, but it is a fairly big change from the 0.8.x series.  You should be able
to migrate your code to 0.9 quickly, but you'll want to read through the documentation, and I hope you had
tests for everything.


h2. Examples

You can get the One-Shot-Blog example by grabbing the above source, untarring it, and then look in example/osb.
