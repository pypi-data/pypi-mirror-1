<p>	<p>Since the 0.9.4 release I&#8217;ve rewritten the main part of the decoding parser 
so that it&#8217;s much cleaner and handles more edge conditions.  If there&#8217;s one 
word that defines what makes <span class="caps">MIME</span> horrible it would be &#8220;edge&#8221;.</p>

	<p>It&#8217;s amazing the kind of stupid crap clients are allowed to send out in headers.
I&#8217;ve actually got test cases from Mutt where it breaks headers up into completely
different encodings across multiple lines for no damn reason at all.  Here&#8217;s a 
test I had to write just to cover the one worst case I found:</p></p>

<h2><a href="/blog/2009-06-20.html">2009-06-20</a> : Lamson 0.9.4 With Unicode Super Powers</h2>

<p>	<p>Lamson 0.9.4 is out and it&#8217;s sporting a completely rewritten and meticulously 
crafted encoding system.  With the new <a href="http://lamsonproject.org/docs/api/lamson.encoding-module.html">lamson.encoding</a> code Lamson can now decode nearly any nasty horrible encoded spam
or mail you hand it, turn it into pristine nice Python unicode strings, and
then output sweet clean ascii or utf-8 in a consistent way.</p>

	<p>The purpose of this new encoding system is to make sure that Lamson
is giving your handlers the best input it can, based on the assumption
that the world is evil and Lamson will be handed utter garbage.</p></p>

<h2><a href="/blog/2009-06-14.html">2009-06-14</a> : The Mailocalypse Is Upon Us!</h2>

<p>	<p>I&#8217;m currently polishing off the two final features before I start going for
the Lamson 1.0 release.  I&#8217;ve been using Lamson to make a few little cute applications
and create one thing for a potential client, and so far I haven&#8217;t had to change much
since 0.9.3.  It&#8217;s great so far and I hope that Lamson 1.0 will be a fun release.</p>

	<p>The <strong>big</strong> thing that must improve though is handling character encodings in emails.
After spending a week or more trying to come up with an automated conversion scheme that 
would honor all the encodings on the planet, I had a realization.</p></p>

<p>	<p>Just a quick reminder that I&#8217;ll be presenting <a href="http://lamsonproject.org/">Lamson</a> to the 
<span class="caps">NYLUG</span> Python Workshop today at 6:00PM.  The event is at
the NY Public Library Hudson Park Branch, 66 Leroy St., NY NY 10014
in <span class="caps">NYC</span> and you can <a href="http://nylug.org/pipermail/nylug-announce/2009-June/000795.html">find out more here.</a></p>

	<p>I&#8217;ll be showing people how to set up Lamson, get it installed,
do cool stuff with it, and then just answering questions and helping
people work with it.</p></p>

<h2><a href="/blog/2009-06-08.html">2009-06-08</a> : A Screencast And Docs On Deploying Lamson And OneShotBlog</h2>

<p>	<p>I just finished writing some new documentation on <a href="/docs/deploying_lamson.html">Deploying Lamson and OneShotBlog</a> that
shows you how to install Lamson and all required software into a completely clean Python 2.6 and virtualenv configuration.
The instructions take you from nothing to a running <a href="http://oneshotblog.com/">oneshotblog.com</a> installation that you can 
play with and hack on.  The process of doing Lamson deployments is still a little too rough for me, but these instructions
should get people started.</p>

	<p>I also created the first screencast <a href="/videos/">teaching you how to do the same deployment</a> but stopping at installing
<a href="http://oneshotblog.com">oneshotblog.com</a> to keep things short.  It is basically me talking and typing into a terminal 
window to 12 minutes showing you how to do it.  You can also <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/Lamsonproject.orgDeployLamsonInAVirtualenv">download the video</a>
from <a href="http://archive.org/">archive.org</a> to get a better viewing experience.</p></p>

<h2><a href="/blog/2009-06-06.html">2009-06-06</a> : Lamson 0.9.3 Is Out And Sexy As Hell</h2>

<p>	<p>This release is the result of me working on my little
<a href="http://oneshotblog.com/">oneshotblog.com</a> project while tweaking and refining
Lamson as I go.  The end result is 0.9.3 didn&#8217;t have a lot of big code changes,
but all the tiny little changes add up to a very nice release.  The highlights
of this release are more secure server runs, better character encoding handling
for headers, various cleanups in how mail is queued, and fixes for Python 2.6
support.</p>

	<p>My plan is to keep using this release, improving what is there currently and
only adding minimal features, and just making what is there tighter.  The goal
is to <strong>have a 1.0 release out</strong> once I&#8217;ve used it on
<a href="http://oneshotblog.com/">oneshotblog.com</a> and the new <a href="/lists/">lamsonproject.org
mailing lists</a> application.</p></p>

<h2><a href="/blog/2009-06-04.html">2009-06-04</a> : OneShotBlog Sample (Hack) Running</h2>

<p>	<p>I <strong>finally</strong> got off my ass and put the <a href="http://oneshotblog.com/">OneShotBlog</a> sample up.
This is the code (plus a few little tweaks) from the sample that is in the <a href="/releases/">Lamson source</a>
running on another server.  It&#8217;s using all the features of Lamson, include the new <a href="/docs/deferred_processing_to_queues.html">Queue Receiver</a>
functionality.  So far it&#8217;s working great considering I&#8217;ve just been hacking on it on the side to try
out the usability of the Lamson <a href="/docs/api/">APIs</a> and not really taken it seriously.</p>

	<p>The concept of the oneshotblog is a little weird:</p></p>

<h2><a href="/blog/2009-06-03.html">2009-06-03</a> : Lamson 0.9.1 Out, New Docs</h2>

<p>	<p>I released Lamson 0.9.1 today so please <a href="/download.html">grab it and test it</a> and shoot me feedback.</p>

	<p>The little changes are easier handling of attachments in MailRequest, a
small tweak to spam_filter, and then a bunch of test enhancements and extra
gear.  The big change is a redesign to lamson.args so that it infers the
command line arguments from the lamson.commands function keyword arguments.
It&#8217;s mostly an internal change since others can&#8217;t write their own commands
(yet).</p></p>

<h2><a href="/blog/2009-06-03-2.html">2009-06-03-2</a> : Lamson 0.9.2, Test Coverage 97%</h2>

<p>	<p>The 0.9.2 release is out and ready for everyone to easy_install.  I spent the
day getting rid of my tech debt by boosting the Lamson test coverage to a
whopping 97%.</p>

	<p>I also wrote new documentation on <a href="http://lamsonproject.org/docs/deferred_processing_to_queues.html">Running A Queue Receiver</a> in a separate process using Lamson.</p></p>

<h2><a href="/blog/2009-06-01.html">2009-06-01</a> : Lamson 0.9 Is Out, Find My Bugs!</h2>

<p>
I just pushed Lamson 0.9 up to PyPI for everyone to grab and break.  This release 
features a complete redesign of the routing, state handling, templating, and a full 
set of very complete documentation.  Everyone who was using 0.8.x series should be able 
to migrate to this version with some work, but it won&#8217;t be terribly painful (assuming
you have unit tests).

<p>	<p>I have been working hard on the documentation and scrubbing the code for Lamson and the 0.9 release
coming out soon.  The only things I feel I need to do before an official 0.9 release are:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Clean up the one-shot-blog demo application a bit more.</li>
		<li>Write a small set of instructions on writing your own <a href="http://lamsonproject.org/docs/api/lamson.routing.StateStorage-class.html">StateStorage.</a></li>
		<li>Do a last final code review to check for any obvious problems.</li>

<h2><a href="/blog/2009-05-28.html">2009-05-28</a> : 0.9-pre2 Up For Testing, Docs Too</h2>

<p>	<p>First off, my apologies to everyone if your <span class="caps">RSS</span> reader went crazy today.
I include documentation changes in the <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed so that people can
easily track updates to the Lamson docs.  However, that means when I&#8217;m
writing a lot of documentation it hits the feed repeatedly.</p>

	<p>The good news though is that you can now get at the 0.9-pre2 release of
Lamson from the <a href="/releases/">releases</a> page and you can read the great
new documentation I&#8217;ve got.</p></p>

<h2><a href="/blog/2009-05-24.html">2009-05-24</a> : Features For The 0.9 Release (Soon)</h2>

<p>
<p>I've been hard at work cooking up the very nice new routing system, and
I must say it is rather tasty.  I've gone and created a whole new
routing and state management design that uses decorators right in your
handler modules to indicate how each state will expect mail addresses.
</p>

<p>
For the 0.9 release happening tomorrow I've got a new Router setup,
spam filtering baked in nice and clean, improved test coverage, and 
indirect state storage for those who don't like SQLAlchemy.

for creating a new <a href="http://lamsonproject.org/">lamsonproject.org</a> site layout and
design.  The new site should be easier to read, have more breathing room, and look
easier on the eyes.  It&#8217;s even got a logo:</p>

a bug, put Lamson to work doing Lamson&#8217;s mailing lists, and use Lamson to do
some spam blocking on my own email account.</p>

<p>	<p>Today I launched the Lamson Project site at
<a href="http://lamsonproject.org/">lamsonproject.org</a> and started filling in the
content.  Lamson is really turning into a fun and useful project, and hopefully
the site will get other people interested in it and using it.</p>

	<p>I took the design from one of the many free web design sites and reused the same Python blog script that I use on <a href="http://zedshaw.com/">my own site</a> so getting this up and running was cake.</p></p>
