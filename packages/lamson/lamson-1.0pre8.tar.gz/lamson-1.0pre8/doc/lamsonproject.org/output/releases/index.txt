Title: Lamson Releases

You can get the Lamson source in various ways:

* Download it from "the Launchpad project page":https://launchpad.net/lamson/+download
* Use "Bazaar":http://bazaar-vcs.org/ to get the code with *bzr branch lp:lamson*

And don't forget you can install it with easy_install as well:

<pre class="code">
sudo easy_install --upgrade lamson
</pre>

bq. If easy_install doesn't work, try without --upgrade, and if that doesn't work then
look in your site-packages directory and delete all the versions of Lamson you find.


h2. Releases

You can get the 1.0pre6 release source from the this site as well:

"1.0pre6 release tar.gz":/releases/lamson-1.0pre6.tar.gz

"1.0pre6 release Python Egg":/releases/lamson-1.0pre6-py2.5.egg

This version has been tested, but it is a fairly big change from the 0.8.x series.  You should be able
to migrate your code to 1.0pre6 quickly, but you'll want to read through the documentation, and I hope you had
tests for everything.


h2. Examples

You can get the One-Shot-Blog example by grabbing the above source, untarring it, and then look in example/osb.
