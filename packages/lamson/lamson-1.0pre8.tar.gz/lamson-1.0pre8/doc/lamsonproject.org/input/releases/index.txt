Title: Lamson Releases

You can get the Lamson source in various ways:

* Download it from "support site latest leaf":http://support.lamsonproject.org/leaves as a "Zip file":http://support.lamsonproject.org/zip/Lamson%20Project-bb1b0a0dae.zip?uuid=bb1b0a0daec593f4b62521b2f9b2b725bf4589ac
* Use "Fossil":fossil-scm.org to get the code as described on the "support site":http://support.lamsonproject.org/home


And don't forget you can install it with easy_install as well:

<pre class="code">
sudo easy_install --upgrade lamson
</pre>

bq. If easy_install doesn't work, try without --upgrade, and if that doesn't work then
look in your site-packages directory and delete all the versions of Lamson you find.
