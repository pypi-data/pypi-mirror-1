Title: Downloading Lamson

You can get the Lamson source in various ways:

* Download it from "the Launchpad project page":https://launchpad.net/lamson/+download
* Use "Bazaar":http://bazaar-vcs.org/ to get the code with *bzr branch lp:lamson*

If neither of those work for you, then you can get a probably out of date release 
from here:

"0.8.3 release":/releases/lamson-0.8.3.tar.gz

This release is only updated when there are major releases to distribute.

h2. Installing With Easy Install

Using easy_install is the easiest way to install, simply run "sudo easy_install lamson" and
it will do the work of getting the dependencies and setting everything up.

h2. Installing With setup.py

Once you get the source, you can also use setup.py to install Lamson.  First make sure that
you have *SQLAlchemy*, *Mako*, and *nose* installed:

<code>
$ sudo easy_install sqlalchemy
$ sudo easy_install mako
$ sudo easy_install nose
</code>

If you refuse to use easy_install entirely then it is on you to find these projects and 
install them how you see best.  *Make sure you have the most recent version of all 
dependencies.*

Then you can use this command to install:

<code>
$ python setup.py install
</code>

h2. Installing Into A Virtual Env

If you do this please send "/contact.html" the instructions and I'll post them.
