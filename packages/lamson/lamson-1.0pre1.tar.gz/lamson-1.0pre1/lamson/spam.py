"""
Uses the SpamBayes system to perform filtering and classification
of email.  It's designed so that you attach a single decorator
to the state functions you need to be "spam free", and then use the
lamson.spam.Filter code to do training.

SpamBayes comes with extensive command line tools for processing
maildir and mbox for spam.  A good way to train SpamBayes is to 
take mail that you know is spam and stuff it into a maildir, then
periodically use the SpamBayes tools to train from that.
