Title: Lamson 1.0pre1 Released




340: Added a version command finally, with some good information.
339: md5 was deprecated, using hashlib.
330: There is now a safe=False option to lamson.queue.Queue to use a modified Maildir that md5 hashes the original hostname used.
329: Found an email that had a nasty header causing an edge case in the parser.
325: Bounce detection was using the wrong email address.
323: librelist.com sample is looking good, bounce handling is working, archives are started.
322: Super bounce handling for librelist.com.
321: Routing it more deterministic and a bit quicker.  It now uses the envelope To for routing.
320: Refactored the routing to it is more deterministic and doesn't loop over the functions mulitple times.  Still some work to do though.
319: Removed the egg dependency on sqlalchemy.
318: Moved the bounce stuff around in order to make it more advanced.
317: Removed references to SQLAlchemy being needed in the docs.
314: Bounce information now includes the original messages in easier to access forms.
308: Got bounce handling working and tested.
307: Fixed up the @bounce_to decorator so that it returns the next state.
306: Got the first cut of the whole app.handlers.admin working, including bounces, but Lamson bounce detection has a flaw.
305: Got the basics of making mailing lists, managing subscribers.
304: Initial commit of the librelist.com sample application.
303: Slight reorg with the way @state_key_generator is implemented.
302: Implemented a means to specify that a module will key off of different parts of a message.
301: Got tired of not seeing errors during test runs so I made an option in the Router to explode on exceptions vs. log them.
300: Bounce routing decorator for doing the actual routing of messages that are bounces.
296: Implemented a bounce analysis method that is simple but seems to work on most bounce mail.
294: Small bug in multipart handling where content types of 'message/' can be multipart too.
