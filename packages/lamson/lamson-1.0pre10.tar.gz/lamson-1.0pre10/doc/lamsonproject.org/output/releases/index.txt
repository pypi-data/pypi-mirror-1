Title: Lamson Releases

You can get the Lamson source in various ways:

* Download it from "support site 1.0pre9 tag":http://support.lamsonproject.org/vinfo/c2be9dedc35f72294ed38010bd4fdd20fa29bb2b as a "Zip file":http://support.lamsonproject.org/zip/Lamson%20Project-c2be9dedc3.zip?uuid=c2be9dedc35f72294ed38010bd4fdd20fa29bb2b
* Use "Fossil":http://fossil-scm.org to get the code as described on the "support site":http://support.lamsonproject.org/home


And don't forget you can install it with easy_install as well:

<pre class="code">
sudo easy_install --upgrade lamson
</pre>

bq. If easy_install doesn't work, try without --upgrade, and if that doesn't work then
look in your site-packages directory and delete all the versions of Lamson you find.
