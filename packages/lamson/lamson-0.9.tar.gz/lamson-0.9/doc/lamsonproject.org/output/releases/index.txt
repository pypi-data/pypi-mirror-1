Title: Lamson Releases

You can get the Lamson source in various ways:

* Download it from "the Launchpad project page":https://launchpad.net/lamson/+download
* Use "Bazaar":http://bazaar-vcs.org/ to get the code with *bzr branch lp:lamson*

h2. Pre-Releases

There's going to be a 0.9 release very soon now, so you can try out the source manually using:

"0.9-pre3 release":/releases/lamson-0.9-pre3.tar.gz

This version will have no guarantees for stability, but it should work.  You'll especailly want pre-releases
if you were using the 0.8 version of Lamson and need to migrate to the new routing and testing setups.


h2. Examples

You can get the One-Shot-Blog example by grabbing the above source, untarring it, and then look in example/osb.
