Description: an_example_pypi_project
        =======================
        
        This is just a demonstration vehicle used to take you through the process
        -- start to finish -- of creating a Python project that can be:
        
        1. Uploaded to
        2. Distributed from
        
        and
        
        3. Documented on
        
        the Python Package Index (aka pypi or the cheeseshop) at http://pypi.python.org/pypi.
        This project uses setuptools, Sphinx, and the Sphinx-PyPI-upload package at
        http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Sphinx-PyPI-upload/0.2.1.
        
        This demonstration is not meant to be complete nor authoritative. It's just a
        recording of the steps I took to get some projects onto pypi and
        hopefully it might save someone some time from googling around.  To be sure,
        this is simply just *one* way to make a project, document it, and get it
        on pypi.
        
        NOTE: This was original given as a talk to the Minnesota Python Users Group
        http://groups.google.com/group/pymntos/ and was developed for a
        spoken presentation format.
