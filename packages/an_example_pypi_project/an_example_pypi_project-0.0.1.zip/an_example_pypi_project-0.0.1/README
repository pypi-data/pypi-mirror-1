an_example_pypi_project
=======================

An example pypi project. This is just a demonstration vehicle used to 
illustrate how to create, document, and publish a project to cheeseshop
or the Python Package Index (pypi) at http://pypi.python.org/pypi using 
setuptools, Sphinx, and the Sphinx-PyPI-upload package at
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Sphinx-PyPI-upload/0.2.1. 

This demonstration is not meant to be complete nor authoritative. It's just a 
recording of the steps I took to get some projects onto pypi and 
hopefully it might save someone some time from googling around.

The basic idea here is not to be exhaustive in the treatment of any one topic
but rather to cover from start to finish everything you need to 
do in order to get a package onto pypi.  

The reason this project is being put on pypi is so a reader can see the actual
output on pypi created by these example files.
