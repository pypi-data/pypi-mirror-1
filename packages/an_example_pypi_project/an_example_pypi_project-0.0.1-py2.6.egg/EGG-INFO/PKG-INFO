Description: an_example_pypi_project
        =======================
        
        An example pypi project. This is just a demonstration vehicle used to
        illustrate how to create, document, and publish a project to cheeseshop
        or the Python Package Index (pypi) at http://pypi.python.org/pypi using
        setuptools, Sphinx, and the Sphinx-PyPI-upload package at
        http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Sphinx-PyPI-upload/0.2.1.
        
        This demonstration is not meant to be complete nor authoritative. It's just a
        recording of the steps I took to get some projects onto pypi and
        hopefully it might save someone some time from googling around.
        
        The basic idea here is not to be exhaustive in the treatment of any one topic
        but rather to cover from start to finish everything you need to
        do in order to get a package onto pypi.
        
        The reason this project is being put on pypi is so a reader can see the actual
        output on pypi created by these example files.
