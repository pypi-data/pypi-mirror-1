Description: A pure Python package providing the core RDF constructs.
        
        The packages is intended to provide the core RDF types and interfaces
        that other packages can build on. The package defines a plugin
        interface for parsers, stores, and serializers that other packages can
        use to implement parsers, stores, and serializers that will plug into
        the rdf package.
        
        The `rdf` package does not itself contain any plugin
        implementation. So, you will want to install a library that builds
        upon `rdf` and defines some plugin implementations. One such library
        is `rdflib` version 3.x.
        
        The primary interface `rdf` exposes to work with RDF is
        `rdf.graph.Graph`.
        
        A tiny example:
        
        
        >>> from rdf.graph import Graph
        
        >>> g = Graph()
        >>> result = g.parse("http://eikeon.com/foaf.rdf")
        
        >>> print "graph has %s statements." % len(g)
        graph has 34 statements.
        >>>
        >>> for s, p, o in g:
        ...     if (s, p, o) not in g:
        ...         raise Exception("It better be!")
        
        >>> s = g.serialize(format='n3')
