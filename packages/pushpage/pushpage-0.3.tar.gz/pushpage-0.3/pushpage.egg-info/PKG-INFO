Description: "Push"-mode is jargon used in a number of templating systems to describe templates which have their data "pushed" to them as a mapping, supplied by the application.  Tradiional ZPT contexts include top-level variables (e.g., "context") from which the template "pulls" data.  This package offers a variant of ZPT which suppresses any context variables except those explicitly passed by the caller.
