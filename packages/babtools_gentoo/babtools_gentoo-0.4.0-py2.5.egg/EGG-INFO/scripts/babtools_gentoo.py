"""babtools_gentoo: Some tools for working with Gentoo.
 

Usage: 
 - babtools_gentoo.py cmd [OPTIONS]
   
   for default usage, or 
   
 - babtools_gentoo.py --help
   
   for getting help
 

Avaible commands: 
 - ebuild_to_local CP
   
   CP (cathegory/package) in the simple form dev-lang/python or similar. CPVs (cathegory/package-version) aren't supported, yet. 
    
 - ebuild_download_to_local CP URL
  
   Download an ebuild from bugs.gentoo.org to the local portage tree.    
   
 - emerge_from_pypi PACKAGE
  
   Create an ebuild from a project in PyPI, put it into package.keywords and install it. 
   Honors package.keywords directories. 
   It only puts the directly named PACKAGE into package.keywords as dev-python/PACKAGE
   but doesn't put the dependencies into package.keywords. 
 

Examples: 
 - sudo babtools_gentoo.py ebuild_to_local dev-lang/python
   
   copy dev-lang/python into the local overlay
   
 - sudo babtools_gentoo.py ebuild_download_to_local games-rpg/vegastrike http://bugs.gentoo.org/attachment.cgi?id=151789
   
   Download the ebuild for games-rpg/vegastrike from bugs.gentoo.org and digest it. 
  
 - sudo babtools_gentoo.py emerge_from_pypi magma
   
   Create an ebuild for "magma" from the PyPI and emerge it.
