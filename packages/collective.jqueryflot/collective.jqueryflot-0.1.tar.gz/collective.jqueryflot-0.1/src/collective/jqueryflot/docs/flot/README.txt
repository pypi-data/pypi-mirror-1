What's with the name?
---------------------

First: it's pronounced with a short o, like "plot". Not like "flawed".

So "Flot" is like "Plot".

And if you look up "flot" in a Danish-to-English dictionary, some up
the words that come up are "good-looking", "attractive", "stylish",
"smart", "impressive", "extravagant". One of the main goals with Flot
is pretty looks. Flot is supposed to be "flot".
