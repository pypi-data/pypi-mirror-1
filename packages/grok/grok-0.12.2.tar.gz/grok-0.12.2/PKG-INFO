        What is grok?
        =============
        
        Grok makes it easier to get started with a Zope 3 web application.
        
        Grok uses the Component Architecture and builds on Zope 3 concepts
        like content objects (models), views, and adapters.  Its simplicity
        lies in using **convention over configuration** and **sensible
        defaults** when wiring components together.  That means neither a
        configuration language like ZCML nor a lot of repetition are needed to
        create a web application with grok.
        
        You can find out much more about Grok at our http://grok.zope.org
        website.
        
        Who is grok?
        ============
        
        Grok is a friendly caveman from the Stone Age.  He has a big club that
        he hunts mammoths with.  He will also use this club to smash anything
        he doesn't like.
        
        "ME GROK SMASH ZCML!"
        
        Getting grok
        ============
        
        The easiest way to get started with grok is to install the
        `grokproject <http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/grokproject>`_ package
        (e.g. via ``easy_install grokproject``) and then create a new project
        area by calling the ``grokproject`` script like so::
        
        $ grokproject MyProject
        ... many lines of output here
        
        This will create a project area in ``MyProject`` as well as download
        and install grok and Zope 3 (the application server grok is built on).
        
        You can also get grok from the subversion repository::
        
        svn co svn://svn.zope.org/repos/main/grok/trunk grok
        
        Then follow the instructions of ``INSTALL.txt``.
        
        Grok changes
        ************
        
        0.12.2 (20008-12-12)
        ====================
        
        Bug fixes
        ---------
        
        * Fix serious security issue.
        
        0.12.1 (2008-05-31)
        ===================
        
        Bug fixes
        ---------
        
        * Fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/231106: Use the
        viewletmanager.sort() method for sorting viewlets by using
        util.sort_components().
        
        * grok.REST views now have a properly set ``__parent__`` attribute and
        will correctly allow acquisition from parent objects, as it's used
        by the security policy for acquiring local grants, for example.
        
        * Fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/229677:
        zope.app.securitypolicy egg missing. Now zope.app.securitypolicy
        3.4.6 is additionally required by Grok and fetched by buildout.
        
        * The grokkers for adapters and global utilities did not use the
        correct value for the *provided* interface in the configuration
        action discriminator.  Because of this, uninformative and
        potentially wrong conflict errors would occur, as well as no
        conflict where a conflict should have occurred.
        
        * The grokker for the ``global_utility()`` directive did immediate
        registrations instead of generating configuration actions.
        Therefore it did not provoke ``ConflictErrors`` for conflicting
        registrations.
        
        * Removed quickly hacked testsetup code from grok.testing.
        
        * Port fix of zope.formlib to correctly adapt the context to a FormField's
        interface, not the field.
        
        0.12 (2008-04-22)
        =================
        
        Feature changes
        ---------------
        
        * The new release needs new version of grokproject, please do::
        
        $ easy_install -U grokproject
        
        * Added testsetup classes in grok.testing to improve easy setup of
        unit- and functional tests.
        
        * Add support for viewlets and viewlet managers, ``grok.Viewlet``
        and ``grok.ViewletManager``.
        
        * Add a new directive, ``grok.order()``, which can be used to help
        sort components. At the time it is not used yet, but we intend to
        use it for the viewlets support. Note that this means Grok now
        requires Martian 0.9.3 or higher. See ``grok.interfaces`` for more
        documentation on this directive.
        
        * Now depend on ``z3c.autoinclude``. This allows the use of the
        ``<includeDependencies package="."/>`` directive, which automatically loads
        up ZCML needed for the dependencies listed in your project's
        ``setup.py``. The new release of grokproject adds this line
        automatically. Upgrade ``grokproject`` to make use of this
        functionality in new projects::
        
        $ easy_install -U grokproject
        
        * Classes that end with "-Base" are no longer implicitly considered base
        classes. These classes need to have the grok.baseclass() directive added to
        them explicitly.
        
        See also the `upgrade notes`_ for information on how to update
        your existing projects.

        Bug fixes
        ---------
        
        * Do not register the publishTraverse and browserDefault methods of the
        JSON component as views.
        
        * Methods with names that start with an '_' are not registered as views
        for XMLRPC, REST and JSON components.
        
        * Use a configuration action for the registration of the static directory.
        
        * Fix imports from zope.app.securitypolicy.
        
        * Grok does not raise a GrokError anymore when it finds unassociated
        templates, but will issue a UserWarning.
        
        * Fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/161948: grok.testing.grok()
        now also loads the ZPT template factories so that unit tests that
        need to configure views with ZPT templates continue to work.
        
        * Changed a few remaining references to ``grok.grok`` and
        ``grok.grok_component`` to their correct equivalents in
        ``grok.testing``.
        
        * ``grok.testing.grok_component()`` could not be used in a pure
        doctest. This needed a bugfix in Martian (since 0.9.2). Add a test
        that demonstrates this problem.
        
        * Fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/162437: grok.Form and its
        subclasses did not implement IBrowserView.
        
        * Fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/185414: grok introspector
        was broken for zipped eggs.
        
        * Fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/125720: server control form
        had shutdown as default action, even when entering an admin message.
        
        * Fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/80403: Fix situation where
        a module name is identical to the package name. At least modules
        with templates can now have same name as their package.
        
        * Multiple skins and REST protocols could be registered under the same
        name, but this is actually a conflict. Now give configuration
        conflict error when someone tries this.
        
        * Overriding traversal behavior using the ``traverse()`` method or
        ``grok.Traverser`` failed in the face of (REST) ``PUT`` and
        ``DELETE``. XML-RPC also failed when custom traversal was in use.
        
        * Fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/187590 where config action
        discriminators for permission and role registrations were incorrect.
        
        * Permission definitions received the wrong, too high, configure
        action priority (not to be confused with grokker priority). In some
        cases this caused permissions to be defined later than they were
        used. Use a low action priority instead for permissions.
        
        Restructuring
        -------------
        
        * Refactor commonalities out of meta.py.
        
        * zope.app.securitypolicy is no longer used. zope.securitypolicy provides
        all securitypolicy features used by Grok.
        
        0.11 (2007-11-08)
        =================
        
        Feature changes
        ---------------
        
        * Integrated skins and layers: ``grok.layer``, ``grok.IGrokLayer``,
        ``grok.Skin``.
        
        * Grok now supports hooking in new template languages without much work.
        See also doc/minitutorials/template-languages.txt. See Restructuring below
        for more techinical info.
        
        * Accessing a template macro via context/@@the_view/the_template is now
        deprecated for the standard ZPT story of using
        context/@@the_view/macro/the_template.
        
        * There is now a grok.direct() directive that can be used on GlobalUtilities
        to mark that the class provides the utility interface directly and need
        no instantiation.
        
        * Removed ``grok.define_permission`` in favor of the
        ``grok.Permission`` component base class. You should now subclass
        this base class to define permissions. See also
        doc/minitutorials/permissions.txt
        
        * Added the ``grok.Role`` component base class to define roles.
        
        * The admin UI now displays and offers deletion of broken objects.
        
        * Removed support for defining model schemas using an inner class with
        the special name ``fields``. This was abandoned in favor the usual
        Zope 3 way of defining schemas in interfaces and implementing them
        in our Grok models.
        
        * Integrated REST support. See doc/minitutorials/rest.txt for usage
        information.
        
        Bug fixes
        ---------
        
        * Remove zc.recipe.egg, zc.recipe.filestorage, zc.recipe.testrunner,
        zc.zope3recipes from version requirements.
        
        * The admin UI now shows interfaces in modules.
        
        * ``handle...`` is not a special function name anymore.
        
        * Views no longer need a custom ``AbsoluteURL`` view to determine
        their URL, since each instance now properly gets a ``__name__``
        attribute.
        
        * buildout.cfg extends versions.cfg to pin down the versions of the
        dependency tree. See also http://grok.zope.org/releaseinfo/readme.html
        
        Restructuring
        -------------
        
        * Grokkers now emit configuration actions, much like ZCML directive
        handlers do. If you defined custom grokkers, see doc/upgrade.txt for
        more information.
        
        * The new pluggable template language support includes some restructuring:
        
        - GrokPageTemplate is now split up into two. BaseTemplate, on which all
        templates need to be based, and GrokTemplate, which also provides a
        set of methods for easy integration of templating languages.
        
        - All objects based on GrokTemplate are now grokked, instead of having
        separate grokkers for each type of template.
        
        - The View is now completely template-language agnostic, which makes it
        easy to hook in new page template languages.
        
        - There are now new interfaces (ITemplate and ITemplateFileFactory)
        used when you implement support for a new templating language.
        
        * Changed the way grok's functional tests are set up.  Instead of each
        test case doing its own test setup, it is now done once by the
        ftesting layer.  This avoids ordering problems when some ftests
        would influence the environment of other ftests that were run later
        in time.
        
        0.10.2 (2007-10-24)
        ===================
        
        Bug fixes
        ---------
        
        * Remove zc.recipe.egg, zc.recipe.filestorage, zc.recipe.testrunner,
        zc.zope3recipes from version requirements.
        
        * Require zope.app.error = 3.5.1
        
        0.10.1 (2007-10-10)
        ===================
        
        Bug fixes
        ---------
        
        * buildout.cfg extends versions.cfg to pin down the versions of the
        dependency tree. This should avoid the situation where we release
        Grok, some dependency changes, and Grok breaks as a result. In
        conjunction with this we will also be releasing a new version of
        grokproject that will use this version infrastructure by default.
        
        For more information about this change, see:
        http://grok.zope.org/releaseinfo/readme.html
        
        0.10 (2007-08-21)
        =================
        
        Feature changes
        ---------------
        
        * Integrated admin user interface.
        
        * Configuration using Martian (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/martian).
        
        * Flash message infrastructure included.
        
        * Adjust dependencies for Grok so that grokproject should work on
        Windows.
        
        Bug fixes
        ---------
        
        * A fix in Martian where multiple grok.Model or grok.Container classes
        could result in something being found as a context twice.
