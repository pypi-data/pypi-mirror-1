Grok Tutorial Samples installation
----------------------------------

The Grok tutorial samples make use of a system called buildout. First,
we'll set up a buildout script that can be reused by all tutorials. Just
type this in the ``groktut`` directory::

  $ python2.4 bootstrap.py

This will download and install buildout. It will create various
directories, only one of which, ``eggs``, is important. This directory
contains all Python eggs shared by the tutorial samples.  If you
already have a directory for sharing eggs with other buildouts, you
can edit ``buildout_tut.cfg`` and change the ``eggs-directory`` option
to point to this directory, e.g.::

  [buildout]
  eggs-directory = /home/me/shared-eggs

Now go to the tutorial sample you'd like to look at and launch
buildout::

  $ cd an_empty_grok_project
  $ ../buildout -N

The -N option tells the buildout_ system not to look for newer files
on the network. This greatly speeds up the buildout process if you
have all required eggs already available, like the second time you run
the buildout of a sample, as it skips network access.

.. _buildout: http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout

You will have a separate Zope instance created for you in each
tutorial directory you run the buildout script. From the specific
tutorial directory, you can start up Zope like this::

  $ bin/instance fg

Zope should then be running on port 8080 (http://localhost:8080).

Just Ctrl-C when you're done.
