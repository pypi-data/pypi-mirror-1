* `Newbie Search Tutorial </minitutorials/searching.html>`_:

  Grok supports the vanilla indexing services available in Zope 3
  straight out of the box. The catalog uses developer-defined indexes
  for searching. In other words, you have to define the indexes you
  want to use to search you objects before you perform the actual
  search.

* `Macros With Grok </minitutorials/macros.html>`_:

  Macros are a way to define a chunk of presentation in one template,
  and share it in others. Changes to the macro are immediately
  reflected in all templates, that use it.
