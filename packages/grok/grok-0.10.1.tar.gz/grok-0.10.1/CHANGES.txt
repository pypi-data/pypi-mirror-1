Grok changes
************

0.10.1 (2007-10-10)
===================

Bug fixes
---------

* buildout.cfg extends versions.cfg to pin down the versions of the
  dependency tree. This should avoid the situation where we release
  Grok, some dependency changes, and Grok breaks as a result. In
  conjunction with this we will also be releasing a new version of
  grokproject that will use this version infrastructure by default.

0.10 (2007-08-21)
=================

Feature changes
---------------

* Integrated admin user interface.

* Configuration using Martian (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/martian).

* Flash message infrastructure included.

* Adjust dependencies for Grok so that grokproject should work on
  Windows.

Bug fixes
---------

* A fix in Martian where multiple grok.Model or grok.Container classes
  could result in something being found as a context twice.
