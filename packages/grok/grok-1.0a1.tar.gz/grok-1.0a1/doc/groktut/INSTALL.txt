Grok Tutorial Samples installation
----------------------------------

To run the Grok tutorial samples we are going to assume you've already
used an up to date version of grokproject to set up your buildout
environment, including a shared eggs directory. If you haven't, the
procedure below will try to download the required eggs over and over
again, which is not very desirable.

One way to make the tutorials build quickly is to have a centrally
installed version of buildout, for instance in your homedirectory's
``bin`` directory. If so you can just change directory into the
directories for each tutorial and run ``buildout -N`` there.

Alternatively we can install buildout here specifically for the
tutorials. Just type this in the ``groktut`` directory::

  $ python2.4 bootstrap.py

This will download and install buildout in the ``groktut`` directory.

Now you can go to the tutorial sample you'd like to look at and launch
buildout::

  $ cd an_empty_grok_project
  $ ../buildout -N

The ``-N`` option tells the buildout_ system not to look for newer
files on the network. This greatly speeds up the buildout process if
you have all required eggs already available.

You will have a separate Zope instance created for you in each
tutorial directory you run the buildout script. From the specific
tutorial directory, you can start up Zope like this::

  $ bin/instance fg

Zope should then be running on port 8080 (http://localhost:8080).

Just Ctrl-C when you're done.
