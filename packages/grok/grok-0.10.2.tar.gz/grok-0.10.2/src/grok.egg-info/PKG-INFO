        What is grok?
        =============
        
        Grok makes it easier to get started with a Zope 3 web application.
        
        Grok uses the Component Architecture and builds on Zope 3 concepts
        like content objects (models), views, and adapters.  Its simplicity
        lies in using **convention over configuration** and **sensible
        defaults** when wiring components together.  That means neither a
        configuration language like ZCML nor a lot of repetition are needed to
        create a web application with grok.
        
        You can find out much more about Grok at our http://grok.zope.org
        website.
        
        Who is grok?
        ============
        
        Grok is a friendly caveman from the Stone Age.  He has a big club that
        he hunts mammoths with.  He will also use this club to smash anything
        he doesn't like.
        
        "ME GROK SMASH ZCML!"
        
        Getting grok
        ============
        
        The easiest way to get started with grok is to install the
        `grokproject <http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/grokproject>`_ package
        (e.g. via ``easy_install grokproject``) and then create a new project
        area by calling the ``grokproject`` script like so::
        
        $ grokproject MyProject
        ... many lines of output here
        
        This will create a project area in ``MyProject`` as well as download
        and install grok and Zope 3 (the application server grok is built on).
        
        You can also get grok from the subversion repository::
        
        svn co svn://svn.zope.org/repos/main/grok/trunk grok
        
        Then follow the instructions of ``INSTALL.txt``.
        
        Grok changes
        ************
        
        0.10.2 (2007-10-24)
        ===================
        
        Bug fixes
        ---------
        
        * Remove zc.recipe.egg, zc.recipe.filestorage, zc.recipe.testrunner,
        zc.zope3recipes from version requirements.
        
        * Require zope.app.error = 3.5.1
        
        0.10.1 (2007-10-10)
        ===================
        
        Bug fixes
        ---------
        
        * buildout.cfg extends versions.cfg to pin down the versions of the
        dependency tree. This should avoid the situation where we release
        Grok, some dependency changes, and Grok breaks as a result. In
        conjunction with this we will also be releasing a new version of
        grokproject that will use this version infrastructure by default.

        * Adjust dependencies for Grok so that grokproject should work on
        Windows.
        
        Bug fixes
        ---------
        
        * A fix in Martian where multiple grok.Model or grok.Container classes
        could result in something being found as a context twice.
