Preparing for grok development
------------------------------

Grok is installed via buildout <http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout>.

You may have setuptools already installed for your system Python. In
that case, you may need to upgrade it first because buildout requires
a very recent version::

    $ sudo easy_install -U setuptools

If this command fails because easy_install is not available, there is
a good chance you do not have setuptools available for your system
Python. If so, there is no problem because setuptools will be
installed locally by buildout.

Bootstrap the buildout environment::

    $ python bootstrap/bootstrap.py

and run the buildout command::

    $ bin/buildout
    [lots of stuff will be downloaded and installed locally here]

Running the demo applications
-----------------------------

Start the instance:

    $ cd parts/instance
    $ bin/zopectl fg

If you now connect to port 8080 and log in with username 'grok',
password 'grok', you should be able to add the grok-based applications
(such as grokwiki) from the menu.

Running the tests
-----------------

Grok's tests are easily run by executing the test runner that's
installed in the ``bin`` directory::

    $ bin/test

For functional tests we've set up a special test instance just for
running the test from, which includes the minimum needed ZCML (so the
tests run a tidbit faster).
