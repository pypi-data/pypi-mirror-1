    <h1>${project}</h1>
    <p>This is the default page for the ${project} project.</p>
    <p>The page is called index.html and is part of your application's package,
    ${package}, inside the public/ directory, i.e. ${project}/public/index.html.</p>
    <p>Any files you add to the public directory will be served in preference
    to your application's dynamic resources.</p>
    <p>When you're ready simply delete index.html and your root resource will
    be returned for this URL instead.</p>
