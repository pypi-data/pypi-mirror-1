Description: DoDoStorage is meant as a User-Space write-once Filesystem. Much Inspiration
        is drawn from MoglieFS http://www.danga.com/mogilefs/ - but DoDoStorage it is
        much simpler.
        
        With DoDoStorage you can store files - "Documents" in DoDoStorage speak. For
        each file you get an opaque "Document key" to retrive it. Stored Files are
        immutable - you can't change or delete them. Every Document has an
        "category" whichs help to destinguish classes of Documents, a mime-type and
        a timestamp. It also has a set of arbitrary attributes.
        
        DoDoStorage is meant to be accessed via an RESTful HTTP API.
