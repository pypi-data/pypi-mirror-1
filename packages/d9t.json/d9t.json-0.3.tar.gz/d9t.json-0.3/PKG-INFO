Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This is a json parser. It understands everything within brackets. That means,
        you will give it anything like
        
        {'activePolygonId':null,'polygons':null,'route':null}
        
        Of course deeply nested arrays are fully supported without a limit.

        ========
        
        >>> from d9t.json import parser
        
        Let's define some json data.
        
        >>> json = """ {'data1':null, 'data2':'something', 'data3':[1,2,3,'string',true,{'datanested':'something','floatdata':44.22, 'bool':false}]} """
        >>> domparser = parser.JsDomParser(json)
        >>> data = domparser.parse()
        >>> data
        {'data1': None, 'data3': [1, 2, 3, 'string', True, {'datanested': 'something', 'bool': False, 'floatdata': 44.219999999999999}], 'data2': 'something'}
        
        That's it ;)
