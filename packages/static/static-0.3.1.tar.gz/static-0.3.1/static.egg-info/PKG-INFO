Description: This distribution provides an easy way to include static content
        in your WSGI applications. There is a convenience method for serving
        files located via pkg_resources. There are also facilities for serving
        mixed (static and dynamic) content using "magic" file handlers.
        Python 2.4 string substitution and Kid template support are provided
        and it is easy to roll your own handlers. Note that this distribution
        does not require Python 2.4 or Kid unless you want to use those types of
        templates.
