Description: Yann's Yet Another Form Library is a web form validtion and metadata library.
        Forms are created as a special class of domain object, which can then be validated and data extracted.
        YYAFL believes in the separation of style from content, and as such is designed to be used
        in several different popular templating systems such as Mako and Cheetah.
