0.9 (2009/1/6)
==============

Backport changes made to ``repoze.tm2`` (the version of this library
which depends only on the ``transaction`` package rather than all of
ZODB).

Docs moved into Sphinx.

0.8
===

Relaxed requirement for ZODB 3.7.2, since we might need to use the
package with other verions.  Note that the tests which depend on
transaction having "doom" semantics don't work with 3.7.2, anyway.

0.7
===

Depend on PyPI release of ZODB 3.7.2.  Upgrade to this by doing
bin/easy_install -U 'ZODB3 >= 3.7.1, < 3.8.0a' if necessary.

0.6
===

after_end.register and after_end.unregister must now be passed a
transaction object rather than a WSGI environment to avoid the
possibility that the WSGI environment used by a child participating in
transaction management won't be the same one used by the repoze.tm
package.

repoze.tm now inserts a key into the WSGI environment
(``repoze.tm.active``) if it's active in the WSGI pipeline.  An API
function, repoze.tm:isActive can be called with a single argument, the
WSGI environment, to check if the middleware is active.

0.5
===

Depend on rerolled ZODB 3.7.1 instead of zopelib.

Add license and copyright, change trove classifiers.

0.4
===

Depend on zopelib rather than ZODB 3.8.0b3 distribution, because the
ZODB distribution pulls in various packages (zope.interface and ZEO
most notably) that are incompatible with stock Zope 2.10.4 apps and
older sandboxes.  We'll need to revisit this.

0.3
===

Provide limited compatibility for older transaction package versions
which don't support the 'transaction.isDoomed' API.

0.2
===

Provide after_end API for registering callbacks at transaction end.

0.1
===
