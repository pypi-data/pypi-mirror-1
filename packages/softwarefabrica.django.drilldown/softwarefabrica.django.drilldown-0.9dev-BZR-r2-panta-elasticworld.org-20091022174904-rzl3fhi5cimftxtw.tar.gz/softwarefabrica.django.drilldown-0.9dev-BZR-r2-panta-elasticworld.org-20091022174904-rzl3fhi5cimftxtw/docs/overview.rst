Overview

This `Django`_ application provides the ability to navigate through a large
number of database objects using a `drill down`_ approach, by progressively
refining the set selecting filter values for model fields.

This provides a great alternative to classic search, especially for large
datasets and in those cases where search criterions are not perfectly clear
up-front.
