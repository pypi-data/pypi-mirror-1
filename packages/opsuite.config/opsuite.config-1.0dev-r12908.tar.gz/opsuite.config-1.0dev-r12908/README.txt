Introduction
============

This package provides a dict-like interface to a global plone.registry and makes guesses about what type each object is when it is first set.

This is intended to smooth configuration migrations from existing dict-like structure to plone.registry. 

    This package is part of the Opinion Suite system, and is licenced under the Affero General Public Licence v3 with options.  See LICENSE.txt for more information.
