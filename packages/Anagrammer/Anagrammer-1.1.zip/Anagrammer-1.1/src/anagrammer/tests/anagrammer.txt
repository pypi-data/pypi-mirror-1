To demonstrate, let's set up a fake word list and convert it:

    >>> PATH="/tmp"
    >>> from anagrammer import convert
    >>> f = open("%s/doctest.lst" % PATH, 'w')
    >>> print >>f, "cat"
    >>> print >>f, "act"
    >>> print >>f, "at"
    >>> print >>f, "dog"
    >>> f.close()
    >>> convert.convert("%s/doctest.lst" % PATH, PATH)

And now test it:

    >>> df = "%s/doctest.anagram" % PATH
    >>> words = ['cat']

With the column option, things appear in simple lists:

    >>> from anagrammer.anagrammer import anagrammer
    >>> anagrammer(words, df, 3, True)
    cat
    act

And not finding anything is silent:

    >>> anagrammer(words, df, 4, True)

Whereas, without this, it's pretty printed:

    >>> anagrammer(words, df, 3) # doctest:+NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    cat
    3 = 2
      act cat

    >>> anagrammer(words, df, 2)  # doctest:+NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    cat
    3 = 2
      act cat
    2 = 1
      at

And not finding anything emits a polite message:

    >>> anagrammer(words, df, 4)  # doctest:+NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    cat
    None found.
