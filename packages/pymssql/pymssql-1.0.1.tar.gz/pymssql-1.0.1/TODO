Serious/important:
- document in platforms.html why there will not be pymssql binaries for x64
  (no ntwdblib.dll), maybe FreeTDS version on windows in some distant future
- test on Debian x64, FreeBSD x64!
  
Moderate:
- improve inline documentation strings - that's job for English native speakers
- fix apitest_mssql.py
- test on more platforms (especially big-endian ones)
- _mssql_select_db should quote '[' in db name:
  + if first char is [ and last ] then strip them, quote what's left
    and put around [ ]

Low priority:
- try to call dbexit() on module dealloc / python unload (how?)
