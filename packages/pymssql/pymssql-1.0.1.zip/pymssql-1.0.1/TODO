Serious/important:
  
Moderate:
- improve inline documentation strings - that's job for English native speakers
- fix apitest_mssql.py
- test on big-endian platforms
- _mssql_select_db should quote ']' in db name:
  + if first char is [ and last ] then strip them, quote what's left
    and put around [ ]

Low priority:
- try to call dbexit() on module dealloc / python unload (how?)
