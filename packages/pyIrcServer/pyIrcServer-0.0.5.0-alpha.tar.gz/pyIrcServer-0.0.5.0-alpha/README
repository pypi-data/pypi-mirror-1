pyIrcServer is a very personalizable IRC Server that respect every line of the Client/Server RFC. It's made all in python and it's based on modules.
The core is very simple, modules are the most important thing because without them the IRCd can't run.
So there'are standard modules inserted in each release and unofficial modules made by users who use this software and want to add their own features.

SYSTEM REQUIRMENTS:
  Python 2.4 or higher
	PyXML

INSTALLATION:
	$ tar -xjf pyircserver-version.tar.bz2
	Open config.py and configure it

Running as daemon:
	$ ./ircd.py start

Getting help:
	$ ./ircd.py --help

Check the version:
	$ ./ircd.py --version
	
Crypting passwords:
	$ python ./utils/crypt.py
	Insert the password
	Copy the result and quit the program
	Modify config.py by changing the password with the newest and enable 'cryptpwd' option

Running in debug mode:
	If you are a developer and you need to debug pyIrcServer, just add --debug option after the main option:
	$ ./ircd.py start|stop|restart|rehash --debug
	Debug mode will show messages which shouldn't be seen in normal mode and are not needed to non-developers.

WINDOWS USERS:
You only have to start ircd.py and the IRCd should start fine. As default, pyIS forks itself and go in background mode, but windows doesn't have fork, so pyIS take an exception on it and starts without forking.
If you don't like to see the prompt, just rename ircd.py to ircd.pyw.

CONTRIBUTE
pyIrcServer is hosted by IOSN - www.iosn.it/projects/pyircserver
You can help us by writing bugs (and if you can write the patch too) on that page or by using the mailing list.

If you want to become a member of pyIrcServer, please contact us and let's know what you can do against this project. You can help both as beta tester and coder.
Coders need to know Python, IRC protocol and PostgreSQL (optional).
