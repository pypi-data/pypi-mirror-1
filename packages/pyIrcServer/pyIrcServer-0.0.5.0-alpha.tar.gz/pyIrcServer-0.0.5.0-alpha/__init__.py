U{pyIrcServer<http://home.gna.org/pyircserver>} (or pyIS) is a powerful and very personalizable IRCd. You can use it on several platforms that can run U{Python<http://www.python.org>} (like Linux, Windows, MAC, and others) and set up a very personalizable config. pyIS is runnable as you download it, just a click and it's ready! This is possible because its code is interpreted, so you don't need to compile the sources.

You can add or remove features by changing modules, classes and utils.
	- The modules expand the classes
	- The classes expand the entire IRCd
	- The utils help the developer

You can totally change the aspect of your IRCd by changing classes and modules, and in order to be very configurable, the configuration file too.

You can help us as developer or standard user:
	- As standard user who don't want to modify the sources, you can contribute by submitting bugs to let's make patches and make pyIrcServer more stable
	- As developer you can contribute by improving new features and make patches
