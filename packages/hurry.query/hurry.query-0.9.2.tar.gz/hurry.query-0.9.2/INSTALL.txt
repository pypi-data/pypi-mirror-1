Installation
------------

hurry.query needs Zope 3.1 or Zope 3.2. 

Make sure hurry.query's src directory is on the Python path somehow,
and then copy hurry.query-configure.zcml into your Zope's
`etc/package-includes` directory.

hurry.query also has support for zc.catalog SetIndexes in
hurry.query.set. If you want to use this extension, you need to
install zc.catalog. It can be found in Zope's SVN repository.  You
then also need to copy `zc.catalog-configure.zcml` into your Zope's
`etc/package-includes` directory.
