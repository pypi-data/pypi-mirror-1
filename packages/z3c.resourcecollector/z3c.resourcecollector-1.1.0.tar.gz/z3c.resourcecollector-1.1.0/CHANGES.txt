   CSSIE6CollectorViewlet and CSSIE7CollectorViewlet

2008/02/01 1.0.4
----------------

 - make it possible to add collector items before the collector is defined

2008/02/01 1.0.3
----------------

 - use extra to render the type in renderElement because type has special
   meaning.

------------------

1.0.0

Initial release
---------------

Create zcml directives for creating a custom resource.
It collects javascripts and css files and merges them into a single resource.
It behaves exactly as a normal resource.
Also provides 2 viewlets JSCollectorViewlet, and CSSCollectorViewlet.
These viewlets are returning the html element what can reach the collector resource.
Also adds a hash in the end of the resource for versionning.
