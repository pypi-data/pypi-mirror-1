        ===========
        
        This buildout recipe can be used setup a Django project
        and to deploy it  using djangohosting.ch hosting services.
        
        
        Supported options
        =================
        
        The recipe supports the following options.
        
        project
        This option sets the name for your project. The recipe will create a
        basic structure if the project is not already there.
        
        version
        The version argument can accept a few different types of
        arguments. You can specify `trunk`. In this case it will do a
        checkout of the Django trunk. Another option is to specify a release
        number like `0.96.2`. This will download the release
        tarball. Finally you can specify a full svn url (including the
        revision number). An example of this would be
        `http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/branches/newforms-admin@7833`.
        
        django-wc-path
        Path the working copy of the Django project (trunk, tags and branches included).
        `/usr/share/django` by default. When using a checkout of django
        (instead of release tarball), the recipe will first try to it copy from
        djangohosting.ch working copy.
        
        settings
        You can set the name of the settings file which is to be used with
        this option. This is useful if you want to have a different
        production setup from your development setup. It defaults to
        `development`.

        Value of MEDIA_URL Django settings. Defaults to `/media/`

        directory.
        
        admin-media-url
        Value of ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX Django settings. Defaults to `/admin_media/`
        
        admin-media-directory
        Used to create an alias in a lighttpd configuration file. Defaults to
        the `media` folder in the admin's Django folder.
        
        (init|lighttpd|private|public-html)-directory
        Path (absolute or relative) to the `init`, `lighttpd`, `private`
        and `public_html` directories. Defaults `init`, `lighttpd`, `private`
        and `public_html`.

        development-port
        Port of development server. defaults to `8000`.
        
        download-cache
        Set this to a folder somewhere on you system to speed up
        installation. The recipe will use this folder as a cache for a
        downloaded version of Django.
        
        extra-paths
        All paths specified here will be used to extend the default Python
        path for the `bin/*` scripts.
        
        test
        If you want a script in the bin folder to run all the tests for a
        specific set of apps this is the option you would use. Set this to
        the list of app labels which you want to be tested.
