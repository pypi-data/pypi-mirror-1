setuptools_mtn is a plug-in to make setuptools smart about Monotone.

By default, setuptools will automatically include files checked in to
Subversion or CVS.  This plug-in adds the same functionality for
Monotone.

To use this plug-in, just install the egg.  That's it.  You can run
something like `python setup.py egg_info` in a project that uses
Monotone and you'll find that `your-project.egg-info/SOURCES.txt`
contains all the files checked in to Monotone.

Please send problems, patches, comments, etc. to me:
