collective.checkpermission
==========================

Sometimes you may want to protect a browser view method against a particular permission.
Using the provided check_permission decorator you will be able to protect those methods without 
having to modify your methods code.

The decorator uses internally a multiadapter, you will be able to have different settings for context
and type of view.
