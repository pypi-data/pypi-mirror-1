        GrokIMDB
        ********
        
        This is a nifty little demo application for Grok.
        
        It provides a userinterface to fetch and edit data retrieved from the
        Internet Movie Database (IMDb).
        
        Prerequisites
        =============
        
        You need
        
        - Python 2.4 and
        
        -`setuptools`
        
        to run this application. Rumors are, that also Python 2.5 will work.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        To install this package, run::
        
        $ python2.4 bootstrap/bootstrap.py
        
        which should create a `bin/` directory containing a `buildout` script.
        
        Next, run::
        
        $ bin/buildout
        
        which should setup everything, fetch needed packages from the net
        etc.
        
        
        Run the Application
        ===================
        
        This can be done in three steps.
        
        
        1) Start the Zope-Server
        ------------------------
        
        To start the application in the background, run::
        
        $ bin/zopectl start
        
        and stop it with::
        
        $ bin/zopectl stop
        
        Tests are run doing::
        
        $ bin/test
        
        If you want to run the application in foreground, you can do::
        
        $ bin/zopectl fg
        
        The server can then be stopped hitting CTRL-D.
        
        
        2) Log into the admin interface
        -------------------------------
        
        One server can serve several instances of GrokIMDB. Therefore we
        firstly have to create an instance of it. To do this, we use the Grok
        admin interface, which can be reached via::
        
        http://localhost:8080/
        
        Open that URL in a browser. You will be asked for a username/password.
        
        Enter::
        
        
        grok
        
        and
        
        grok
        
        That should log you in.
        
        
        3) Create an instance of GrokIMDB
        ---------------------------------
        
        Now enter a name for your new GrokIMDB instance and click 'Add'. This
        should create a new instance of GrokIMDB, that will be displayed.
        
        To go to your new GrokIMDB, just click on the freshly created link.
        
        
        Development
        ===========
        
        GrokIMDB can give you only a rough sketch of all possibilities of
        Grok. You can develop the application further by modifying the sources
        in the `src/` directory. Note, that you have to restart the server,
        when classes or similar things were changed.

        ======================
        
        There is an excellent tutorial on the Grok homepage::

        Happy Grokking!
