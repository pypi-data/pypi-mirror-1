This directory contains various MusicXML files from different programs.

These files are only for testing purposes during initial
development.  We will want to collect better example data
in the future, but this is a good start.

If you have (possibly already corrected) MusicXML files of music
without license problems (anything that is on mutopiaproject.org is a good
candidate) please consider contributing your data.
