List of things that should be implemented at some point:
--------------------------------------------------------
 * Fix accidental announcement to not print accidentals if they were already
   stated in a previous measure.  Currently, we print accidentals as they
   are present on the score according to the MusicXML file.  This can actually
   be a feature, but for compliance with braille music, we should avoid
   reprinting them.
 * Detect repeated note groups in measures.  See next item.
 * Support for note grouping according to the braille music standard.
 * Support for chord symbols (harmony).
 * A widget for rendering a Measure instance in visual notation on-screen (GTK).
   This should be integrated into the braille music editing GUI, so that
   changes in either format update the other representation.
