Cisco Password decryption
=========================

IOS can store passwords two ways... the first is by using enable-secrets...
these can NOT be decrypted; however, normal passwords and other sensitive IOS
strings can be decrypted.  You can recognize them by looking for a "7" before
the password hash.  See the example below...

username joe password 7 023530612D5319347A

Cisco never intended type 7 passwords to be completely secure... they are
simply used for hiding passwords from someone reading the config over your
shoulder.

This module can be used to read in type 7 passwords and decrypt them.  It can
either be used from the command line, or as a python package.  Note that I
included this decryption package in my IOS config parsing package.  If you
also need to parse configs, just download ciscoconfparse from the Cheeseshop
and use the CiscoPassword class.
