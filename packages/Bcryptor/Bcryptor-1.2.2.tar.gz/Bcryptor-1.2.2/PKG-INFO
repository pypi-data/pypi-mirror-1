Description: Bcrypt is an implementation of a modern password hashing algorithm, based on
        the Blowfish block cipher, by Niels Provos and David Mazieres. It has been
        the default password scheme since OpenBSD 2.1.
        
        A paper on the algorithm that explains its design decisions is available here:
        http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix99/provos.html
        
        The most important property of *bcrypt* is that it is adaptable to future
        processor performance improvements, allowing you to arbitrarily increase the
        processing cost of checking a password while still maintaining compatibility
        with your older password hashes.
        
        This package provides a high level object oriented wrapper around *bcrypt*,
        as well as low level bindings to the C library. It uses the random number
        generator `random.SystemRandom()` to create the salts.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        To build the module from source code, read documentation on *doc/source.txt*.
        
        Logging
        -------
        Yamlog_ manages the error catching code and error reporting. Read its
        documentation if want to be set up.
        
        Use
        ---
        Typical usage::
        
        import bcryptor
        
        hasher = bcryptor.Bcrypt()
        hash = hasher.create('crack my pass')
        
        And to validate::
        
        >>> hasher.valid('crack my pass', hash)
        True
        >>> hasher.valid('Crack my pass', hash)
        False

        Change history
        ==============
        
        v1.2.2, 2010-02-26
        ------------------
        * Fixed an import error at loading the package to get its docstring. It doesn't
        works when is imported a module generated by *cython* which has not built.
        
        v1.2.1, 2010-02-25
        ------------------
        * Added a null handler to logging, since *Yamlog* could not has been set up.
        
        v1.2, 2010-02-24
        ----------------
        * The license has been changed to ISC.
        * For indentation, is used 4 spaces as is indicated in *PEP-8*.
        * The manage of exceptions and imports has been improved.
        * Better docstrings.
        * The values of cost can be changed at instancing `Bcrypt()`.
        * Changed from *Pyrex* to *Cython*.
        * The logging is managed through *Yamlog*.
        
        v1.1, 2009-05-20
        ----------------
        * Initial release.
