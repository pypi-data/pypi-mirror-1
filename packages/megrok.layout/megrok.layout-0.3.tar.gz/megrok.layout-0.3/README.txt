Introduction
============

The `megrok.layout` package provides a simple way to write view
components which can be included into a defined layout. It turns
around two main components : the Page and the Layout.

  >>> import grok
  >>> grok.placeless_setup()
  >>> grok.grok('megrok.layout')

Layout
------
The layout is a component allowing you to design your site. Often,
it's the common structure shared between all the pages. It is a class
based on the view components interface, providing a 'render' and
'update' method. A layout is an adapter registered for the context and
the request. The layout's render method is what is going to be called
when you try to render a Page element.

Page
----
The page is the specific code that you want to control. It is based on
the grokcore.View browser page implementation and therefore provides a
'render' and 'update' method. The 'render' method will simply return the
specific HTML code generated by the template or the 'render' method
code while '__call__' will lookup for a Layout component and renders
itself inside it.
